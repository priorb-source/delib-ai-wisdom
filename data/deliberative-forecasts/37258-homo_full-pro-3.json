    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the primary factors driving this forecast: the prohibitive UK Supreme Court ruling, the extremely short timeline compressed further by a by-election embargo, and the Scottish Government's recent pivot to domestic policy. Their analyses were highly convincing. In particular, Forecaster 3's emphasis on the May 2026 Holyrood elections as a more plausible strategic focus for the independence movement was a key point. This provides a clear, alternative path for the SNP that makes a high-risk, symbolic referendum announcement in the immediate future less likely and less politically coherent.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 5% to 2%. My initial reasoning correctly identified the major barriers to a 'Yes' outcome. However, I now believe I assigned slightly too much weight to the possibility of the Scottish Government making a purely symbolic announcement to rally its base. The other forecasters persuasively argued that such a move runs counter to a more patient, and likely more effective, political strategy centered on building a mandate at the 2026 Holyrood elections. Announcing a referendum with no viable legal path forward now could be seen as a strategic error that could damage their standing ahead of that crucial election. The convergence of all factors—the legal impossibility, the lack of political appetite from key figures like Nicola Sturgeon, the focus on domestic issues, and the more logical long-term strategy of targeting 2026—points to an overwhelmingly high probability of the status quo holding until the July 1, 2025 deadline. The remaining 2% chance accounts for a highly unexpected political event or a sudden, dramatic miscalculation by the Scottish Government.",
