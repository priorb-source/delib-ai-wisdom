    "review": "New, useful inputs: (1) Forecaster 2’s note on June 2 Istanbul talks and Peskov tying any high-level summit with Trump to those talks’ outcomes; (2) the White House reportedly not sending an official delegation; (3) Forecaster 3’s reminders of prior mutual invitations and possible June hooks like SPIEF. I find Forecaster 2’s points most decision-relevant: a contingent, third-party track with no formal U.S. participation lowers near-term odds of a Russia-hosted summit; and even if talks progress, neutral venues remain more plausible. Forecaster 3’s 8% feels high absent concrete travel/logistics signals; mutual invitations raise the chance of a 2025 meeting somewhere, but not specifically in Russia in June. Overall, their arguments reinforce my prior view rather than shift it upward.",
    "rationale": "- Time left is ~1 month. Presidential Russia visits are rare, politically costly amid the Ukraine war, and logistically complex; they’re usually telegraphed. Surprise leader trips tend to be to friendly or controlled environments, or to neutral ground for delicate diplomacy.\n- The late-May rhetoric (“absolutely crazy,” “very disappointed”) plus a two-week wait-and-see stance argues against an immediate conciliatory move like a Russia trip. Even a rapid peace track would likely convene on neutral territory.\n- Forecaster 2’s added context—June 2 Istanbul talks, Peskov conditioning any Trump summit on those outcomes, and no official U.S. delegation—further reduces the plausibility of a June-in-Russia meeting. If there is movement, it increases the odds of a third-country venue rather than Moscow/St. Petersburg, especially on short notice.\n- Tail risk persists due to Trump’s unpredictability and potential appetite for dramatic diplomacy. A fast ceasefire framework tied to a high-visibility signing in Russia could create a late-June window, but we lack any credible reporting of advance teams, NOTAMs, or scheduling indicators.\n- Net: the new inputs are directionally consistent with my prior and don’t supply the kind of concrete signals that would warrant moving up. I remain low and vigilant for logistics/venue leaks. I would update up materially only on credible reports of a June Russia venue with security prep underway; I would move down further if Istanbul talks stall or a neutral-site meeting is announced for June.",
