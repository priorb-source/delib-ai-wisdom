    "review": "New and useful points from the others: (1) Forecaster 2’s concrete license-to-availability lags for recent African launches (DRC ≈10 weeks; Malawi/Zambia ≈16; Benin ≈24) anchor the timeline better than my earlier general range. (2) The claimed May 2025 Airtel Africa distribution deal (Airtel operates in Chad) could materially reduce import/distribution friction and supports a June flip. (3) The distinction between a November 2024 “license reported” and a March 13, 2025 official grant is important for selecting the operative clock—if March is the real start, July 1 is ~16 weeks, right in the mid‑range of recent precedents. (4) Forecaster 3’s emphasis on the short remaining window and the lack of visible precursors (reseller/pricing/type-approval signals) is a valid counterweight and suggests caution.\n\nWhat I find convincing: F2’s empirical lag comparisons and the quarter‑end batching pattern are strong, and the Niger activation suggests no regional capacity bottleneck. F3’s point about the absence of pre‑launch signals is also meaningful—Starlink often flips with little lead time, but usually there’s at least some chatter, and we’re inside ~6–7 weeks.\n\nWhat I find less convincing: F3’s 6–12 month lag as a general African base rate feels dated given 2024–25 acceleration; recent cases often fall within 10–24 weeks. Also, using the November 2024 report as the operative date likely misreads the regulatory sequence if the official grant occurred March 13, 2025.",
    "rationale": "I now weight March 13, 2025 as the operative license date. That places July 1 at ~16 weeks—squarely in the mid‑range of recent African license‑to‑live lags cited by F2. The Niger go‑live and potential Airtel partnership both increase plausibility of a Q2 batch update that includes Chad. However, the remaining 6.5 weeks and the lack of visible precursors (pricing page assets, local distributor announcements, or regulator type‑approval notes) temper confidence. Chad’s smaller market and potential administrative steps (import/type approvals, pricing alignment) could easily slip activation into early Q3.\n\nNet: I stay modestly above 50% due to the March license timing, regional cadence, and possible Airtel facilitation, but trim slightly from my prior 61% to reflect the short window and absence of signals.",
