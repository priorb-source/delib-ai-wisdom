    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in broad agreement on the primary factors at play: the very short timeframe, the significance of Casey DeSantis not having announced yet, and the major political headwind created by Donald Trump's endorsement of Byron Donalds. Forecaster 2's analysis closely mirrors my own initial thoughts, reinforcing the view that the status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome. However, Forecaster 3 introduced a crucial argument that I had not adequately considered: the strategic incentive to announce before the June 30 end-of-quarter fundraising deadline. This is a very convincing point, as posting a strong Q2 fundraising number would be a powerful way for her campaign to demonstrate viability and counter the narrative suggested by the recent negative polling. This provides a specific, plausible, and time-sensitive reason for a 'Yes' outcome that my initial analysis lacked.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upwards from 10%. My initial reasoning was heavily weighted by the powerful disincentives for an announcement, namely the recent poll showing Byron Donalds in the lead following a Donald Trump endorsement. These factors still make a 'No' outcome the most probable result. However, after deliberating with my colleagues, I find Forecaster 3's argument regarding the Q2 fundraising deadline compelling. Announcing before July 1 would allow Casey DeSantis to post a fundraising total for the second quarter. A strong showing would be a strategic necessity to prove her campaign's viability to donors and counter the perception of weakness created by the poll. This provides a tangible, strategic rationale for a June announcement that I previously underestimated. While the political hurdles are immense, this fundraising consideration significantly increases the odds of an announcement within this specific timeframe. Therefore, I am increasing my probability from 10% to 19% to better reflect this balance of countervailing forces.",
