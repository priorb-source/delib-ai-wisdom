    "review": "The deliberation with my colleagues reveals a strong consensus on the key drivers of this forecast. All three of us identified the same critical factors: 1) Virgin Galactic is in an extended flight hiatus, reducing the main source of operational news. 2) The most predictable news event in May, the Q1 earnings release, has a strong precedent of being handled through investor relations channels and not posted on the main News page. 3) The company is already in a three-month posting gap, establishing a status quo of silence. There were no new facts or fundamentally different lines of reasoning introduced. The minor difference in probability between my forecast (75%) and Forecaster 2's (70%) reflects a slightly different weighting of the chance of an unforeseen, ad-hoc announcement, rather than a disagreement on the evidence. Forecaster 3's analysis was almost identical to my own.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 75%. Their reasoning strongly reinforces my original conclusion. Both other forecasters agree that the historical base rate of posting (50% of the last 10 months) is less relevant than the current context of the flight hiatus and the established communication pattern for financial results. The fact that the most likely scheduled corporate announcement for May—the Q1 2025 earnings release—will almost certainly be routed away from the News page is the most powerful piece of evidence. The analyses of the other forecasters did not introduce new information or compelling counterarguments that would warrant a change. They confirmed the central thesis of my forecast, and I remain confident that the combination of no flights and segregated financial news makes another month of silence on the main News page the most likely outcome.",
