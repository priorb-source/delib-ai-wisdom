    "review": "Both forecasters correctly emphasize the very short timeline and the inertia of immigration litigation. Forecaster 2’s argument leans on the slow-moving status quo and assigns a low prior (5%), which aligns with typical outcomes when a detention challenge is active. Forecaster 3 highlights the theoretical feasibility of removal within 48 days and assigns 20%, but provides no concrete signals of imminence (e.g., travel documents, no stay, scheduled removal). I find F2 more convincing: the existence of an advancing detention challenge usually correlates with removal not being imminent, and removals often stall on travel documents, stays, or court calendars. F3’s 20% seems high without any positive indicators. One nuance I’d add: if the litigation is a prolonged-detention challenge (as opposed to a petition for review with a stay motion), that typically signals removal isn’t reasonably foreseeable—further lowering near-term removal odds. Conversely, if there’s already a final order, travel documents in hand, and no stay, ICE can sometimes remove within weeks—keeping a small nonzero probability.",
    "rationale": "Time left is ~48 days. The background implies active detention litigation, which commonly means at least one of: no travel documents yet, a stay sought or in place, or contested removal logistics. Executing deportation in this window requires (1) a final order, (2) no active stay, (3) receiving-country acceptance and valid travel documents, and (4) flight scheduling. We have zero evidence any of these conditions are satisfied, let alone all. Base rates for contested removals completing inside ~6–7 weeks without public signals of imminence are low. I initially set 8% to reflect small chances that legal relief is denied quickly and ICE already has documents lined up. After weighing F2 and F3, I tilt slightly lower due to the strong status-quo inertia and lack of any positive indicators, but keep above 5% to allow for a quick adverse ruling and pre-arranged logistics. I would move up with news of travel documents issued, denial of a stay, or a scheduled removal; down with any stay order, court scheduling beyond July 1, or indications of difficulty obtaining travel documents.",
