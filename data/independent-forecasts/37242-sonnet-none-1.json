    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. Today is April 30, 2025, and the April 2025 data is expected to be published in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - Passenger arrivals continue their growth trend or remain stable. The example data shows February 2025 (2,248,198) exceeded February 2024 (2,199,255), representing approximately 2.2% year-over-year growth.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 arrivals equal or exceed April 2024 levels. This occurs if the general positive tourism trend continues, driven by strong European demand (the primary market for Canary Islands), favorable Easter timing, good weather conditions, and any potential US tourism decline being offset by growth from other markets or representing too small a share to matter.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 arrivals fall below April 2024 levels. This occurs if Trump's trade policies materially dampened US tourist arrivals, broader European economic concerns reduced travel demand, unfavorable calendar effects (Easter timing), weather disruptions, or other unforeseen shocks (economic, geopolitical, health-related) that negatively impacted travel to the Canary Islands during April 2025.",
    "rationale": "The most recent comparable data (February 2025 vs February 2024) shows year-over-year growth of 2.2%, establishing a baseline expectation of continued growth. This status quo bias is important since tourism trends typically change gradually rather than abruptly. The Canary Islands primarily attract European tourists from the UK, Germany, and Spain, with US tourists representing a small fraction of total arrivals (likely under 5-10%). Therefore, even significant US tourism impacts from Trump's policies would have limited effect on overall numbers. The research assistant provided no additional information suggesting disruptions to April 2025 tourism. Without evidence of major shocks or disruptions specific to April 2025, the default expectation should favor continuation of the growth trend. However, I cannot assign extremely high confidence to NO because: (1) I lack data between February and April 2025 to confirm trend continuation, (2) the article raises legitimate concerns about policy impacts that could have materialized, (3) April-specific factors (Easter timing, weather, economic conditions) remain uncertain, and (4) unforeseen events could have occurred. The probability would be lower for NO if I had evidence of: significant deterioration in European economies, major disruptions to travel in Q2 2025, or actual data showing declining trends in March 2025. The probability would be higher for NO with: confirmation of March 2025 growth, evidence of strong Q2 booking trends, or data showing US tourism impact was minimal.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
