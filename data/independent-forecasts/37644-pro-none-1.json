    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Anthropic will not announce that it is planning an IPO before July 1, 2025, and will remain a private company through the resolution date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic's leadership decides that market conditions are not optimal or that the company would be better served by remaining private to focus on its long-term research and safety goals without the quarterly pressures of public shareholders. The company may pursue another round of private funding instead, and the July 1, 2025, deadline passes without an S-1 filing or a formal announcement on its website.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seeking to capitalize on the strong market appetite for AI companies and provide liquidity for early investors and employees, Anthropic's board approves an IPO. Having worked on the preparations in private, the company either files a Form S-1 with the SEC or issues a press release on the 'News' section of its website announcing its intention to go public before the July 1, 2025, deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the extremely short timeframe between today (May 15, 2025) and the resolution date (July 1, 2025). The status quo is that Anthropic is a private company, and initiating an IPO is a significant, complex, and lengthy process. While preparations could be happening in secret, an announcement within the next six weeks is unlikely. Companies often prefer to remain private as long as possible to avoid the regulatory burdens and short-term earnings pressure associated with being public. Furthermore, the fact that Anthropic has been successful in raising massive amounts of capital from private markets (e.g., Google, Amazon) reduces the immediate necessity of a public offering for funding. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 10% because the pressures for an IPO are substantial. The AI sector is incredibly capital-intensive, and an IPO could raise the necessary funds for Anthropic to remain competitive. Additionally, early investors will be seeking an exit to realize their returns, and the current market enthusiasm for AI stocks presents a potentially lucrative window. A surprise announcement, while improbable, is not impossible.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because of the timeline. Six weeks is a very narrow window for such a major corporate event to be announced. If the forecast period were 12-18 months, my probability would be significantly higher. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see credible reports from financial news outlets (like Bloomberg or Reuters) citing sources that Anthropic has confidentially filed paperwork or hired lead underwriters for an IPO. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if Anthropic were to announce another large private funding round, as this would signal their intent to remain private for the medium term.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
