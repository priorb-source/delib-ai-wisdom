    "review": "Both other forecasters provided compelling arguments that have caused me to significantly revise my initial forecast downward. Forecaster 2's quantitative analysis of the historical base rate was particularly persuasive. Their calculation, showing 4-6 African pilot reports to NUFORC over 10 years, establishes a strong anchor of a 3.3-5% probability for any given month. This is a much more rigorous foundation than my initial, more qualitative assessment, and it highlights that my 12% forecast was likely an overreaction to a single recent data point.\n\nForecaster 3's qualitative breakdown of the multiple 'gates' a report must pass to resolve 'Yes' effectively reinforced the low-probability nature of the question. They also introduced a key point I hadn't fully weighed: the potential for a slight increase in reporting due to heightened global UAP attention. While a soft factor, it provides a rationale for hedging slightly above the strict historical base rate.\n\nTheir combined analyses convinced me that I overweighted the significance of the January 2025 Rwanda report. I treated it as evidence of a new, higher trend, whereas they more correctly framed it as confirmation that the reporting channel is active, justifying a forecast above near-zero but not a wholesale departure from the historical baseline. The convergence of their forecasts in the 6-8% range strongly suggests my initial 12% was an outlier.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 12% was based heavily on the recent January 2025 pilot report from Rwanda, which I interpreted as a signal of potentially increasing reporting frequency from the region. After reviewing my peers' analyses, I now believe this was an over-interpretation of a single data point.\n\nI am significantly updating my forecast downward, primarily due to Forecaster 2's robust quantitative analysis. The historical base rate of approximately 0.4-0.6 African pilot reports per year (or a 3.3-5% chance per month) is a much stronger anchor than the single recent event. A 10-year average is more reliable evidence than an N of 1.\n\nHowever, I am not dropping my forecast to the absolute bottom of that base rate range. I am persuaded by Forecaster 3's arguments about factors that could slightly elevate the probability above the strict historical average. These include the general increase in global attention on UAPs, which may marginally increase the propensity of pilots to report, and the fact that the January 2025 report confirms the NUFORC reporting pipeline from Africa is currently functional. These factors justify a modest premium on the historical base rate.\n\nTherefore, I am moving my forecast from 12% down to 8%. This new forecast aligns with Forecaster 3 and represents a synthesis of the group's insights: it is anchored by the low historical probability but adjusted slightly upward to account for recent activity and current environmental factors.",
