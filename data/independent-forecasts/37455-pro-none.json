    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the license being granted in April 2025, minor bureaucratic delays, final technical validations, or logistical prioritization of other markets by Starlink push the official service launch just past the July 1, 2025 deadline. The availability map is not updated in time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the April 14, 2025 license grant, Starlink swiftly completes the final regulatory and technical steps for service activation. Leveraging existing satellite coverage and ground stations in the region, they update their availability map to show Lesotho as 'Available' sometime in May or June 2025.",
    "rationale": "The key piece of evidence is the granting of an operating license to Starlink by Lesotho on April 14, 2025. This clears the single largest hurdle for service activation. Starlink has a strong incentive and a track record of expanding service relatively quickly once regulatory approvals are secured. The primary factor weighing against a 'Yes' outcome is the short timeline of less than two months until the July 1, 2025 deadline. While Starlink's deployment speed is increasing, this timeframe leaves little room for common, minor administrative or technical delays. Lesotho is a small country and can be covered by existing satellite constellations and likely serviced by ground stations in other nearby licensed countries (like Mozambique), reducing the logistical burden. The status quo is 'No' as service is not yet active, but the recent license grant is a powerful catalyst for change that outweighs the inertia. The forecast is not higher than 85% to account for the possibility of unforeseen, short-term bureaucratic or logistical delays that could easily consume the ~55 days remaining. My forecast is not lower because the granting of the license is the most difficult step, and the remaining tasks are well within Starlink's operational capabilities to complete within this timeframe, as seen in other recent country launches. I would increase my forecast if Starlink or the Lesotho government announced a specific launch date in May or June. I would decrease it if any reports emerged of last-minute regulatory snags or if Starlink's own map updated to show a launch in a later quarter (e.g., 'Q3 2025').",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Lesotho as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lesotho grants license to Musk's Starlink](https://www.ewn.co.za/2025/04/14/lesotho-grants-license-to-musks-starlink)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Lesotho listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
