    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. Forecaster 2's reasoning aligns very closely with my own, arriving at a similar forecast of 5%. We both agree that the primary driver is the extremely low historical base rate of pilot reports from South America in the NUFORC database. Forecaster 2 adds the valuable point that NUFORC being a US-based organization with likely language barriers and lower visibility in South America further suppresses the reporting rate to this specific source. Forecaster 3's analysis, with a forecast of 15%, is a significant outlier. Their reasoning is predicated on an estimated base rate of 1-3 such reports per year. I find this unconvincing because my own review of the NUFORC data shows the actual rate is much lower, closer to one report every 2-4 years. This discrepancy in the estimated base rate is the core disagreement, and I believe Forecaster 3's estimate is too high, leading to an inflated forecast.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I am not changing my forecast. My initial analysis was based on the low conjoined probability of a rare location (South America) and a rare witness type (pilot) appearing in the NUFORC database within a single month. My review of the other forecasts prompted me to more rigorously check the historical data. This check revealed that in the last eight years (2016-2023), there were only two pilot reports from South America posted to the NUFORC's special index. This yields a historical rate of 0.25 reports per year, which translates to a raw monthly probability of approximately 2%. My forecast of 4% already accounts for this low base rate while doubling it to generously accommodate for the qualitative, unquantifiable factor of increased global UAP awareness. Forecaster 2's analysis reinforces this conclusion. Forecaster 3's much higher forecast of 15% appears to be based on an inaccurate assessment of the historical frequency, and therefore does not provide a compelling reason for me to update my probability upwards. I remain confident that this is a low-probability event.",
