    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month (from May 31, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the borders remain closed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Benin maintains the border closure due to ongoing security concerns about the Mahmuda terror group, arms smuggling, and unresolved trade disputes regarding soya exportation. Diplomatic negotiations either don't occur, proceed too slowly, or fail to address Benin's concerns within the one-month timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Rapid diplomatic engagement between Benin and Nigeria (federal or Kwara state level) produces an agreement. Nigeria implements security measures or policy changes that satisfy Benin's concerns about terrorism and smuggling. Economic pressure from affected border communities and traders accelerates negotiations, leading to a swift resolution and border reopening.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is challenging due to the extremely compressed timeframe - only about 1 month remains until the resolution date. Several factors point toward a low probability: (1) The border closure is very recent, occurring in May 2025, meaning we're only weeks after the decision was made. (2) The stated reasons are serious security concerns including a new terror group (Mahmuda), arms smuggling, and trade disputes - these are not trivial issues that get resolved quickly. (3) Historical precedent suggests border closures between Nigeria and Benin can be protracted (Nigeria's 2019-2020 closure lasted over a year). (4) The research assistant found no additional information about ongoing diplomatic efforts or progress toward reopening. (5) Status quo bias strongly favors the borders remaining closed - governments rarely reverse major security decisions within weeks. My forecast is not higher because there's no evidence of active high-level negotiations or diplomatic breakthroughs in progress. The one-month window is insufficient for addressing complex security and trade concerns. My forecast is not lower (I'm giving it 15% rather than 5%) because emergency diplomatic interventions can occasionally produce rapid results, particularly if economic impacts are severe enough to motivate urgent action from both governments. For me to update higher, I would need to see credible reports of active negotiations, ministerial-level meetings, or public statements indicating progress toward resolution. For me to update lower, I would need confirmation that diplomatic channels remain inactive or that Benin has stated the closure will be long-term.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Benin re-open its closed land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Exclusive: Benin Rep.

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Benin's land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state that were closed in May 2025 are [credibly](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) reported to have been reopened.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
