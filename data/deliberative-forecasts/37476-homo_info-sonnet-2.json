    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises critical financial metrics I had not fully internalized: a current ratio of 0.5 (meaning current liabilities are double current assets), a devastating 54% loss margin, and an estimated cash burn rate of ~$36M/month that could leave only ~$100M remaining. These are severe insolvency indicators that significantly increase bankruptcy risk. Forecaster 3 provides important counterbalancing evidence about operational continuity - the company launched a Max camera in February 2025 and a Hero13 in May 2025, and renewed sponsorships. Companies typically don't launch products immediately before bankruptcy. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize the constraining 53-day timeframe. The most compelling new information is Forecaster 2's current ratio of 0.5, which represents genuine liquidity crisis territory. However, Forecaster 3's observation about recent product launches and the lack of bankruptcy warning signs (no restructuring advisors, no covenant violation announcements) is also significant. The Q1 2025 results on May 12 could be pivotal - if they reveal exhausted cash reserves or covenant breaches, bankruptcy could come quickly.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 6% to 12%. The specific financial metrics provided by Forecaster 2, particularly the current ratio of 0.5 and the estimated remaining cash position, indicate GoPro is in more severe financial distress than my initial analysis captured. These metrics suggest genuine insolvency risk rather than mere operational struggles. However, I'm not adopting Forecaster 2's 20% forecast because several factors still argue against bankruptcy in this specific 53-day window: (1) the company is actively launching new products (May 2025 Hero13 release), which is inconsistent with imminent bankruptcy; (2) there are no reported immediate triggers like debt defaults or covenant violations; (3) the convertible note doesn't mature until November 2025, providing some runway; (4) bankruptcy filings typically require exhaustion of alternatives and formal decisions that take time even in crisis. The 12% forecast acknowledges both the severe financial distress that could force rapid action and the operational/temporal constraints that make filing unlikely before July 1. The upcoming Q1 results on May 12 will be crucial - worse-than-expected results could push probability higher, while evidence of stabilization would push it lower.",
