    "review": "Both forecasters’ reasoning closely matches mine: short window, localized insurgency in Cabo Delgado, US preference for regional “Do Not Travel” within an overall Level 2/3, and Level 4 generally tied to nationwide crises or Embassy drawdowns. Forecaster 2’s point about SADC/Rwandan posture shifts as a potential risk vector is a useful nuance, and both emphasize Embassy posture changes and significant attacks in southern urban centers as key triggers—consistent with State’s past behavior. No new hard evidence was introduced to suggest an imminent shift, but the added emphasis on potential force posture changes and specific urban targets modestly strengthens the tail-risk case.",
    "rationale": "Status quo remains below Level 4 with localized restrictions in the north. To reach Level 4 by July 1, the most plausible catalysts would be: (1) Embassy Maputo ordering or authorizing departure/major service curtailment; (2) multiple, high-impact terrorist attacks or sustained violent unrest in Maputo/Beira/Nampula indicating nationwide instability; (3) a coup/state failure scenario; or (4) a catastrophic disaster or health emergency. The 60-day window and the post–cyclone-season timing make these scenario bundles unlikely absent fresh signals. I slightly raise my estimate to reflect peers’ emphasis on potential security force posture changes (SADC drawdown/Rwanda dynamics) that could marginally elevate near-term volatility in Cabo Delgado, though such changes still rarely trigger a nationwide Level 4 absent spillover to major population centers or Embassy constraints. Net: low single-digit probability with clear upside triggers to watch.",
