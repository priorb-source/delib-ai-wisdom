    "review": "All three forecasters converged remarkably on 85-87%, which strengthens my confidence in the core reasoning. The other forecasters raised several compelling points: (1) Forecaster 2's emphasis on institutional frictions - employment contracts and severance requirements create barriers to rapid layoffs, making April mass terminations unlikely even if tariffs were announced earlier; (2) Forecaster 3's concrete quantification that normal monthly volatility rarely exceeds 0.1-0.2 percentage points, compared to the 0.8-point jump needed to breach 3%; and (3) Both emphasized more forcefully than I did that April has ALREADY ENDED - the outcome is determined, we're just awaiting publication. This reduces uncertainty about external shocks that could occur. The convergence itself is notable - three independent analysts arriving at nearly identical probabilities suggests we're correctly identifying the key factors. However, I remain mindful that this convergence could also represent anchoring or shared blind spots about unreported developments in April.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the other forecasters' analyses reinforce rather than challenge my initial reasoning. The institutional friction argument (contracts, severance) is particularly strong - even if firms decided to respond to tariffs in April, the mechanics of termination would delay the impact. The quantification of normal volatility (0.1-0.2 pp vs. 0.8 pp needed) makes the required jump seem even more extreme. The emphasis on April being completed reduces uncertainty. However, I maintain caution because: (1) the IMF's dire full-year projection suggests they see real structural problems that could manifest faster than typical, (2) we don't have visibility into unreported April developments, (3) measurement or seasonal adjustment issues could theoretically surprise us. The 2.2% March reading with its 0.8-point buffer remains the dominant factor. For unemployment to breach 3% would require roughly 450,000 additional unemployed people in one month - historically unprecedented for Mexico outside of major crises. No such crisis has been reported for April 2025.",
