  "information": "The U.S. State Department's travel advisory for Mozambique is currently 'Level 3: Reconsider Travel,' as of the last update on December 19, 2023. Specific northern regions of the country are under higher-level warnings. Recent security developments include suspected jihadist attacks in late April and early May 2025 in Niassa province, an area previously less impacted by the insurgency centered in Cabo Delgado. In response, the U.S. Embassy in Maputo issued specific warnings. The UK and Canada have also warned against travel to parts of Niassa and Cabo Delgado. Concurrently, ongoing post-election protests have led the African Travel & Tourism Association (ATTA) to issue its own travel advisory.\n\nThe U.S. State Department uses a four-level travel advisory system. Level 1 is 'Exercise Normal Precautions.' Level 2 is 'Exercise Increased Caution,' for heightened safety and security risks. Level 3, 'Reconsider Travel,' signifies serious risks. Level 4, 'Do Not Travel,' is the highest level, typically applied in cases of widespread violent conflict, civil war, uncontrolled crime, risk of wrongful detention, or severe breakdowns in national infrastructure. The advisories are determined based on factors including crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and health concerns. The State Department reviews advisories for Level 3 and 4 countries at least every six months.\n\nAs of early May 2025, the U.S. State Department has 'Level 4: Do Not Travel' advisories in effect for 21 countries. Reasons for these advisories include active conflicts, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and health emergencies. The list of countries includes Afghanistan, Belarus, Burkina Faso, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen. Some advisories have been updated recently; the advisory for South Sudan was elevated to Level 4 on March 8, 2025. In other instances, advisories are applied regionally, such as in Bangladesh, which has a country-wide Level 3 advisory but a Level 4 warning for the Chittagong Hill Tracts region.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Mozambique remains at Level 3: Reconsider Travel, with some northern areas flagged at Level 4 regionally, but not a countrywide Level 4.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Insurgent activity continues in Cabo Delgado and occasionally spills into Niassa, but remains geographically limited; protests flare intermittently without nationwide destabilization; the U.S. updates language and maintains regional “Do Not Travel” designations while keeping the overall country at Level 3.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid security deterioration such as coordinated large-scale attacks spreading beyond Cabo Delgado into major population centers, a successful assault on or siege of Pemba/Palma or key highways, high-profile kidnappings/killings of foreigners, and/or an embassy drawdown/ordered departure prompts the U.S. to elevate Mozambique to an overall Level 4. Alternatively, a sudden nationwide crisis (e.g., widespread violent unrest or a severe disruption to basic services) forces an upgrade.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: The U.S. State Department currently lists Mozambique at Level 3: Reconsider Travel, with higher-risk northern areas often singled out for Level 4 regionally. Recent reports note suspected jihadist attacks in Niassa in late April/early May 2025 and ongoing risks in Cabo Delgado. The U.S. Embassy in Maputo issued security alerts. UK/Canada have also tightened regional cautions. ATTA issued an advisory amid protests. The State Department tends to reserve a countrywide Level 4 for war zones, state collapse, or extreme, widespread risks. It reviews Level 3/4 advisories at least every six months. As of early May 2025, about 21 countries are Level 4, typically due to severe conflicts and pervasive instability.\n- Base rates and threshold: The jump from Level 3 to Level 4 nationwide within a short window is uncommon. Mozambique’s risk is serious but historically localized. The State Department often handles such cases with regional Level 4 warnings while keeping the national advisory at Level 3. That pattern, plus the high bar for Level 4, argue for a low probability within the next ~2 months.\n- Catalysts that could push to Level 4: A notable geographic expansion of insurgent control; high-profile attacks on foreigners; mass-casualty events in or near major cities; embassy ordered departure or drawdown; or widespread violent unrest. While Niassa incidents indicate some expansion, current signals still point to localized, episodic violence rather than nationwide breakdown.\n- Why not higher: The status quo strongly favors maintaining Level 3 with regional restrictions, and cyclone season is waning. Most Level 4 countries are facing broader, more systemic crises than Mozambique currently is.\n- Why not lower: There are fresh indicators of risk (Niassa attacks, embassy alerts, post-election tensions). A short, sharp escalation could occur, and the State Department could move quickly if Americans are directly targeted or if state control erodes visibly.\n- What would change my view: Upward if there is (1) a successful insurgent attack on a provincial capital or critical infrastructure with sustained fighting, (2) targeted kidnappings/killings of foreigners, (3) U.S. embassy ordered departure or substantial staff reduction, or (4) widespread violent unrest disrupting multiple cities. Downward if security incidents ebb, LNG-related areas remain secure, and embassy alerts quiet down, or if an interim State Department update explicitly reaffirms Level 3 while narrowing regional Level 4 zones.",
