    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. My initial forecast was 40%, Forecaster 2 is at 60%, and Forecaster 3 is at 74%. Forecaster 2 provided a solid, structured analysis of the uncertainties, which aligns well with the general challenges of this question. However, Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly impactful as it introduced a crucial piece of reasoning I had overlooked: the predictable activation of seasonal summer routes. Their bottom-up estimation of the destination portfolio, specifically highlighting likely additions of Turkish leisure destinations like Antalya for the summer season, is a compelling argument. This type of seasonal expansion is not speculative but a recurring feature of airline schedules, and the July 1 resolution date falls squarely in the period when these routes would be active. This argument significantly reframes the problem from one of adding entirely new, year-round destinations in a short time frame to one of observing a predictable seasonal peak.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 40% was based on the observation that the current number of destinations is very close to the threshold, and the timeframe for adding two or more net new destinations seemed short. I focused on the announcements of new carriers like Eurowings and Aegean but was skeptical that they would all represent unique new destinations. \n\nThe deliberation has convinced me to update my forecast significantly upwards. Forecaster 3’s argument regarding seasonal summer routes is the primary driver for this change. It is highly probable that by July 1, airlines will have activated their summer schedules, which for Erbil typically includes direct flights to Turkish holiday spots. This predictable seasonal increase could easily add one or two destinations on its own. \n\nCombining this insight with the other positive signals—the airport's infrastructure upgrades, ICAO certification progress, and the launch of a new route to Cologne/Bonn by Eurowings—paints a much more optimistic picture. A plausible scenario is that the off-season baseline of around 29-30 destinations is augmented by 1-2 new year-round routes and 1-2 seasonal routes, pushing the total comfortably above 31. \n\nThe main downside risk, as correctly identified by Forecaster 3, is regional instability leading to the suspension of a few routes (e.g., to Iran or the Levant), which could counteract the gains. This risk prevents me from going higher. However, the strong positive momentum and the high likelihood of seasonal additions now make a 'Yes' outcome appear much more probable than not. I am therefore increasing my forecast from 40% to 70%.",
