  "information": "In March 2025, Anthropic raised approximately $3.5 billion in a funding round that valued the company at around $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion a year prior. Key investors in this and other recent rounds include Amazon (access to $8 billion), Google (over $3 billion invested), Lightspeed Venture Partners, Salesforce Ventures, and Fidelity Management & Research Co. Analysts have noted that the company's access to deep private funding from strategic partners lowers its immediate need for capital.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Anthropic remains a privately held company and does not announce plans for an IPO.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic's leadership decides that its recent, substantial private funding rounds provide more than enough capital for its short-to-medium term operational and research needs. They prefer to avoid the regulatory scrutiny, quarterly earnings pressure, and market volatility associated with being a public company, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an S-1 filing or official announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by a desire to capitalize on a favorable market window for AI stocks and provide liquidity for early investors and employees, Anthropic's board accelerates its IPO timeline. The company either files a Form S-1 with the SEC or makes a formal announcement on its corporate news page before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily favors the status quo, which is that Anthropic will remain a private company in the short term. The primary evidence supporting this is the massive influx of private capital mentioned in the research report, including a recent $3.5 billion round in March 2025 and access to billions more from strategic partners like Amazon and Google. This level of funding significantly reduces any immediate financial pressure to tap the public markets. An IPO is a lengthy, complex process, and with only six weeks until the deadline, announcing one now would seem rushed unless preparations have been underway secretly for a long time. The current focus for a company like Anthropic is likely on scaling its technology and competing in the rapidly evolving AI landscape, a goal often better served by the flexibility of private ownership.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 5% because the AI market is extremely volatile and subject to rapid strategic shifts. A competitor's move, unexpected market enthusiasm, or intense pressure from non-strategic investors could force an accelerated timeline. A confidential S-1 filing could already be in process.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 5% because the evidence against a near-term IPO is compelling. The company is flush with cash from strategic partners who likely prefer the stability and long-term alignment of a private partnership over the short-term pressures of the public market. The short timeframe makes a formal announcement highly improbable.\n\nI would increase my probability if credible financial news outlets reported that an S-1 filing was imminent. I would decrease it further if Anthropic's leadership made public statements ruling out an IPO in 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn March 2025, Anthropic raised approximately $3.5 billion in a funding round that valued the company at around $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion a year prior. Key investors in this and other recent rounds include Amazon (access to $8 billion), Google (over $3 billion invested), Lightspeed Venture Partners, Salesforce Ventures, and Fidelity Management & Research Co. Analysts have noted that the company's access to deep private funding from strategic partners lowers its immediate need for capital.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
