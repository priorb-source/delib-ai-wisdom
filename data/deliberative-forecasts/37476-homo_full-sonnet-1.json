    "review": "All three forecasters arrived independently at 10%, which strengthens confidence in this estimate. The consensus reasoning is sound: positive net cash position ($152M), no debt maturity before July 1, and the critically short 53-day timeframe make bankruptcy filing unlikely. Forecaster 2's base rate argument is particularly compelling - even severely distressed public companies rarely file bankruptcy within any given 2-month period. Forecaster 3's mention of potential covenant violations and supplier pressure as early warning indicators is valuable, though we have no evidence these issues exist yet. The most important new insight is the emphasis on process time: bankruptcy filings require board deliberation, legal preparation, and typically attempts at alternatives first, which generally takes weeks even in crisis situations. However, I note that all forecasters, including myself, flagged the same critical concern: the current ratio of 0.5 indicates current liabilities roughly double current assets. If current assets are mostly the $283M cash, this implies ~$566M in current liabilities - a severe working capital crunch that could create unexpected pressure. The May 12 earnings report (3 days away) remains a critical catalyst that could reveal accelerating cash burn or creditor/supplier issues we don't yet know about.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I remain convinced that 10% is appropriate. The short 53-day timeframe is the dominant factor. Even if GoPro's situation deteriorates on May 12, the company would likely exhaust alternatives (emergency financing, asset sales, creditor negotiations) before filing bankruptcy, and this process typically requires more than the remaining ~50 days after that date. The positive net cash position provides genuine runway, and the November 2025 debt maturity means no immediate forced action. The severe distress signals (0.5 current ratio, $432M loss, 20% revenue decline, $91M market cap) explain why the probability isn't lower, but the process constraints and timeframe explain why it isn't higher. The base rate consideration strengthens this view - bankruptcy filings by public companies within any specific 2-month window are rare events. I would update upward only with evidence of acute liquidity crisis, failed financing attempts, or catastrophic May 12 results showing accelerating burn. I would update downward with successful capital raises or better-than-expected earnings.",
