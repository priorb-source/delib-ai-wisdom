  "information": "According to multiple news reports from late May 2025, former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo is considered disqualified from the 2025 presidential election. This is due to a 2018 conviction for the looting of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), which resulted in a 20-year prison sentence and the loss of his civic rights. Sources such as Le Point, tunisienumerique.com, and Abidjan.net state that he remains struck from the electoral list. His political party, the People's African Party-Côte d'Ivoire (PPA-CI), announced in late April 2025 that it would evaluate the situation in the first half of June 2025 and consider a 'new level in the fight' if his status on the electoral list does not change.\n\nThe political climate in Côte d'Ivoire is marked by the disqualification of several opposition figures ahead of the October 2025 election. In April 2025, Tidjane Thiam, leader of the main opposition party PDCI-RDA, was disqualified after a court ruled he did not meet eligibility conditions due to his prior dual French-Ivorian nationality, despite having renounced his French citizenship. This and other exclusions have led to protests and accusations of electoral manipulation. Reports also mention that other political figures like Charles Blé Goudé and Guillaume Soro have been excluded from the electoral process due to judicial convictions. In response to the political tensions, various groups, including religious leaders and the UN, have called for peaceful dialogue.\n\nSeveral of the candidates named in the question have officially announced their intention to run in the 2025 presidential election. Jean-Louis Billon, a member of the PDCI-RDA party, announced his candidacy in late May 2025, positioning himself as an alternative within his party following the disqualification of its leader, Tidjane Thiam. Simone Gbagbo, former first lady, has also announced her candidacy under the banner of her party, the Movement of Capable Generations (MGC). Pascal Affi N'Guessan is also presented as a candidate for the FPI party.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month until July 1, 2025 (today is May 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Laurent Gbagbo appears to already be disqualified",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "All five named candidates (Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, and Simone Gbagbo) remain eligible or successfully appeal any disqualifications, staying on the electoral list through July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current disqualification status of Laurent Gbagbo is confirmed and officially maintained through July 1, 2025, or any of the other four candidates becomes disqualified through legal proceedings, court rulings, or electoral commission decisions.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report indicates that Laurent Gbagbo is already considered disqualified from the 2025 presidential election as of late May 2025. Multiple sources (Le Point, tunisienumerique.com, and Abidjan.net) state he has been struck from the electoral list due to a 2018 conviction for looting the Central Bank of West African States, which resulted in a 20-year prison sentence and loss of civic rights. This suggests the question may have already effectively resolved as Yes. However, there is some uncertainty because Gbagbo's political party (PPA-CI) announced plans to evaluate the situation in the first half of June 2025 and consider escalating their response, suggesting potential legal appeals or challenges may be ongoing. The other four candidates (Jean-Louis Billon, Simone Gbagbo, and Pascal Affi N'Guessan) have announced their candidacies with no reported disqualifications, though no information is available about Gnangbo Kacou. Given the volatile political climate - with Tidjane Thiam recently disqualified in April 2025 and other opposition figures excluded - there remains a possibility that additional candidates could be disqualified before July 1. My forecast is not higher (95-100%) because there's uncertainty about whether Gbagbo's disqualification is absolutely final or could be reversed through appeals, and because the exact legal status requires confirmation from official sources. My forecast is not lower because multiple credible sources report an existing disqualification based on a clear legal basis from 2018, making the status quo strongly favor a Yes outcome.",
