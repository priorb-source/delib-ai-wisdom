    "review": "The analyses from all three forecasters are in strong alignment on the core thesis. We all identified the same critical pieces of evidence pointing towards a 'No' outcome: 1) Rippling CEO Parker Conrad's direct and very recent statements disavowing any imminent IPO plans, 2) the massive $450 million Series G funding round in May 2025, which reduces the need for public capital, and 3) the company's commitment to secondary liquidity programs, which reduces internal pressure to go public. We also all acknowledged the same low-probability counterarguments, namely that CEO statements can be strategic and that the 'thawing' IPO market could change rapidly. The other forecasters did not raise any new evidence I had not considered. Their reasoning is highly convincing as it mirrors my own. The only point of divergence is the final probability, with both other forecasters at 5% and me initially at 3%. This minor difference reflects a subjective judgment on the small chance of an unexpected event.",
    "rationale": "My core rationale remains unchanged. The combination of direct C-level statements, recent corporate financial actions (a large private funding round), and the establishment of alternative liquidity mechanisms creates an overwhelming body of evidence against an IPO announcement in the next five weeks. The timeline is simply too short to reverse course and prepare a formal announcement or S-1 filing after such explicit denials. However, after reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am updating my forecast slightly upwards. Both other forecasters arrived at 5%, and this consensus suggests I may have been slightly overconfident in my initial 3% forecast. While no new evidence was presented, the convergence at 5% leads me to modestly increase the weight I assign to the tail risks we all identified: the possibility of CEO misdirection and a sudden, irresistible shift in the IPO market. This adjustment from 3% to 5% reflects a small concession to this shared uncertainty and brings my forecast into alignment with the group's consensus without altering my fundamental view that a 'Yes' outcome is extremely unlikely.",
