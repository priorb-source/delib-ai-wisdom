  "information": "It is standard corporate practice for companies to avoid rescheduling an annual meeting within a two-week period unless there is a significant reason. Meetings can sometimes be intentionally adjourned if a controversial proposal requires more time for proxy solicitation. GameStop has previously done this for a share-increase motion. The technical failure that affected GameStop's 2024 meeting is a known risk, though many other large-cap companies regularly hold virtual meetings without major incidents.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days (from May 27, 2025 to June 12, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the meeting takes place as scheduled",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The meeting experiences server crashes similar to 2024 and must be postponed before completion, or GameStop reschedules the meeting to allow additional time for proxy solicitation on a controversial proposal",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GameStop holds its annual meeting on June 12, 2025 as scheduled, with adequate server capacity to handle attendee volume, and the meeting proceeds through completion without technical difficulties or need for adjournment",
    "rationale": "With only 16 days until June 12, the meeting date should already be publicly announced and scheduled if this is indeed the planned date. Corporate annual meetings are typically announced months in advance through SEC filings and investor relations communications. The base rate strongly favors meetings occurring as scheduled - companies avoid rescheduling within two weeks absent significant reasons. However, several factors create meaningful downside risk: (1) GameStop's 2024 meeting experienced severe server crashes from overwhelming interest, establishing a precedent for technical failure; (2) The resolution criteria specifically require full completion, not just commencement, making technical disruptions fatal to a Yes outcome; (3) GameStop has historically adjourned meetings for controversial proposals requiring additional proxy solicitation time. The key uncertainty is whether June 12 is definitively the scheduled date - I lack explicit confirmation from GameStop's investor relations or SEC filings. If it is the scheduled date, probability would be 85-90% given normal corporate inertia. However, accounting for GameStop's technical difficulties (5-10% risk), potential intentional postponement (3-5% risk), and uncertainty about whether this is actually the confirmed date (10-15% risk), I arrive at a lower forecast. To update higher, I would need: confirmation June 12 is the official scheduled date, evidence of improved technical infrastructure, or statements from GameStop about preparedness. To update lower: announcement of a different date, indications of controversial proxy items requiring more time, or early technical problems in registration systems.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Gamestop annual meeting take place on June 12, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNBC (2024): [Servers for GameStop annual shareholder meeting crash due to overwhelming interest](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/gamestop-annual-shareholder-meeting-2024-servers-crash.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Gamestop's 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is held on June 12, 2025.\n\nThe meeting is considered to have been held when it fully completed. For example, if the meeting begins but is then postponed due to server issues, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIt is standard corporate practice for companies to avoid rescheduling an annual meeting within a two-week period unless there is a significant reason. Meetings can sometimes be intentionally adjourned if a controversial proposal requires more time for proxy solicitation. GameStop has previously done this for a share-increase motion. The technical failure that affected GameStop's 2024 meeting is a known risk, though many other large-cap companies regularly hold virtual meetings without major incidents.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
