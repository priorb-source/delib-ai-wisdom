  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 36-37 days until the summit begins on July 6-7, 2025, with resolution occurring at 00:00 on July 8, 2025 (Rio de Janeiro time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No invitation issued. The current trajectory indicates no new countries will be invited to full BRICS membership at the 17th Summit",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Brazil maintains its stated position that BRICS should stabilize before expanding further. The summit proceeds with its drafted agenda focusing on financial architecture reforms and development funds, with only non-committal language on enlargement. Internal disagreements among existing members prevent the unanimous consensus required for new invitations. The summit concludes without any formal invitations to full membership being extended",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite Brazil's initial reluctance, BRICS members reach last-minute consensus to elevate one or more partner countries (such as Malaysia, Thailand, Belarus, or Nigeria) to full membership status. Alternatively, intense diplomatic negotiations in the weeks leading to the summit result in unanimous agreement to invite an entirely new country not previously invited, possibly through a compromise package deal",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors NO for several compelling reasons. First, Brazil as the host nation has explicitly stated through presidential adviser Celso Amorim that BRICS 'should stabilise where it is' before admitting more members. This is a clear policy signal from the summit host. Second, official draft agendas circulated in late April 2025 prioritize financial reforms and contain only 'non-committal language' regarding enlargement, suggesting expansion is not a priority item. Third, the April 2025 foreign ministers' meeting failed to reach agreement on even a joint communiqué, indicating significant internal discord that makes unanimous consent for new members highly unlikely. Fourth, the structural requirement for unanimous agreement among all existing members creates a high bar that is difficult to clear when the bloc shows signs of disagreement. Fifth, with only 5-6 weeks remaining until the summit, there is limited time for the intensive consensus-building and diplomatic negotiations typically required for membership decisions. Kazakhstan's recent public ruling out of full membership further suggests that even interested countries are hesitant about the current state of BRICS. The partner country framework introduced at the 16th Summit appears designed specifically to engage interested countries without committing to full membership expansion. While partner countries could theoretically be elevated to full membership, Brazil's stabilization stance makes this unlikely in the immediate term. BRICS has surprised observers before - the August 2023 expansion announcement was significant - but that followed a longer period of discussion and came with more positive signals. The current environment shows no such indicators. What would increase my forecast: concrete reports of consensus-building meetings on specific membership candidates, public statements from multiple BRICS members supporting expansion, or leaked documents showing expansion on the actual summit agenda. What would decrease my forecast: additional explicit statements against expansion from other member states, or confirmed final agendas with no expansion provisions. I'm not forecasting 0% because political summits can produce surprises, and there's always a small possibility that behind-the-scenes negotiations could lead to unexpected outcomes. However, the weight of evidence - particularly Brazil's clear position, the need for unanimity, and the short timeframe - strongly suggests no new invitations will be issued. I estimate the probability at approximately 12%",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a new country be invited to BRICS at the 17th BRICS Summit?\n\nQuestion background:\n[BRICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS) is an intergovernmental organization originally founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which held their first formal summit in 2009. South Africa was invited to join in 2010, completing the original five-member grouping. BRICS serves as a forum for cooperation among major emerging economies, with a focus on economic development, political coordination, and reform of international institutions.\n\nAt the [15th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_BRICS_summit) in August 2023, the group announced a major expansion. Full membership invitations were extended to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Argentina later declined the invitation, while Saudi Arabia has not formally accepted. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE officially joined on January 1, 2024.&#x20;\n\nAt the [16th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_BRICS_summit) in October 2024, held in Kazan, Russia, BRICS formally introduced a new partner country framework. Thirteen countries were invited as partners at the 16th Summit: Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed participation. Indonesia later joined as a full member on January 6, 2025.\n\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled to take place on July 6–7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many countries have formally expressed interest in joining BRICS, but new members can only be admitted with unanimous agreement from existing members. While expansion remains a stated goal of the bloc, no new invitations have been confirmed.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if at least one previously not invited country is invited to join BRICS as a full member during or before the 17th BRICS summit.\n\nThis question will only resolve based upon an invitation for full membership, not partner status or any other status in the organisation.\n\n* An invitation of a partner country to become a full member will resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* Reinvitation of Saudi Arabia or Argentina will not be sufficient to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Whether or not a country accepts its invitation will have no impact on this question.\n* If the 17th BRICS summit is delayed, that will not impact this question unless the delay is to after August 31, 2025, in which case this question will be annulled.\n* The specific cutoff for resolution will be 00:00 following the final day of the summit. For example, if the summit is held as expected on July 6-7, the cutoff will be July 8, 00:00. This question will use the timezone of the summit's location, if the summit has no physical location, it will use UTC.\n* For the purposes of this question, \"country\" is defined as a UN member state.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled for July 6-7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro.
