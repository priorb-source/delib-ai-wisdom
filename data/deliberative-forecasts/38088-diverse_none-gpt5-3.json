    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize two anchors I largely share: (1) the most recent observation at #250 is non-U.S., and (2) Americans have the largest cohort on the list, so the base rate near the median is materially >30%. Forecaster 3 adds a useful point about smaller wealth gaps mid-list and 5–10% net-worth swings over a month, reinforcing that churn around #250 is meaningful. One correction to my own earlier thinking prompted by Forecaster 2: if U.S. markets outperform globally, that likely increases the cross-sectional share of Americans at a given rank, including around #250, rather than decreasing it. I don’t see new concrete data beyond April 30, so the updates here are conceptual rather than evidentiary.",
    "rationale": "Short horizon (~33 days) and typical mid-rank volatility imply the July 1 outcome will approximate the local nationality mix rather than be tightly anchored to a single April 30 snapshot. The U.S. share near rank ~250 plausibly sits in the mid-to-high 30s, and day-to-day churn makes a U.S. occupant by July 1 fairly plausible. However, the most recent point we have is a non-U.S. (Italy) at #250, which nudges the odds slightly below an even split. I’m removing my earlier argument that U.S. outperformance would lower the chance—if anything, broad U.S. outperformance would raise the probability of an American at #250—but I don’t have evidence it will materialize specifically into late June. Netting these, I modestly trim my estimate to better reflect a base-rate-plus-status-quo view while acknowledging high churn.",
