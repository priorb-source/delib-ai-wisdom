    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly between 33-38%, suggesting strong consensus on the key evidence. We all anchor on the historical 35-40% rate for advance estimates in the -0.5% to 0% range turning positive. However, I notice Forecaster 3 made a calculation error (stating we need 0.3 pp rather than >0.2 pp from -0.2%), though their forecast seems reasonable regardless. Forecaster 2 emphasizes 'upward revision momentum' more strongly than I did, which is an interesting framing - though one upward revision of 0.1 pp may not constitute strong momentum. A key tension emerges: the 35-40% historical figure applies to advance-to-third estimate changes, but we're now at the second estimate. The question is whether remaining revisions (second-to-third) show similar patterns, given that the second estimate already incorporated additional data. Both forecasters make valid points about being very close to the threshold, but this cuts both ways - if the true figure were positive, wouldn't the second estimate have captured it? That said, I may have been overly conservative in my status quo bias.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my initial 33% was slightly too conservative. The historical 35-40% figure for this specific range is strong empirical evidence that I should weight more heavily. While I correctly noted that the second estimate already incorporated new data, the third estimate will still include complete March data on trade, construction, and inventories, plus annual benchmark revisions that could plausibly add the needed 0.2+ percentage points. However, I maintain reservations about going as high as 38% because: (1) typical second-to-third revisions are 0.1-0.2 pp in absolute terms, and we need the upper end or better, (2) we've already had one upward revision, suggesting the most obvious positive adjustments may have been captured, and (3) consecutive large upward revisions remain uncommon. The clustering of all three forecasts in the 33-38% range validates that we're interpreting similar evidence. I'm updating modestly upward to better align with the historical base rate while maintaining appropriate caution about the second estimate having already captured significant adjustments.",
