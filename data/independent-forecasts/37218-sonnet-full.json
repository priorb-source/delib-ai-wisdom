  "information": "Donald Trump has a history of attending UFC events in the United States, typically appearing at 2 to 4 cards per year since 2019. All of his previous appearances have been at domestic events. He has a strong personal relationship with UFC President Dana White. Trump recently attended a UFC event in Miami in April 2025. Historically, he has not attended two consecutive numbered UFC cards within a one-month span; UFC 315 is scheduled to take place four weeks after the Miami event.\n\nUFC 315 is scheduled for May 10, 2025, at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The event's fight card includes two title fights, with a welterweight championship bout between Belal Muhammad and Jack Della Maddalena as one of the main events. No sitting or former U.S. president has previously attended a UFC event held in Canada or any other foreign country.\n\nJoe Rogan, a prominent UFC commentator, has publicly announced he will not be attending UFC 315 in Montreal. He cited his discontent with the Canadian government as the reason, stating he 'doesn't go to Canada anymore' and would 'rather go to Russia.' Rogan also mentioned that he had discussed US-Canada relations with Donald Trump, who had joked about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "12 days - the outcome will be known on May 10, 2025 when UFC 315 takes place",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Trump does not attend UFC 315 in Montreal",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump remains in the United States and does not travel to Montreal for UFC 315, consistent with his established pattern of only attending domestic UFC events and not attending consecutive numbered cards within a one-month period",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump makes an unprecedented international trip to attend UFC 315 in Montreal, breaking his historical pattern of exclusively attending domestic UFC events despite having just attended an event in Miami four weeks prior",
    "rationale": "The status quo heavily favors a No outcome based on multiple converging factors. First, the historical precedent is definitive: no sitting or former US president has ever attended a UFC event outside the United States, and all of Trump's previous UFC appearances have been domestic. Second, the timing works against attendance - Trump just attended UFC in Miami in early April 2025, and he historically does not attend consecutive numbered UFC cards within a one-month span. Third, the international location in Canada adds logistical complexity, security considerations, and potential political optics issues given Trump's contentious relationship with PM Trudeau. Fourth, Joe Rogan's explicit refusal to attend UFC 315 due to issues with the Canadian government provides a revealing data point - if even a prominent commentator is avoiding Canada for political reasons, this suggests the climate may not be conducive to a Trump visit. While Trump does have a strong relationship with Dana White and typically attends 2-4 UFC events annually, he has already fulfilled part of that quota with Miami. The two title fights might be appealing, but not enough to overcome the unprecedented nature of international attendance. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of Trump planning to be in Canada anyway, specific reports of attendance plans, or a dramatic shift in his international travel patterns. For it to move lower, I would need confirmation of conflicting schedules or explicit statements ruling out attendance. The overwhelming weight of historical precedent and pattern consistency suggests approximately 5% probability.",
