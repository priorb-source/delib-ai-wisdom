    "review": "Both analyses are well-reasoned and largely align with my priors: without an announced joint session, the base rate is No; interpersonal friction and security/logistics reduce odds; a brief orchestrated moment could still resolve Yes; Musk’s attendance volatility is a key risk. Forecaster 2 adds the “overshadowing risk” for YC, which further discourages a joint setup; Forecaster 3 emphasizes the 2024 lawsuit context and the possibility of an all‑speakers segment as a tail path to Yes. These are incremental, not transformative, updates. I don’t see compelling new evidence to raise or lower materially: the lack of any public hint of a joint session ~20 days out still weighs against; the recruiting upside for Musk at a student-heavy event sustains attendance likelihood but doesn’t meaningfully increase joint-stage odds without explicit planning.",
    "rationale": "Time until event: ~20 days. Status quo absent an explicit agenda: separate appearances. My structure: P(both in-person) remains high but not certain (Altman ~0.9–0.95; Musk ~0.7–0.8 given recruiting upside but known volatility), yielding ~0.65–0.75. Conditional on both being there, P(joint stage) still looks modest (~0.15–0.25) given strained relations, security/PR concerns, and no announcement so close to the event. Even allowing for a brief symbolic joint moment (opening/closing), organizers would typically pre-plan and often pre-signal a marquee pairing; the absence of such signals pushes me away from the upper end of that conditional. Countervailing tail: YC could engineer a surprise shared moment, but that also risks overshadowing the program, supporting the default of separate slots. Net: these deliberation points confirm rather than shift my view. I’m holding my estimate steady pending concrete scheduling info. Upward movers: official agenda or credible hints of a joint panel; reports of an all‑speakers on‑stage segment. Downward movers: published schedule with strictly separate formats/times, any indication of remote/cancellation by either, or renewed public friction.",
