    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 rightly emphasize unusually strong, public political opposition (President/union/bipartisan) and the unusually long pendency, both of which raise the odds of a decisive outcome. The main new point I take from them is the weight they place on duration (~17 months) implying an imminent decision point. However, I don’t find their probabilities fully persuasive for this question’s narrow resolution: it requires an 8-K termination filing before July 1, not just de facto doom. Deals often persist via extensions or mitigation talks, especially with an ally-country acquirer, and formal prohibitions are rare and unpredictable on timing. Neither forecaster addresses the filing mechanic: even if an outside-date lapse or decision occurs right at end-June, the 8-K might post after July 1, which matters for resolution. Their analyses strengthen the case for some upward adjustment, but they seem to overweight politics relative to timing and procedural inertia.",
    "rationale": "Key drivers remain: (1) short window (~6 weeks) and the need for a same-period 8-K filing; (2) strong incentives to extend rather than terminate; (3) mitigation/extension as the modal outcome in sensitive ally-country deals; (4) tail risk of a swift CFIUS/Presidential block or a deliberate decision not to extend. I modestly raise my estimate based on the long pendency and continued high-level opposition, plus the possibility the merger agreement’s outside date may be near end-June, creating a natural decision point. That said, even if an outside date is June 30, the most common path is mutual extension; and even if not, an 8-K might not be filed before July 1. On balance, No remains more likely due to timing mechanics and deal inertia, but Yes is a meaningful tail.",
