  "information": "The United States recently implemented a general 10% tariff on imports from most trading partners. Concurrently, the administration has pursued other trade actions, including imposing a 25% tariff on imported automobiles and certain auto parts, and increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to over 100% in response to retaliatory measures. Additionally, new tariffs ranging from 41% to over 3,500% have been announced on solar imports from several Southeast Asian countries, pending a final decision in June 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 38 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Israel is likely currently subject to the general 10% tariff rate recently implemented by the US, not 17%",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The tariff rate on Israeli imports remains at the current level (likely 10%) or changes to a rate other than 17%. No new tariff adjustments are made specific to Israel, or the administration reduces/eliminates tariffs on Israel as a close ally.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The US administration increases the tariff on Israeli goods from the current 10% to exactly 17% through executive action before June 1, 2025. This could occur as part of broader trade renegotiations or as a specific adjustment to Israel's tariff treatment.",
    "rationale": "The research indicates the US recently implemented a general 10% tariff on most trading partners, which likely includes Israel given the Times of Israel article about impacts on Israeli exports. For the outcome to be Yes, the tariff would need to increase from 10% to exactly 17% within approximately 5-6 weeks.\n\nSeveral factors make this unlikely: First, the timeframe is very short for such a specific policy change. Second, Israel is a close strategic ally of the United States, making targeted tariff increases less probable compared to adversarial nations. Third, the specific 17% figure is unusual - the administration has used round numbers like 10%, 25%, and 100% in other cases. Fourth, there's no indication in the research of any planned changes to Israel's tariff status specifically.\n\nThe volatile trade environment and active tariff policy adjustments prevent me from assigning an extremely low probability. The administration has shown willingness to rapidly adjust tariffs (as seen with China, autos, and solar products). However, the arbitrary 17% figure and lack of any specific momentum toward this outcome are significant.\n\nMy forecast would be higher if there were: reports of US-Israel trade tensions, leaked plans for Israel-specific tariff changes, or a pattern of 17% tariffs being applied elsewhere. My forecast would be lower if the timeframe were longer or if there were explicit commitments to maintain current rates with Israel.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Israel as 17% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of Israel: [Israeli exports to US will take annual $2.3B hit under tariffs, industrial org warns](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-exports-to-us-will-take-2-3-billion-hit-under-tariffs-industrialist-org-warns/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 17% for Israel at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=israel) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe United States recently implemented a general 10% tariff on imports from most trading partners. Concurrently, the administration has pursued other trade actions, including imposing a 25% tariff on imported automobiles and certain auto parts, and increasing tariffs on Chinese goods to over 100% in response to retaliatory measures.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
