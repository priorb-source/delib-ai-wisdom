    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days - 10 days until June 2025 begins, plus 30 days of June, plus verification on or after July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NUFORC continues receiving and posting UFO reports at historical rates, with cube-shaped sightings occurring occasionally but rarely",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes without NUFORC receiving or posting any reports of cube-shaped UFO sightings, either because no such sightings are reported to them, witnesses describe different shapes, or reports don't meet posting criteria",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one witness reports a cube-shaped UFO sighting from June 2025 to NUFORC, and the Center posts this report on their website before Metaculus checks on or after July 1, 2025, similar to the pattern seen in December 2024",
    "rationale": "The key baseline data point is that December 2024 had 6 cube-shaped UFO sightings reported to NUFORC, which is explicitly described as rare in their history. This establishes that: (1) cube-shaped UFO reports do occur and get posted, (2) they are uncommon enough to be noteworthy, and (3) even rare events can cluster in particular months. With NUFORC having processed 180,000+ reports over 50 years (roughly 3,600/year or 300/month average), cube shapes represent a small fraction. However, the question only requires ONE cube-shaped report in June 2025, not six. This significantly increases the probability compared to asking if we'd see multiple reports. The recent December 2024 data suggests these reports haven't disappeared entirely. Conservative reasoning: if December's 6 reports was unusually high and the typical rate is closer to 1-3 per month for cube shapes, we'd still expect a reasonable chance of at least one in June. My forecast is not higher (e.g., 85%+) because 'rare' suggests many months might have zero cube reports, and December could have been a statistical outlier. My forecast is not lower (e.g., 30%) because we have concrete recent evidence that cube reports do occur, they get posted, and we only need one report to resolve Yes. I would update higher with evidence that cube reports continued in early 2025, or data showing December wasn't anomalous. I would update lower if data showed most months have zero cube reports.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the National UFO Reporting Center report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a report of a sighting of a UFO/UAP shaped like a cube in June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nFor example, although rare in the history of NUFORC, the month of December 2024 [had](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202412) six sightings with a cube shape.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
