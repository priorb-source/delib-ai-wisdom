    "review": "Both forecasters align with my core framing: short time window favors No unless there’s an acute trigger. The added nuance I find most useful is Forecaster 2’s point about AQB historically relying more on equity than secured debt, which typically lowers immediate filing pressure because there’s less risk of a lender acceleration forcing a quick Chapter 11. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on typical pre-filing signals (defaults/accelerations, retention of restructuring advisors, abrupt shutdowns) also matches my lens; the absence of those in the prompt supports a sub-25% stance. I don’t see materially new hard information, but their arguments modestly reinforce my prior view rather than contradict it.",
    "rationale": "Given ~8 weeks left and no cited acute catalysts (defaults, failed financing 8-K, advisor retention, or a disclosed cash-out date before July 1), I still weight the status quo toward No. The equity-heavy financing history slightly reduces near-term filing pressure versus a highly levered peer. Countervailing factors remain: persistent losses, microcap fundraising challenges, and the possibility of a sudden liquidity shortfall. Netting these, I maintain a modest but nontrivial probability. No change from 23%: the others’ analyses are consistent with mine and don’t introduce new concrete red flags or de-risking events that would justify a shift.",
