  "information": "In Africa, a coup attempt in Burkina Faso was reportedly foiled on April 16, 2025, leading to the arrest of several army officers. This follows a January 2025 attack on the presidential palace in Chad, which was also viewed as a potential coup attempt. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has expressed concern over a wave of unconstitutional changes in West Africa, noting that between August 2020 and August 2024, the region experienced nine coup attempts, four of which were successful. Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso have withdrawn from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to form their own 'Sahel Alliance.' According to a report by Amnesty International, since the July 2023 coup in Niger, there has been a sharp escalation of human rights violations, including arbitrary detentions and violations of press freedom.\n\nAccording to the University of Illinois Cline Center’s Coup d'État Project, the number of coups, attempts, and conspiracies has risen since 2021 to 14-16 events per year, compared to single-digit figures in the 2000s and 2010s. However, these figures remain below the averages of the 1960s and 1970s. The number of successful coups was seven in 2021 and five in 2024. A summary of historical data from the reports indicates that from 2020 to early 2025, Africa experienced nine notable coup events, of which seven were successful. Over a similar period, from 2022 to 2024, Latin America had three notable coup events, all of which were unsuccessful.\n\nIn Latin America, the Venezuelan government has offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of opposition leader Edmundo González, accusing him of inciting a coup following a disputed election in 2024. In Brazil, former President Jair Bolsonaro is reportedly preparing to present legal arguments to defend himself against accusations of leading a coup plot. The World Bank has revised its economic growth projections for Latin America downward to 2.1% for 2025. According to the agents' analysis, there have been no reported coup attempts in Latin America so far in 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No successful coup occurs in Africa or Latin America before the deadline. Regional instability and political tensions persist, and there may be unsuccessful coup attempts, but no government is successfully overthrown by its military or other state elites.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing political instability in regions like the Sahel and tensions in countries like Venezuela, no group of military or state elites manages to successfully seize control of a government. Any coup attempts that do occur are thwarted by loyalist security forces, similar to the recent failed attempts in Burkina Faso (April 2025) and Bolivia (June 2024).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A military faction in a politically unstable African nation, such as Chad or another country in the Sahel region, successfully overthrows the sitting government. The junta consolidates control over the capital and the military apparatus, faces no significant internal resistance, and the event is widely reported by credible media as a successful coup.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on an analysis of the base rate of successful coups in the specified regions, adjusted for the very short timeframe and current geopolitical conditions. The provided data indicates approximately 7 successful coups in Africa between 2020 and early 2025, an average of about 1.4 per year. For the remaining 2.2-month period until July 1, 2025, this base rate suggests a probability of roughly 25%. I am adjusting this slightly downward to 20%. The risk is almost entirely concentrated in Africa, particularly the Sahel region, which has seen a 'coup contagion' effect. Latin America's contribution to this probability is minimal, given its recent history of failed attempts. My forecast is not higher because the timeframe is extremely short. Coups are rare events, and a period of just over two months is more likely than not to pass without a successful one. Additionally, recent failed attempts in Burkina Faso (April 2025) and Chad (January 2025) demonstrate that governments and security forces in the region are on high alert and capable of thwarting plots, which may have a temporary deterrent effect. My forecast is not lower because the underlying conditions that fuel coups—political instability, economic hardship, and regional precedent—remain potent. The data from the Cline Center clearly shows a significant increase in coup activity since 2021, making the current era more volatile than the previous two decades. A probability below this level would understate the very real risk present in several fragile states. I would raise my forecast given credible intelligence of major military purges or mutinies in a vulnerable country. I would lower it if a major potential flashpoint, such as a contentious election, is peacefully resolved.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to [Powell & Thyne (2011, p. 252)](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf), a coup is \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\" In recent years, some of the coups in Africa have been:&#x20;\n\n* [Mali August 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Mali May 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Niger March 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Nigerien_coup_attempt) (attempt)\n* [Niger July 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nigerien_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Gabon August 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Gabonese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Chad January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%27Djamena_attack) (possible attempt)\n* [Burkina Faso January 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Burkina Faso September 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)&#x20;\n* [Guinea September 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n\nLatin America has had the following coup attempts in recent years:\n\n* [Peru self-coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Peruvian_self-coup_attempt), December 2022\n* [Brazil Congress attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack), January 2023\n* [Bolivia coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bolivian_coup_attempt), June 2024\n\nSee also: [VoA by the numbers Coups in Africa](https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is a successful coup d’état in any country on the African continent or Latin America before July 1, 2025, according to credible media reports.

This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Africa, a coup attempt in Burkina Faso was reportedly foiled on April 16, 2025, leading to the arrest of several army officers.
