    "review": "The other two forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus, with all three of us arriving at very low probabilities (2-3%) for the same core reasons. We all identified the extremely short timeframe, Anthropic's ample private funding (reducing the need for an IPO), and the complete lack of any public preparatory signals (e.g., reports of hiring investment banks) as the primary drivers for a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 3's slightly higher forecast of 3% was justified by the volatility of the AI market and the fact that only an announcement is required. While these are valid points that support a non-zero probability, I believe my initial 2% forecast already accounts for these low-probability surprise scenarios. Their analyses did not introduce new evidence but rather reinforced the overwhelming strength of the case against an impending IPO announcement.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of the other forecasters, I am maintaining my original forecast. The deliberation process has strengthened my conviction in the 'No' outcome. The consensus is clear: the combination of a very short deadline of ~1.5 months, Anthropic's recent massive private funding rounds from strategic partners like Amazon and Google, and the total absence of public evidence of IPO preparations makes an announcement before July 1, 2025, extremely unlikely. An IPO process for a company of this scale is long and complex, and the typical precursors have not materialized. The arguments raised by my peers align perfectly with my initial reasoning. While I acknowledge the point about AI market volatility potentially causing a surprise strategic shift, this possibility is already captured in my 2% forecast, which is designed to account for such low-probability, high-impact events. No new information or compelling counterarguments were presented to justify an update.",
