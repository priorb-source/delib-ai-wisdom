  "information": "As of early May 2025, Muqtada al-Sadr has publicly and repeatedly reaffirmed his boycott of the 2025 Iraqi parliamentary election. In April 2025, he rejected a plea from the Iraqi President to reconsider his decision, stating he would not participate with 'the corrupt'. In March 2025, he forbade his followers from voting or participating in the election. A Qatari report from late April indicated al-Sadr is unwilling to take responsibility for the political mistakes of the rival Shia Coordination Framework. During a speech on May 2, 2025, he told supporters to 'speak out if their speech benefits reform, and remain silent if silence benefits reform.'\n\nThe Iraqi government has set November 11, 2025, as the date for the parliamentary elections. The Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) announced that the registration period for political alliances would run from April 15 to May 4, 2025. The political landscape is marked by significant divisions within the Shia bloc. The Shiite Coordination Framework, a major coalition, plans to participate in the election with at least six separate lists, though they are in discussions to form a post-election coalition. The electoral law remains a point of contention among political blocs.\n\nMuqtada al-Sadr has a history of reversing decisions to boycott elections. He previously reversed boycotts in 2014 and 2021. The 2021 reversal occurred in mid-August, approximately two months before the election. Despite his current boycott, al-Sadr has urged his followers to update their voter registration records. Some political sources have discussed the possibility of al-Sadr participating indirectly through an independent list to maintain influence, a strategy he has used in the past. In June 2022, after his party won 73 seats in the 2021 election, he ordered his entire parliamentary bloc to resign.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Alliance Towards Reforms will not announce its participation in the 2025 election by the deadline, as Muqtada al-Sadr's current stated position is a firm boycott of the electoral process.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Muqtada al-Sadr maintains his public boycott of the election through the July 1, 2025 deadline. The May 4 deadline for registering political alliances passes without his party's inclusion, reinforcing his non-participation stance for the immediate future. He continues to use the boycott as leverage over his political rivals, potentially delaying any final decision until later in the summer, consistent with his past behavior.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following significant back-channel negotiations, Sadr receives major concessions from his rivals in the Shia Coordination Framework regarding the electoral law or key government posts. In a surprise move typical of his political style, he reverses his position and announces his movement's participation before July 1 to consolidate his base and prevent his rivals from dominating the next parliament.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on several key factors that strongly favor a 'No' outcome within the specified timeframe. Firstly, the status quo is a firm and recently reiterated boycott by Muqtada al-Sadr, who in April 2025 publicly rejected a plea from the Iraqi President to participate. Secondly, there is a critical logistical barrier: the registration period for political alliances ends on May 4, 2025. It is highly improbable that Sadr will reverse his long-held position with only one day's notice. Missing this deadline makes an announcement of participation as a formal alliance before July 1 procedurally difficult, though not impossible. Thirdly, Sadr's own history suggests that when he does reverse boycotts, he does so closer to the election to maximize political leverage. His 2021 reversal came in mid-August for an October election; a similar timeline would place any 2025 reversal after this question's July 1 deadline.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because Sadr is notoriously unpredictable and has a clear history of reversing such decisions (e.g., in 2014 and 2021). The fact that he has encouraged his followers to update their voter registration is a significant indicator that he is keeping the participation option open. A major political breakthrough or a shift in the balance of power could precipitate an early announcement.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 15% because the combination of Sadr's strong current rhetoric, the strategic logic of maintaining his outsider/reformer status for as long as possible, and the imminent registration deadline creates a high barrier to a 'Yes' outcome before July 1. The most likely scenario is that he maintains his boycott past the deadline, preserving his leverage.\n\nI would increase my forecast if the IHEC extends the alliance registration deadline or if credible reports emerge of high-stakes negotiations between Sadr and the Coordination Framework. I would decrease my forecast if the May 4 deadline passes and Sadr issues an even stronger statement explicitly ruling out participation.",
