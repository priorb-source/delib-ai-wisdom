  "information": "Kalshi, a prediction market platform regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has been actively offering daily MLB markets since April 17, 2025. Sports-related contracts represent a significant portion of its business, accounting for over 80% of weekend trading volume. The company has handled substantial trading activity, including $27 million for the Super Bowl and $500 million for the March Madness basketball tournament. Kalshi has also filed with the CFTC to expand its offerings to include single-game predictions.\n\nThe platform faces legal and regulatory challenges. A judge in Nevada is expected to rule quickly on a case involving Kalshi's prediction markets. Major sports leagues have voiced concerns; the NBA has cited 'substantial integrity risks' due to a perceived lack of regulatory oversight compared to traditional sportsbooks, and Major League Baseball has highlighted the need for consumer protections equivalent to state-level regulations. In response, Kalshi has announced plans to enhance user protections, including voluntary opt-outs, self-imposed trading breaks, and deposit caps.\n\nJune is part of the MLB regular season, during which games are scheduled on nearly every calendar day. The MLB All-Star Game is scheduled for July 2025. Other baseball-related events in late June include the Liga Mexicana de Béisbol (LMB) All-Star Game, set to take place from June 27 to 29, 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month. The question covers the period of June 2025. The outcome will be known on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Kalshi has consistently offered daily MLB markets since April 17, 2025. With sports betting forming a core part of its trading volume, the status quo is that this successful offering continues.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A judge in the pending Nevada case rules against Kalshi and issues an injunction, forcing an immediate halt to its sports markets. Alternatively, intense pressure from major sports leagues prompts the CFTC to take swift action, or a technical failure prevents Kalshi from listing markets on at least one day in June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Nevada court case is either resolved in Kalshi's favor, delayed past June, or any negative ruling is stayed pending appeal. The CFTC takes no action that would interrupt service. Kalshi continues its current operations, successfully listing MLB markets every day of the month without technical disruption.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong inertia of the current situation. Kalshi is actively offering these markets, and they constitute a significant portion of their business (over 80% of weekend volume), providing a powerful financial incentive to continue. They have demonstrated the operational capacity to do so since mid-April.\n\nThe primary risk is legal and regulatory. A judge's promise to 'move quickly' on the Nevada case introduces significant uncertainty. An adverse ruling or direct intervention by the CFTC, spurred by opposition from major sports leagues, could force a sudden stop. The resolution criterion is also strict: failure on even a single day in June for any reason, including a technical outage, results in a 'No' outcome.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 75% because the legal threat is specific, credible, and the timeline is short. The 'every day' requirement adds a layer of fragility. I would raise my forecast if the court case is delayed or resolved favorably for Kalshi.\n\nMy probability is not lower because legal and regulatory actions often move slower than anticipated, and their outcomes are uncertain. Kalshi has been operating under this scrutiny for some time, and the existing business momentum is a powerful force. I would lower my forecast significantly if an injunction is issued or if the CFTC signals imminent restrictive action.",
