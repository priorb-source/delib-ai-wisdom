    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the key constraint I underweighted: flightsfrom.com only counts filed scheduled services, not ad‑hoc charters, and we’re ~6 weeks from July 1—too little time for multiple new filings. They also stress that getting to six destinations requires several independent resumptions to be simultaneously visible in July schedules, which is a high bar for a small, demand‑constrained market like Palau. New points I hadn’t fully incorporated: (1) the likelihood that Yap may not be reliably scheduled (and thus may not appear), which removes an easy “extra” destination; (2) lingering PRC group‑tour restrictions dampening any Mainland China/Hong Kong restart; and (3) skepticism that the purported Brisbane service is operating and listed in July. I’m skeptical of Forecaster 2’s specific claim about a United Narita–Koror start in Oct 2025—it’s likely a misattribution and in any case irrelevant to July. But the broader arguments—short lead times, charters not counting, and multiple routes needing to align—are convincing and push me down.",
    "rationale": "To clear >5, ROR likely needs GUM and TPE plus at least four of: Yap (if scheduled), Manila (uncertain that it currently exists as a nonstop), Brisbane (uncertain and may not appear), a scheduled Korean service, and/or a Japan/Hong Kong service that’s truly filed as scheduled. With only weeks left and no widely reported filings, the base case is stability at ≤5, with downside risk if Yap isn’t listed or if Brisbane isn’t real/paused. Charters (e.g., JAL) likely won’t count on flightsfrom.com. PRC tour restrictions and soft Korean demand further reduce odds of multiple resumptions in sync. I still leave some upside for a summer Korean scheduled service and Brisbane both appearing, or another regional restart, but that requires at least two favorable surprises. Given these factors, I lower my probability materially.",
