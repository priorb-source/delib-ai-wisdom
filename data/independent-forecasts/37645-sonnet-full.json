  "information": "Student-led protests demanding the immediate dissolution of parliament and early elections have been ongoing in Serbia for over six months, originating from a tragic canopy collapse in Novi Sad in November 2024. Protestors threatened to escalate their actions if their demands were not met by mid-May. A survey conducted by the CRTA research center indicated that 59% of Serbian citizens support the students' actions. However, reports also suggest that the momentum of the protests has been waning and the political opposition remains fragmented.\n\nIn response to protests, government officials have maintained that there is no need for early elections. Vice-Premier Ivica Dačić stated that the ruling coalition has a 'stable majority' in parliament. Following the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, President Aleksandar Vučić announced that a decision would be made within ten days on whether to form a new government or hold elections. More recently, a May 14, 2025 article quoted Vučić saying the party would again decide 'within ten days' whether to form another new cabinet or go to the polls.\n\nFollowing the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, a constitutional deadline was triggered, requiring the formation of a new government to avoid a mandatory snap election. According to multiple wire-service reports from March and April 2025, a new government successfully won a confidence vote in the Serbian parliament in mid-April. This event removed the automatic, constitutionally-mandated trigger for snap elections before the summer.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement - the government continues with its current parliamentary majority",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ruling coalition maintains its stable majority. President Vučić and his party decide to continue with the current government that won confidence in mid-April 2025. Protests continue to wane, and no election announcement is made before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "President Vučić and the ruling party decide within their stated 'ten days' timeframe (from May 14) to call snap elections for strategic political reasons. They calculate that current conditions - fragmented opposition, solid polling position - favor early elections. An official announcement is made before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors NO. A new government was formed in mid-April 2025 and successfully won a confidence vote, removing the constitutional trigger for mandatory elections. Government officials maintain they have a stable majority and consistently state there's no need for early elections. The protests that began in November 2024 are reportedly losing momentum, and the opposition remains fragmented. However, President Vučić's May 14 statement about deciding 'within ten days' whether to form another cabinet or go to polls keeps the possibility alive. This represents a pattern of short-term decision windows he's mentioned previously. The fact that snap elections were recently considered (when the PM resigned in January) shows this remains a politically live option. Serbian politics has seen snap elections before when leaders calculate strategic advantage. With 59% public support for protesters' demands and fragmented opposition, there could be a rationale for the ruling party to call elections on their own terms. Why not higher (than 18%): The government literally just formed 4 weeks ago. There's no constitutional requirement. Officials have a consistent message against elections. Time is limited with only 47 days remaining. Why not lower: Vučić's very recent 'ten days' statement suggests active consideration. There's precedent for strategic snap elections. The option was seriously considered just months ago. For me to update higher: reports of coalition instability, Vučić statements leaning toward elections, or polling showing ruling party advantage in snap elections. For me to update lower: clear statements ruling out elections, the ten-day window passing with reaffirmation of current government, or further protest decline.",
