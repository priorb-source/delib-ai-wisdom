  "information": "The NATO summit is scheduled to take place from June 24 to June 26, 2025, at the World Forum in The Hague, Netherlands. This will be the first time the Netherlands has hosted a NATO summit. Over 6,000 delegates and 2,000 journalists from 32 NATO member countries and partner nations are expected to be in attendance. President Trump's schedule for June 2025 also includes other high-profile international travel, such as his attendance at the G7 leaders' summit in Kananaskis, Canada, from June 15 to 17.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks, with the summit scheduled for June 24-26, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The US President, as the de facto leader of the alliance, is expected to attend the annual NATO summit. This is a standard and highly important diplomatic engagement.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "President Trump makes a last-minute decision to skip the summit as a high-profile protest against what he perceives as insufficient defense spending by other NATO members, sending the Vice President or Secretary of State in his place.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "President Trump attends the summit as expected for a US head of state, using the opportunity as a global stage to directly pressure allies on policy and spending, and to engage in bilateral meetings.",
    "rationale": "The base rate for a sitting US President attending the annual NATO summit is very high, making 'Yes' the strong status quo outcome. The provided information that President Trump is scheduled to attend the G7 summit in Canada just a week prior (June 15-17) significantly reinforces this, indicating he is engaged in international summitry during this period and that logistical or general willingness to travel are not obstacles. The summit offers a powerful platform for President Trump to command global attention and directly negotiate with world leaders, which aligns with his political style. However, the probability is not higher due to his well-documented history of criticizing NATO, questioning its value, and his demonstrated willingness to break from traditional diplomatic norms. There is a non-trivial possibility he could cancel his attendance to make a political statement. The forecast is not lower because the institutional gravity of the summit is immense, and attending provides a more effective venue to exert pressure on allies than boycotting. I would increase my forecast if the White House releases a detailed schedule confirming his attendance. I would decrease it if there is a surge in anti-NATO rhetoric from the President or reports of a major diplomatic fallout with key allies in the immediate run-up to the event.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the NATO Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Netherlands to host 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_225618.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a NATO summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the NATO Summit such that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe NATO summit is scheduled to take place from June 24 to June 26, 2025, at the World Forum in The Hague, Netherlands.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
