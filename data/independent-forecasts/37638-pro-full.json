  "information": "The Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which aims to ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program. The bill, authored by Senator Charles Perry and supported by Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, passed the Senate on May 7, 2025, with a 25-6 vote and was sent to the House State Affairs Committee. Proponents cite concerns over public health and safety regarding unregulated high-THC products. Lt. Gov. Patrick has stated he will push for a special legislative session if a ban is not passed during the regular session. The proposed law would make possession of consumable hemp products punishable by up to one year in jail and a $4,000 fine.\n\nThe Texas House of Representatives has shown resistance to a full THC ban, instead advancing measures to expand medical cannabis access. House Bill 46 (HB 46), which broadens the state's Compassionate Use Program, was approved by the House with a vote of 118-16. This bill expands the list of qualifying medical conditions, increases the number of licensed dispensaries to 11, and gives military veterans special access to low-dose THC treatments. Furthermore, a House committee adopted a substitute version of the Senate's SB 3 that is not a full ban, but would allow certain low-THC beverages and tinctures while prohibiting vapes and synthetics. The Texas hemp industry, estimated to be worth $8 billion, and Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller have expressed concerns that a total ban would shutter thousands of businesses.\n\nThe Texas Legislature's regular session is scheduled to end on May 26, 2025, leaving a narrow window for new legislation to pass through all required procedural steps in both chambers and be signed by the governor. While Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick has threatened to force a special session, only Governor Greg Abbott can officially call one and set its agenda. As of mid-May, Governor Abbott's stated public priorities for the session did not include a THC ban. Public opinion appears to favor more access; a University of Houston survey found that 62% of Texans support marijuana legalization and 79% support a comprehensive medical marijuana program. Veterans' groups have also testified in opposition to a ban, citing THC products as an alternative to opioids.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current legal status of hemp-derived THC products continues, and no new statewide ban is enacted.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Texas House and Senate fail to reconcile their vastly different bills before the regular session ends on May 26, 2025. The House's version, which is not a full ban, prevails in blocking the Senate's proposal. Governor Abbott does not call a special session for this issue, as it is not one of his stated priorities, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without a new prohibitory law.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under intense political pressure from Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick in the final days of the session, the House capitulates and passes the Senate's full ban. Alternatively, the issue is forced into a special session called by Governor Abbott, where a compromise is reached or the House is compelled to pass a full ban, which is then signed into law before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is low because the obstacles to passing a full THC ban are significant and numerous. The primary obstacle is the strong disagreement between the two legislative chambers. The Senate has passed a full ban (SB 3), but the House has demonstrated clear opposition by passing a bill to expand medical cannabis access (HB 46) and, more importantly, by amending the Senate's bill into a partial ban that is not a full prohibition. This fundamental policy difference is difficult to bridge, especially given the extremely short timeline, with the regular legislative session ending on May 26, 2025. Furthermore, Governor Greg Abbott, who holds the sole power to call a special session, has not listed a THC ban among his priorities. This significantly weakens Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick's threat of a special session. Finally, there is substantial opposition from the $8 billion Texas hemp industry, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, and veterans' groups, which provides political cover for House members to resist the ban, especially when public opinion polls show majority support for legalization. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because the bill has already passed one chamber with a strong majority, and its primary advocate, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, is one of the most powerful political figures in the state. The possibility of last-minute political horse-trading or a successful pressure campaign on the Governor for a special session cannot be entirely ruled out. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 15% because the combination of a bicameral stalemate, a tight deadline, the Governor's apparent lack of interest, and powerful economic and public opposition makes the passage of a full ban highly improbable. The status quo is strongly favored. I would raise my forecast if Governor Abbott publicly endorses a ban or calls a special session with the ban on the agenda. I would lower it if the regular session ends without a reconciled bill and no special session is announced.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which aims to ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program.
