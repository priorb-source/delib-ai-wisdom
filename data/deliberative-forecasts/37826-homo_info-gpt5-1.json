    "review": "New arguments I hadn’t incorporated: (1) a reported May 10 DGMO-brokered ceasefire with planned pullbacks by end-May (Forecaster 2) materially lowers the near-term hazard; (2) India’s diplomatic campaign (delegations May 21–Jun 5) suggests escalation management rather than imminent strikes (Forecaster 3); (3) explicit authority to Western Command to retaliate to ceasefire violations could marginally raise the chance of cross-IB Army action into Pakistani Punjab if firing resumes (Forecaster 3); and (4) the operational nuance that most routine exchanges occur on the LoC (AJK/GB) or between BSF and Pakistani Rangers along the IB, which would not satisfy this question unless the Indian Armed Forces (Army/IAF) are clearly responsible and the fire lands in the four provinces (both forecasters). I find the ceasefire/de-escalation and institutional/attribution points persuasive and a good corrective to my initial emphasis on continued operations under ‘Operation Sindoor.’",
    "rationale": "I initially set 30% on the logic that India had already crossed thresholds in April–May and that another provocation could produce a Balakot-style action. Weighing the new inputs, I’m revising down for June:\n- De-escalation signal: A May 10 DGMO ceasefire with withdrawals planned by end-May materially reduces the baseline probability of a fresh India-initiated kinetic action into Pakistan proper in June absent a new trigger.\n- Base-rate and attribution constraints: Strikes into KP/Punjab/Sindh/Balochistan are rare; most kinetic activity is LoC-focused (excluded) or BSF–Rangers along the IB (may not qualify unless Army/IAF involvement is clear). This narrows valid pathways for resolution.\n- Signaling mix: India’s diplomatic outreach looks like deterrence/coalition-building and escalation management rather than prelude to immediate kinetic action, though the reported delegation of retaliatory authority to Western Command does keep open a conditional path if Pakistan violates the ceasefire along the IB and the Army responds into Pakistani Punjab.\n- Trigger dependency: The main upside risks are (a) a major mass-casualty terror attack in India in late May/June credibly linked to Pakistan-based groups, or (b) significant Pakistani kinetic action deep in India prompting a rapid punitive strike (air or stand-off) into KP/Punjab. In the absence of these, the one-month window and international pressure make a June strike less likely.\nGiven these, I lower my estimate from 30% to 14%. I would move back up if we see breakdowns of the ceasefire along the IB with Army artillery involvement, NOTAMs/IAF posture changes, or a major terror incident with quick attribution; and down further if withdrawals complete, quiet holds through early June, and mediation messaging continues.",
