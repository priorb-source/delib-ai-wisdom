    "review": "All three forecasters are in broad agreement on the fundamental drivers of this question. We concur that the status quo, with Sheikh Hasina in exile and facing legal action in Bangladesh, is very strong. We also agree that a return presents immense personal and legal risks for her, and that her public vows to return are likely political rhetoric. The primary point of divergence is the exact probability assigned to a 'Yes' outcome. The other two forecasters, at 15%, place a greater weight on Sheikh Hasina's personal history as a bold political operator who might undertake a high-risk gamble. They also assign a 'non-trivial' probability to 'black swan' events, such as a swift extradition arranged via a political backroom deal between India and Bangladesh. I found their emphasis on these two points—Hasina's agency and the possibility of a rapid, politically motivated transfer—to be a compelling counterpoint to my initial, more status-quo-driven forecast.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 5% was anchored heavily on the overwhelming personal risks to Sheikh Hasina and the stability of the interim government, making a return within the very short timeframe seem highly improbable. The other forecasters' analyses have persuaded me that I was likely underestimating two key factors. The first is Sheikh Hasina's track record as a political gambler; a calculated, high-risk return to rally her supporters and challenge the new regime cannot be dismissed as easily as I had first thought. The second is the possibility of a swift political resolution between India and Bangladesh regarding her status, which could bypass a lengthy formal extradition process. While I still assess the fundamental barriers to her return as being extremely high, I now believe my initial 5% forecast did not adequately capture the tail risks associated with a volatile political situation and the agency of the main actor involved. I am therefore updating my forecast upwards to acknowledge this increased uncertainty, raising it from 5% to 10%.",
