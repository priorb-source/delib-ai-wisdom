    "review": "Forecaster 2 introduced a valuable distinction between archiving a specific database (like the 'Billion-Dollar' one) and decommissioning an entire flagship domain like Climate.gov. Their argument that the latter action has a much higher political and public-facing cost is convincing and suggests I initially overweighted the risk of a full takedown. Forecaster 3, however, provided the most decisive piece of evidence: a direct, recent, and public statement from a NOAA spokesperson on April 4, 2025, explicitly stating that 'All NOAA Research sites will remain online.' This is an extremely strong piece of evidence that I had not considered. I find this new information overwhelmingly persuasive as it directly addresses the central uncertainty of the question.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 75% was based on the significant political threats to NOAA and its climate programs, as detailed in my research assistant's report. I reasoned that taking down a website was a plausible, high-visibility action for an administration hostile to the agency's mission. However, the other forecasters' analyses convinced me to update significantly. Forecaster 2's point about the high barrier to taking down an entire domain versus removing specific data was well-made and would have prompted me to update to ~90%. The evidence presented by Forecaster 3 is the primary driver of my new forecast. A specific, on-the-record statement from a NOAA spokesperson guaranteeing the sites will remain online is the strongest possible evidence for a 'Yes' resolution, short of a legal mandate. For the site to go down now would require a rapid and public reversal of this official statement, an action I view as highly unlikely in the ~40-day timeframe. Therefore, I am updating my forecast from 75% to 99%. The remaining 1% risk accounts for low-probability 'black swan' events such as a sudden executive-level override of NOAA's authority, a major successful cyberattack, or a catastrophic technical failure.",
