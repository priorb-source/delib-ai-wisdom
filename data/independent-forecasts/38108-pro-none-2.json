    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) identifies significant savings, but due to bureaucratic friction, verification processes, and the sheer complexity of federal accounting, the total amount officially claimed on their website by July 1, 2025, is a substantial but lower figure, for instance, $130 billion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Leveraging powerful AI tools and strong political backing, Doge rapidly identifies several massive sources of waste and fraud (e.g., in pandemic relief funds or Medicare). The definition of 'claimed savings' is interpreted broadly to include projected future savings, allowing them to quickly surpass the $200 billion threshold in a politically motivated announcement to demonstrate the project's success.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the exceptionally short timeline. The question resolves in one month. The background information from February 2025 cites an estimate of 'over $100 billion' in potential waste. For the outcome to be 'Yes,' the claimed savings would need to have roughly doubled from that initial high-level estimate in just over four months. While the initiative is led by tech-focused individuals who may operate faster than typical government bodies, the processes of identifying, verifying, and officially claiming savings at the federal level are notoriously slow and complex. Any such claim would face immense scrutiny. The status quo for large-scale government audits and efficiency projects suggests that realizing and documenting $200 billion in savings is a multi-year effort, not a six-month one. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 20% because there is a significant political incentive to announce a large, headline-grabbing number. The term 'claimed savings' could be defined flexibly to include long-term projections or prevented future expenditures, which could inflate the total. The project has high-level support, which may help it cut through some red tape. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 20% because the base rate for such undertakings points strongly towards a slower, more incremental process. The initial '$100 billion' figure serves as a strong anchor, and doubling it in such a short period represents an extraordinary, and thus less likely, outcome. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there were official statements or credible leaks in the coming month suggesting that a major source of savings had been found and fast-tracked for verification. I would decrease it if reports emerged of bureaucratic roadblocks or internal decisions to use a more conservative accounting methodology for their claims.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Doge claim a total savings of $200 billion or more on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Tech guru admired by Elon Musk estimates ‘over $100 billion’ in taxpayer money is being wasted or stolen](https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/us-news/tech-guru-admired-by-elon-musk-estimates-over-100-billion-in-taxpayer-money-is-being-wasted-or-stolen/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Department of Government Efficiency [claims](https://doge.gov/savings) a total estimated savings of greater than or equal to $200 billion when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
