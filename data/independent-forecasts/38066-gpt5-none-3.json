    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 22 days (until 00:00 PDT on June 18, 2025); at most ~35 days (until the July 1, 2025 resolution deadline)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — they speak in separate sessions and do not share the stage.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Both give individual keynotes/fireside chats at different times; stage management avoids overlap during handoffs; or one appears remotely/doesn’t attend, preventing any on-stage co-presence.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "YC programs a joint fireside chat/debate, opening/closing panel, or orchestrates a brief joint appearance (e.g., photo/Q&A) where both are physically on stage at the same time within the event window.",
    "rationale": "Baseline conference programming puts headline speakers in separate slots; absent an explicit, pre-announced joint session, the status quo favors No. There’s also execution risk: Elon Musk’s attendance at third‑party events is less reliable than typical speakers, and a remote appearance would not qualify. Additionally, given their well-publicized tensions over AI and OpenAI, both sides have incentives to keep appearances separate unless a joint segment is deliberately planned and negotiated in advance. While YC would benefit from the buzz of a joint conversation—and they have shared a stage in the distant past—doing so now would require coordination, legal/PR comfort, and heightened security, all of which reduce spontaneous or last‑minute chances. Quantitatively, I model: P(both attend in person) ~0.70–0.75 (Altman very likely; Musk less so). Conditional on both being there, P(a planned or incidental on‑stage overlap) ~0.20–0.25 given typical agendas and the need for explicit coordination. Multiplying gives ~14–19%. I center at 18% to allow for YC’s appetite for headline moments and the small possibility of a brief orchestrated joint appearance (e.g., opening/closing). Why not higher: There’s no public confirmation of a joint segment; conference norms and risk management favor separate appearances; and Musk’s attendance variability and potential preference for solo platforms reduce odds. Why not lower: YC has strong promotional incentives, and a short, symbolic joint moment would satisfy the criterion without a full debate; both are already announced as headliners, which lowers logistical barriers if they choose to do it. What would move me up: An official agenda listing a joint session; credible reporting or social posts from YC leadership (e.g., Garry Tan) or either principal hinting at a joint fireside/debate; leaks of security planning for a joint segment. What would move me down: Any indication one will appear remotely or cancel; a published agenda showing strictly separate venues/times with tight stage turnovers; statements from either party ruling out a joint appearance. Research assistant provided no additional info, so this rests on base rates for conference programming, public incentives/constraints, and attendance risk.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
