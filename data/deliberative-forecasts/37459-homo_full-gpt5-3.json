    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base-case: status quo behavior, very low turnover, Buffett’s comments on capital intensity, and longstanding hesitations about several Mag 7 names all point to No. The most useful incremental argument they added was the explicit “Yes” path via the expiration of a prior confidential-treatment request that could reveal an already-built stake in Q1’s 13F. I had emphasized confidentiality mainly as a reason we might not see a new position; their framing adds an offsetting possibility. They also stressed quarter-end valuations still being elevated, which lowers the likelihood of a new Q1 entry—consistent with my view. Overall, their reasoning is coherent and consistent with mine; the CT-expiry path is the only factor nudging me slightly upward.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Berkshire has been a net seller with record cash and minimal portfolio turnover, and Buffett has signaled caution on Mag 7 capital intensity. Historical reluctance toward Microsoft (optics), Tesla (skepticism), and semis (TSMC exit; valuation risk around Nvidia) further lowers odds. Q1’s pricing—especially for Meta/Microsoft/Nvidia—was not obviously bargain territory into Mar 31, making fresh Q1 buying less likely if valuation discipline binds.  \n\nPaths to Yes remain: a modest, disclosed position initiated by Combs/Weschler in Alphabet/Meta/Microsoft; or a confidential-treatment period ending that causes Q1’s 13F to newly show a previously accumulated stake. Both are plausible but unsupported by leaks or AGM hints. The confidentiality dynamic cuts both ways: if accumulation is ongoing, Q1 could still omit it (No); but if a CT window expires, Q1 could newly disclose it (Yes). Given no credible pre-13F signals, the base rate and recent behavior still dominate.  \n\nNet effect: I slightly raise my estimate to reflect the underweighted CT-expiry path, but maintain a low overall probability due to inertia, valuation, and disclosure uncertainty.",
