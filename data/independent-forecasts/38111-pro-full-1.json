  "information": "A high-level international conference on the two-state solution is scheduled for June 17-20, 2025, at the UN headquarters in New York. The conference is co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia and is based on a UN General Assembly resolution from December 2024. Its stated aim is to generate momentum for more countries to recognize a Palestinian state. Supporting this effort, the Arab Group at the UN has urged member countries to recognize Palestine as a step toward lasting peace. Additionally, the 'Madrid+' group, comprising Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and Norway, has called for Palestine's full UN membership, describing it as a \"political and diplomatic necessity.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has stated that recognizing a Palestinian state is a \"moral and political obligation\" and has indicated that France may officially grant recognition during the June UN conference, although he has also tied the move to certain conditions. In May 2025, the UK announced it had joined France's initiative for the recognition of a Palestinian state. According to a report by Axios, Malta is also preparing to declare Palestine's independence at the summit on June 20. Five Arab countries—Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia—have announced their active participation in organizing the conference.\n\nAs of May 2025, 147 out of 193 UN member states officially recognize the State of Palestine, while 46 members do not. The non-recognizing states include most Western European nations, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea. In 2024, five countries newly recognized Palestine: Norway, Ireland, Spain, Slovenia, and Armenia. The Israeli government strongly opposes the international recognition effort. An Israeli official stated the country \"will not cooperate\" with such measures and warned of potential further annexation of the West Bank. The United States and several other G7 members also continue to withhold official recognition.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Despite diplomatic discussions, no UN member state officially changes its policy to recognize Palestine in June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The UN conference in June concludes with a joint declaration of intent and support for a two-state solution, but key actors like France and the UK decide to postpone formal recognition, citing the need for further coordination or more favorable conditions. Intense diplomatic pressure from the US and Israel persuades smaller countries like Malta to also delay, and the month ends with no new recognitions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "During the high-level UN conference from June 17-20, Malta, as reported, announces its formal recognition of the State of Palestine. Seizing the political momentum from the conference, France, or another member of the 'Madrid+' group, follows suit, triggering a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "rationale": "There is significant momentum favoring a 'Yes' outcome. The recognition of Palestine by five countries in 2024, including several EU members, has broken a long-standing inertia. The upcoming UN conference in June, co-chaired by France, creates a powerful focal point designed specifically to encourage further recognitions. The key evidence supporting a high probability is the Axios report that Malta is actively preparing to recognize Palestine at this summit. The bar for a 'Yes' resolution is low—only one UN member country is required to make an announcement. The active push from the 'Madrid+' group (Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, Norway) and the Franco-British initiative further increases the likelihood that at least one of these, or another sympathetic nation, will act in June. The probability is not higher because of the significant counter-pressure from Israel and the United States, which could persuade some nations to delay. Furthermore, statements from leaders like French President Macron have included conditions, introducing uncertainty about the timing of a potential French recognition. It is possible the conference results in strong commitments but that formal announcements are pushed to a later date. The probability is not lower because the confluence of a dedicated high-level event, recent precedents, and specific intelligence about Malta's intentions makes it very likely that at least one country will cross the line in June. I would raise my forecast if a foreign minister from a country like France or Malta explicitly confirms plans for a June announcement. I would lower it if the conference were postponed or if the US launched a major, successful diplomatic counter-offensive.",
