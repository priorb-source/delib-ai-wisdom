    "review": "Both forecasters make strong points about (1) the very high baseline rate of 10k+ protests in 2025 and (2) clear focal dates (May 18 Gwangju commemoration, June 3 election, and possible post-election contention). Forecaster 3 also notes South Korea’s prominence and the likelihood of documentation. However, both underweight the resolution mechanics: the Global Protest Tracker often treats multi-month contention as a single entry with an earlier start date, and this question requires the GPT start date to be after May 1, 2025. Forecaster 2’s 95% largely assumes any large protest will translate into a new GPT entry with a fresh start date, which is not assured. Forecaster 3 acknowledges coverage risk but, in my view, still overestimates the probability that GPT will create a distinct post–May 1 entry rather than rolling events into an existing 2024–25 wave with a December 2024 or early-2025 start date.",
    "rationale": "I continue to see two hurdles: (A) Will there be 10k+ protests in the window? Likely yes (roughly 70–80%) given recent size/frequency, May 18 and June 3 focal points, and active organizing. (B) Will GPT record such protests as a new entry with a start date after May 1 rather than subsuming them under a late-2024/early-2025 start? This is the key uncertainty. If post-election protests are framed as a distinct episode (e.g., ‘post-election protests’), the chance of a fresh start date rises; South Korea’s prominence also boosts inclusion odds. Balancing these, I modestly raise my forecast: the election is a compelling breakpoint that could produce a clearly defined new wave. Still, the consolidation risk remains material. I’d move higher if we saw credible calls for mass post-election protests or GPT added a South Korea entry with a May/June 2025 start. I’d move lower if May–June mobilizations are framed as continuations of the December 2024 wave or if the election outcome is uncontested with minimal street action.",
