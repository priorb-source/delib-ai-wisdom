    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my initial framing: base rates and the current occupant (non-U.S.) point to No, with short-term U.S. market tailwinds as the main upside risk. Forecaster 3 adds two useful emphases: the short time horizon (≈33 days) increasing status-quo stickiness, and that the recent $304B wealth boost wasn’t U.S.-concentrated—weakening the argument that recent gains disproportionately help U.S. billionaires near the cutoff. Forecaster 2’s triggers (US-EU deal, U.S. tech outperformance) match my own monitoring list. I didn’t see decisive new data, but Forecaster 3’s emphasis on time-to-resolution and seasonality supports a slight downward tilt from the ~38% base rate.",
    "rationale": "Key points: (1) Base rate at ranks 200–300 suggests ~38% chance the #250 is U.S.; (2) Recent incumbents at #250 are non-U.S. (Italy, then Russia); (3) U.S. share in the top 500 reportedly fell from ~40% to ~35% over the past year; (4) Seasonal pattern tends to be less favorable for U.S. presence in Q1–Q2; (5) Only ~1 month remains, which increases the weight on the status quo and underlying composition. Upside risks remain: potential U.S. equity/FX outperformance in June, plus high churn near the cutoff. However, Forecaster 3’s point that the recent wealth surge was not distinctly U.S.-skewed, combined with the short horizon and seasonality, nudges me slightly below my prior. I make a small downward adjustment, staying close to but below the 38% base-rate anchor.",
