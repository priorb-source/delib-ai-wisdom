    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises the most crucial point that I underweighted in my initial analysis: the BBC article headline itself states that a 'main opposition leader' has been removed from the electoral list, and several candidates on our specific list (Laurent Gbagbo, Simone Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan) are indeed prominent opposition figures who could fit this description. This is a critical insight. The question asks whether any candidate will be disqualified 'before July 1, 2025' - if the BBC article describes a recent disqualification of one of these five, the answer would already be YES. Forecaster 3 correctly identifies the central uncertainty: whether the removed candidate mentioned in the BBC article is one of our five specific individuals. The research assistant's 'no additional information available' suggests they couldn't confirm this either way, which is telling. Both forecasters make valid points about the short 32-day timeframe limiting new disqualifications while potentially explaining why we lack confirmation of recent events. The key tension is between: (1) the high likelihood that prominent opposition leaders like the Gbagbos or Affi N'Guessan could be the 'main opposition leader' referenced, versus (2) the lack of specific confirmation that any of these five has been disqualified. I find Forecaster 2's reasoning more persuasive than I initially credited - the overlap between 'main opposition leader' and these specific candidates is substantial.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I underweighted the significance of the BBC article potentially referring to one of our five candidates. Given that Laurent Gbagbo is a former president, Simone Gbagbo is a major political figure, and Pascal Affi N'Guessan is an opposition leader, the probability that the 'main opposition leader' mentioned in the BBC article is one of them is higher than I initially assessed. However, the research assistant's inability to provide confirming information suggests genuine uncertainty. The 32-day remaining window means limited time for additional disqualifications, so the primary probability mass should be on whether a disqualification has already occurred. Balancing these factors, I'm updating upward from my initial 35% but not as high as Forecaster 2's 65%, as the lack of specific confirmation remains meaningful. A forecast around 50% better reflects the genuine uncertainty about whether the BBC article refers to one of these five specific candidates versus another opposition figure.",
