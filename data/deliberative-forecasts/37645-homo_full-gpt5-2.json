    "review": "Both forecasters largely echo my base read: the mid‑April confidence vote removed the automatic snap trigger; officials project stability; protests are waning and the opposition is fragmented; Vučić’s rhetoric preserves optionality. The main incremental emphasis is the near‑term hazard from Vučić’s May 14 “within ten days” remark. One point I disagree with: the suggestion that an autumn election date could be officially announced in late May/June. Given Serbia’s typical 45–60 day window between dissolution and election day (e.g., Nov 1→Dec 17, 2023), a legally valid decree with a specific date before July 1 would all but force an August vote. If the government prefers autumn, it has a strong incentive not to announce before July 1. Overall, their reasoning is sound on dynamics and optionality, but I weight the legal/timing constraint and fresh‑cabinet optics a bit more heavily, keeping me below 20%.",
    "rationale": "Key factors: (1) Institutional/timing: With a new cabinet approved mid‑April, there’s no constitutional compulsion. An official announcement before July 1 would likely entail an August election, an unattractive window (summer holidays/turnout optics). If leadership wants autumn, they would wait past July 1. (2) Politics: Government asserts a stable majority; calling elections weeks after forming a cabinet risks appearing reactive. (3) Protests: While public sympathy exists, momentum appears to have eased; opposition fragmentation reduces pressure. (4) Vučić’s behavior: He does use snap polls tactically, and his May 14 “ten days” line creates a short‑term tail risk of a sudden pivot. That warrants some probability, but without visible coalition strain or a major trigger, it’s still a minority scenario. I nudge up slightly to reflect the near‑term rhetorical signal but stay well below the peers’ 20% given the legal calendar and fresh‑government optics.",
