    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. I find Forecaster 3's reasoning to be highly compelling, while I believe Forecaster 2 is too optimistic. Forecaster 2's forecast of 18% seems to be based on an assumption that the single Rwanda data point represents a pilot report and can be extrapolated to an annual rate of 1-2 such reports. As Forecaster 3 correctly points out, the provided example is not explicitly designated as a pilot report, making this extrapolation weak. Forecaster 3's analysis aligns closely with my initial assessment of a low base rate but adds two crucial points I had not fully weighed: (1) the ambiguity of the single data point, and (2) the operational risk of NUFORC's posting delay, which could cause a qualifying event to be posted after the resolution date. This 'timing risk' is a significant additional hurdle for a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 7% was based on the low base rate of an African pilot report being logged by NUFORC in any given month. The deliberation process has convinced me to lower this forecast. The arguments from Forecaster 3 were particularly influential. I had not adequately considered the risk of posting delays by the volunteer-run NUFORC. A sighting and report in late June could easily fail to be published by the July 1st cutoff, making the effective window for resolution shorter than the full month. This procedural friction adds another significant failure point. Furthermore, Forecaster 3's critique of using the ambiguous Rwanda report as strong evidence for an established pilot reporting channel from Africa is valid. This weakens the only piece of supporting evidence provided. Combining the extremely low base rate of such a specific confluence of events (geography, reporter type, time window, reporting channel) with the newly considered posting delay risk, I believe a probability of 7% is slightly too high. Therefore, I am adjusting my forecast downward to better reflect the multiple, independent ways this question is likely to resolve 'No'.",
