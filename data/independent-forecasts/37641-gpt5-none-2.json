    "yes_outcome_scenario": "SEC declares Circle’s S-1 effective in June, the company conducts a brief roadshow, prices the deal, and shares of Circle Internet Group, Inc. begin trading on the NYSE under an approved ticker before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and setup: Circle has been pursuing a U.S. listing, and an April 2025 Forbes piece characterizes the IPO as a key event for 2025. That implies real momentum and a plausible H1 2025 timeline. However, the question resolves only if shares are trading on the NYSE before July 1, 2025, a stricter condition than simply “IPO in 2025.” My assistant turned up no additional details such as an exchange selection, ticker, or a set pricing date.  - Timing mechanics: From a public S-1 to pricing typically takes several weeks to a few months, depending on SEC review and market conditions. With roughly 6–7 weeks left, it’s feasible but tight. A June listing is possible if SEC comments are largely resolved and the window remains open.  - Exchange uncertainty: The criterion requires NYSE specifically. If Circle were to choose Nasdaq, this resolves No even if the IPO prices in June. Absent confirmation, exchange choice meaningfully lowers the probability of a Yes.  - Base rates and status quo: Currently not listed; most things don’t change quickly. IPOs can slip for process or market reasons, and crypto/fintech names can be sensitive to volatility and regulatory feedback.  - Why not higher: (1) The NYSE-specific requirement introduces a binary exchange risk; (2) limited time remains for final SEC clearance, marketing, and listing; (3) any hiccup could push the debut into July or later.  - Why not lower: (1) Clear signals that Circle is intent on going public in 2025; (2) an April article suggests active progress, consistent with a late-Q2 window; (3) if the exchange is NYSE and the file is near-effective, a late-June debut is well within normal timelines.  - What would move me up: Credible reports/filings naming NYSE, NYSE ticker reservation/approval, launch of the roadshow with indicated late-June pricing, or the SEC declaring the registration effective.  - What would move me down: Any report of Nasdaq selection, guidance that the roadshow/pricing is slated for July or later, material SEC delays, or a broader market drawdown that shuts the IPO window.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Circle be publicly-traded before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nForbes: [The Circle IPO Solidifies 2025 As The Year Of Stablecoins](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/04/04/the-circle-ipo-solidifies-2025-as-the-year-of-stablecoin/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if shares of Circle Internet Group, Inc. are publicly traded on New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
