  "information": "Somalia's National Communications Authority granted Starlink a full operating license in mid-April 2025, following approximately two and a half years of discussions. On April 13, 2025, Elon Musk announced on social media, \"Starlink is in Somalia.\" At a ceremony in Mogadishu, Starlink representatives stated the service would be available nationwide soon. Somali government officials, including the Minister of Communications and Technology, publicly welcomed the service, highlighting its potential to provide internet access across the country. As of mid-May 2025, the official Starlink availability map listed Somalia as \"Not Available\" or \"Coming Soon.\"\n\nThe time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming \"Available\" varies. For several African nations, the lag has been several months: Nigeria's service went live approximately four months after licensing in 2023, while Rwanda's took about four months. The median time for recent African launches has been estimated at 4–8 months. However, some rollouts have been much faster; for example, Bangladesh's service became available in about two weeks in May 2025. Conversely, some countries, such as Zambia, India, and Vietnam, have remained in a \"Coming Soon\" status for many months after receiving licenses.\n\nStarlink can provide service to Somalia without an in-country gateway station due to its use of inter-satellite laser links, which can connect to ground stations in neighboring countries like Kenya or Ethiopia. A report by the Washington Post indicated that the U.S. government has been diplomatically promoting Starlink's expansion in various countries, including Somalia. Local challenges in Somalia include a fragile security environment, complex import logistics for user terminals, and difficulties with payment processing infrastructure. According to 2022 World Bank data, about 30% of Somalia's 18 million people have internet access.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1.5 months. The deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is May 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of mid-May 2025, the Starlink availability map lists Somalia as 'Not Available' or 'Coming Soon', not 'Available'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Logistical or operational delays prevent Starlink from activating the service commercially before July 1, 2025. Challenges such as importing user terminals, establishing reliable payment systems, or addressing security concerns push the official launch date past the deadline, and the map remains unchanged.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capitalizing on the recent license approval and public announcements, Starlink prioritizes the Somalia launch. The use of inter-satellite links from gateways in neighboring countries allows for rapid service activation, and the first batch of user terminals is successfully distributed, prompting Starlink to update its map to 'Available' sometime in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the conflict between strong political momentum and typical operational timelines, with the latter being more influential. The primary factors supporting a 'Yes' outcome are the official license grant in mid-April 2025 and the high-profile announcements from both Elon Musk and the Somali government, creating pressure for a swift rollout. Furthermore, the technical ability to service Somalia via laser links from gateways in neighboring countries removes a significant potential bottleneck. However, several factors support a 'No' outcome. The time between the license approval (mid-April) and the deadline (July 1) is approximately 2.5 months. This is substantially shorter than the median 4-8 month timeline observed for recent Starlink launches in other African nations like Nigeria and Rwanda, which both took around four months. While faster launches, like Bangladesh's (~2 weeks), have occurred, they appear to be exceptions. More critically, the research report highlights specific local challenges in Somalia, including a 'fragile security environment, complex import logistics for user terminals, and difficulties with payment processing infrastructure.' These are significant, concrete hurdles that often cause delays. Given these specific operational frictions and the precedent of longer rollout times in the region, it is more likely that the launch will be pushed beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline. My forecast is not lower because the public commitment from Starlink's leadership and the Somali government could lead to an expedited process, and the technical prerequisites are largely in place. My forecast is not higher because the operational challenges are substantial and the historical data from similar markets points to a longer timeline than the one available. I would increase my probability upon seeing news of Starlink terminals arriving in-country or a specific launch date being announced. I would decrease it if no progress is reported by mid-June.",
