    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical distinction I underweighted: the 35-40% historical base rate applies to advance-to-third estimate dynamics, but we're now evaluating from the second estimate position. Since typical second-to-third revisions are only 0.1-0.2 percentage points and we need a +0.3pp revision, this argues for a lower probability than I initially assigned. Forecaster 2's analysis is sound but may be slightly optimistic by applying the advance-estimate base rate too directly to our current second-estimate position. Both forecasters correctly identify the volatile import component as the most likely source of significant revision. The key insight from Forecaster 3 that changes my view: we've already consumed one round of revisions (advance to second), and the remaining typical revision magnitude is smaller than what we require.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I overweighted the 35-40% historical rate without adequately accounting for where we are in the revision sequence. Starting from the second estimate of -0.2%, we need a +0.3pp revision to cross zero - this is 1.5-3x larger than the typical second-to-third revision magnitude of 0.1-0.2pp. The general sign-change rate of less than 20% is also more relevant now. However, three factors prevent me from going as low as 30%: (1) we're exceptionally close to the threshold, requiring only modest absolute movement; (2) the massive import subtraction (-4.9pp) was the primary driver and remains highly revision-prone with complete March data incoming; and (3) we've already seen positive revision momentum. The volatile trade component combined with annual benchmark revisions to services data creates meaningful tail risk for larger-than-typical revisions. Balancing the need for an above-average second-to-third revision against our proximity to zero and the specific composition of Q1's weakness, I'm revising down but not to the full extent Forecaster 3 suggests.",
