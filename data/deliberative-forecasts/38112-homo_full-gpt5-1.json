    "review": "Both forecasters largely corroborate my base case: host-level caution from Brazil, unanimity hurdles, and recent coordination frictions point toward no invitation. I found Forecaster 3’s emphasis on the optics for Brazil of inviting polarizing candidates (e.g., Belarus, Cuba) a useful addition that further dampens near-term odds, and Forecaster 2’s framing of the guest list (Mexico, Uruguay, Colombia) as outreach without commitment is consistent with my priors. Neither brings new concrete signals (leaks, sherpa briefings, draft text) that would move me meaningfully. Their ranges (15–18%) align with mine; I don’t see a reason to shift based on their arguments alone.",
    "rationale": "Core factors remain: (1) Brazil’s public ‘stabilise’ stance as host and agenda-setter; (2) unanimity requirement amid recent disunity (April FMs’ failure to issue a joint communiqué); (3) a low-friction partner framework that satisfies expansion optics without the costs of full invitations; (4) weak candidate momentum—some partners haven’t confirmed participation; Kazakhstan explicitly not seeking full membership; and no credible pre-summit reporting on a consensus candidate. The short runway (about five weeks) further reduces odds absent leaks. A non-trivial tail persists because China/Russia may push for a single ‘safe’ addition to sustain the expansion narrative, and BRICS can strike last-minute deals—Indonesia’s quick move shows the pathway exists. But with Brazil inclined to pause and India typically cautious, the bar for consensus appears high. Net: keep a modest but low probability and watch for concrete pre-summit signals (named shortlists, Brazil softening, draft declaration language). No change to my forecast.",
