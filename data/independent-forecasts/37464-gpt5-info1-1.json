  "information": "LPK1, a Renton, Washington establishment, is recalling approximately 303 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken Caesar wrap products. The recall was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, as the Caesar dressing packet contains fish (anchovies) which is not declared on the product label. The recall is designated as Class II. The affected products were produced on February 15, 17, and 19, 2025. The corresponding 'best by' dates were February 21, 23, and 25, 2025, and the lot codes were LPK1WA046, LPK1WA048, and LPK1WA050.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 24 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall page still shows Active as of now, so if nothing changes it will not be closed by June 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS leaves the recall in Active status through June 1 because effectiveness checks/corrective action verification or paperwork aren’t completed, or the page isn’t updated before the weekend cutoff.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "LPK1 completes corrective actions and documentation; FSIS verifies product control and effectiveness and updates the recall page to Closed sometime in May.",
    "rationale": "Key facts: This is a small Class II misbranding/undeclared allergen recall (anchovies in Caesar dressing packet) of about 303 lbs, produced Feb 15/17/19 with best-by dates Feb 21/23/25. Posted Feb 24, 2025. Distribution appears limited (vending machines in WA). Such perishable, limited-scope, Class II recalls often close within roughly 1–3 months once effectiveness checks and corrective actions are verified. We are now about 10–11 weeks post-posting with 24 days left until June 1. That timing favors closure before June 1, but as of today the recall is still Active, and FSIS sometimes takes longer (documentation, verification, or backlog). A weekend cutoff risk also exists: if closure would occur the first business days of June, that resolves as No. Why not higher: The status quo is Active at ~10+ weeks; some FSIS recalls remain Active for several months, and updates might slip past June 1. Why not lower: The small size, perishable product with expired best-by dates in late Feb, and limited distribution increase the odds that verification and closure can be finalized in May. What would move me up: Evidence the firm has completed label corrections or that FSIS updated related recalls quickly in May; an “updated” note on the recall page suggesting progress; firm press release confirming corrective actions accepted by FSIS. What would move me down: Any expansion of the recall, additional FSIS questions, enforcement actions, or lack of page updates by late May suggesting ongoing verification or administrative delay.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nLPK1, a Renton, Washington establishment, is recalling approximately 303 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken Caesar wrap products. The recall was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, as the Caesar dressing packet contains fish (anchovies) which is not declared on the product label.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
