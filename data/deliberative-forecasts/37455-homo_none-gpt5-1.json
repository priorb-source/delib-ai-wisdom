    "review": "Both forecasters closely mirror my priors. Useful incremental points: (1) the end-of-Q2 cadence as a plausible internal milestone for Starlink map updates; (2) explicit watch-outs for “H2 2025”/“Available soon” labels on the map; and (3) clearer emphasis on post-license steps (type approval, tax/e‑commerce enablement). No new hard evidence was introduced, and their arguments balance similarly between fast-follow rollouts versus administrative lag. I find their reasoning sound but not materially shifting the probability mass.",
    "rationale": "Time left: about 55 days until July 1, 2025. Status quo: the map does not show Lesotho as Available; if nothing changes, it resolves No. A Yes path is straightforward: with licensing reportedly granted in mid-April, Starlink completes back-office steps (type approval, VAT registration/payment rails, shipping logistics) and flips Lesotho to Available—often achievable in weeks. A No path: residual regulatory/administrative steps take longer, or Starlink batches updates and deprioritizes a small market, pushing the map change into July or later. Countervailing considerations: satellites already cover Lesotho and recent African rollouts have often been quick post-license, but Starlink has also shown multi-month lags in some markets. Being landlocked and small could dampen prioritization and complicate logistics, though map availability doesn’t strictly depend on hardware being in-country. The additional deliberation did not add concrete new signals, only framing that modestly supports both sides. Net, I keep a modestly-above-even stance. I would move up on any official Starlink/X announcement or if checkout/pricing enables for Lesotho addresses; I would move down if the map explicitly shifts timing to H2 2025 or if the regulator signals pending type approvals or conditions.",
