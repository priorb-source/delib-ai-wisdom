    "review": "Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the sequential steps (cabinet/transmittal → TNLA passage → presidential assent → AU deposit) and South Sudan’s slow ratification track record is persuasive and aligns with my prior reasoning. Their base-rate framing and focus on deposit mechanics are strong. Forecaster 3 adds potential positive signals (Trade Minister’s April commitment; EAC technical engagement) that I hadn’t weighed explicitly; if substantiated, they modestly raise odds. However, Forecaster 3’s 35% seems high without concrete evidence of a bill on the order paper, cabinet approval, or preparations for deposit—especially given the tight timeline and institutional constraints. Overall, F2’s analysis is more consistent with available signals; F3’s added signals nudge probability up slightly but don’t overcome the procedural and bandwidth hurdles.",
    "rationale": "Roughly 60 days remain. The status quo is non-ratification; TNLA has sat infrequently, the May–June calendar lists no trade bills, the government is dealing with severe fiscal and political disruptions, and there’s no sign that AfCFTA-related obligations are budgeted or that an instrument of ratification is being prepared. Ratification can be fast-tracked if leadership prioritizes it, and public signaling (if confirmed) from the Trade Ministry and EAC engagement are mild positives. But absent visible movement—cabinet clearance, bill tabling/scheduling, or reports of instrument preparation—the probability remains low. I’m making a small upward adjustment to reflect the possibility of a political push yielding a quick, symbolic ratification, but the short runway plus deposit requirement still dominate. I would revise up materially on credible reports of cabinet approval and TNLA scheduling/passage or confirmation that the instrument is ready for imminent deposit; I would revise down if parliament recesses or the security/fiscal crises further crowd out legislative time.",
