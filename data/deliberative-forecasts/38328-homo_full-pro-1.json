    "review": "All three forecasters have identified the same core drivers for a 'Yes' outcome: the high baseline rate of turnover, the acute pressure from the Huawei scandal, and the potential for MEPs to be appointed to national governments. Our initial forecasts are tightly clustered (79-82%), indicating strong agreement on the fundamentals. The most critical new point was raised by Forecaster 3, who correctly noted a key timing risk I had overlooked: the resolution window begins on June 10. The MEP arrested on June 5, Fulvio Martusciello, is arguably the most likely single individual to resign, but he faces maximum pressure to do so *now*, before the resolution window opens. If he resigns between June 5 and June 9, the question will not resolve as 'Yes' due to his departure, and a significant driver of the high probability will have been exhausted.",
    "rationale": "My original forecast of 82% was based on the powerful convergence of three independent factors: the historical base rate of resignations, the immense pressure from the ongoing Huawei scandal, and the likelihood of MEPs departing for national government posts. The reasoning from my peers affirms these core drivers. However, Forecaster 3's analysis has convinced me to revise my forecast downwards. My initial model did not adequately account for the specific timing of the resolution window. The question resolves 'Yes' only for resignations announced *after* June 9. The arrest of an MEP on June 5 creates a point of maximal pressure for an immediate resignation. There is a non-trivial chance that this individual resigns prior to June 10, which would remove the most likely scandal-related resignation from the pool of possibilities for the resolution period. This introduces a plausible failure mode for my forecast that I had not sufficiently weighted. While a 'Yes' outcome remains highly probable due to the other four implicated MEPs, the potential for national appointments, and the baseline turnover rate, this timing risk is significant enough to warrant a moderate reduction in my confidence. I am therefore lowering my forecast by 4 percentage points.",
