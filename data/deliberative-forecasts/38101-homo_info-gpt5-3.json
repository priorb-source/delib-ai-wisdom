    "review": "Forecaster 2’s argument is solid and largely consistent with my prior: the 7-day trailing average, short time horizon, and tie-as-No all bias against a Yes. Their identification of near-term UK downside catalysts (e.g., a June fiscal/spending announcement) is a useful addition and nudges me slightly more negative. Their base claim that Ishiba is narrowly ahead in late May aligns with the RA’s note on Morning Consult.\n\nForecaster 3’s case leans heavily on non–Morning Consult cabinet approval (Asahi) from March and a narrative of persistent scandal drag. That’s directionally informative but not directly comparable to Morning Consult’s leader approval. Crucially, it downplays the RA’s late-May Morning Consult indication that Ishiba may be above Starmer (≈32 vs. 28), which directly contradicts the premise that Ishiba remains clearly depressed. Given we resolve on Morning Consult specifically, I find F3’s 76% too high and insufficiently anchored to the most relevant, recent series.\n",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~1 month. Status quo per late-May Morning Consult snapshots has Ishiba slightly ahead; ties resolve to No. The 7-day moving average and short window reduce the likelihood of a rank flip absent a clear catalyst.\n\nUK: Starmer’s approval has been volatile (early May ≈36%, late May ≈28%). Near-term UK events could cut either way (e.g., BoE decision, fiscal communications), but the identified potential negatives (spending/fiscal details, ongoing economic/service pressures) marginally raise the risk of flat-to-down rather than a rebound by July 1.\n\nJapan: Ishiba’s approval has also moved, with indications of a late-May uptick into the low 30s despite earlier scandal-related lows in other polling. Without a major positive or negative shock, a modest persistence in the low 30s seems plausible through late June. Yen/inflation dynamics and LDP issues are downside risks, but we need a relative reversal within a smoothed weekly window.\n\nNet: Given current ordering, smoothing, tie-as-No, and limited time, the base case remains No. I slightly lower my estimate to reflect Forecaster 2’s added near-term UK downside catalysts and the fact that the most relevant, recent Morning Consult read appears to favor Ishiba.\n",
