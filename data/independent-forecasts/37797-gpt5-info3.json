  "information": "Indian government officials announced in May 2025 their intention to submit fresh intelligence to the FATF concerning terrorist infrastructure operating within Pakistan. This development follows Pakistan's removal from the FATF Grey List in October 2022. At the time of its removal, the FATF noted that Pakistan should continue working with the Asia Pacific Group (APG) to improve its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing systems. Separately, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also recently advised Pakistan to enhance its AML/CFT effectiveness.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~5–6 weeks (until the FATF June 2025 Plenary communiqué is published)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No change: the blacklist remains North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FATF concludes there’s insufficient new evidence or consensus to warrant changes; ongoing concerns about DPRK, Iran, and Myanmar persist, with no jurisdiction qualifying for addition and none showing enough progress for removal.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "FATF adds a jurisdiction deemed non-cooperative with serious AML/CFT deficiencies (e.g., an escalatory move against a high-risk country following clear non-cooperation), or removes one of the current three due to demonstrable, verified remediation—both historically rare. A politically driven addition (e.g., sharp escalation against Russia or sudden deterioration in another jurisdiction) is another, albeit unlikely, path.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: Changes to the FATF blacklist are infrequent; the grey list churns regularly, but the blacklist seldom changes. Since Myanmar’s addition in Oct 2022, there have been no widely reported blacklist moves, including at recent plenaries. That implies a low per-plenary base rate for change.\n\nCurrent signals: The assistant notes India plans to submit fresh intelligence to FATF regarding terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan, and the IMF has urged Pakistan to improve AML/CFT effectiveness. While this raises the probability of scrutiny, Pakistan more plausibly re-enters the grey list first; a jump to the blacklist is very unlikely given FATF process and precedent. Removal scenarios (Iran, DPRK, Myanmar) look implausible before June 2025: no public evidence of substantial, verified remediation or political thaw that would satisfy FATF standards. A major escalatory addition like blacklisting Russia would be unprecedented and would likely be telegraphed in advance; so far FATF has opted for suspension rather than blacklisting.\n\nWhy not higher: The blacklist’s high bar and consensus-driven process, lack of prior signalling for an imminent change, and the short time horizon until June argue for a low probability. The Pakistan news is more consistent with potential future grey-list actions than immediate blacklisting.\n\nWhy not lower: A non-zero chance remains for an unexpected political escalation or a sudden FATF determination that a jurisdiction is non-cooperative to a degree warranting a call for action. Myanmar’s situation is volatile, and geopolitical shocks can move FATF decisions.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible leaks or official FATF/APG notices indicating intent to place a specific jurisdiction under a call for action; a severe, well-documented AML/CFT breakdown or refusal to cooperate; major sanctions coordination pointing to FATF action.\n\nWhat would move me down: Pre-plenary statements reaffirming status quo; signals that Pakistan’s file is being handled via routine follow-up/grey-list channels; or reporting that progress reviews for current blacklisted jurisdictions are unchanged without indications of imminent removal.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"black list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Financial Action Task Force blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force_blacklist)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action\" list, which at the time of this question consists of North Korea, Myanmar and Iran. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIndian government officials announced in May 2025 their intention to submit fresh intelligence to the FATF concerning terrorist infrastructure operating within Pakistan. This development follows Pakistan's removal from the FATF Grey List in October 2022. At the time of its removal, the FATF noted that Pakistan should continue working with the Asia Pacific Group (APG) to improve its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing systems.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
