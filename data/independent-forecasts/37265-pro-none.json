    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The US State Department's travel advisory for Tanzania will remain at its current 'Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution' or lower.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security and political situation in Tanzania continues on its current trajectory. While known risks from crime and terrorism persist, no single major incident or widespread deterioration of security occurs that would compel the State Department to escalate its warning to 'Reconsider Travel'. The advisory remains at Level 2 through the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant negative event occurs, such as a major terrorist attack targeting tourists or Western interests in a major city like Dar es Salaam, Arusha, or on Zanzibar. Alternatively, a significant spillover of violent conflict from the Cabo Delgado region of Mozambique into southern Tanzania, or a sudden, violent political crisis, could trigger a rapid reassessment and upgrade to Level 3.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong tendency for bureaucratic assessments like travel advisories to remain unchanged absent a significant catalyst. The current advisory for Tanzania is 'Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,' which already accounts for the existing risks of crime and terrorism noted in the provided background information. For an upgrade to 'Level 3: Reconsider Travel' to occur, the State Department would need to perceive a substantial and widespread increase in risk to U.S. citizens. The timeframe for this question is very short—less than two months. While a high-impact event like a terrorist attack is possible, the probability of such an event occurring within this specific, narrow window is low. The status quo is the most probable outcome.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 15% because Level 2 is the appropriate advisory for the current, known risks. Inertia is a strong factor, and there are no current indicators of a rapidly deteriorating situation that would guarantee an upgrade in the next eight weeks. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 15% because the underlying risks are real and unpredictable. The terrorism threat, particularly related to instability in neighboring Mozambique, represents a persistent, low-probability, high-impact risk. A single, significant incident targeting foreigners could be sufficient to trigger a rapid change in the advisory level.\n\nI would increase my probability forecast upon receiving credible reports of a major terrorist attack, a significant escalation of violence in southern Tanzania, or the emergence of widespread political instability or civil unrest. Conversely, as the July 1, 2025 deadline approaches without any aformentioned incident, my confidence in a 'No' outcome would increase.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Tanzania receive a \"Level 3 – Reconsider Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Travel Advisory for Tanzania: How Increased Crime and Terrorism Threats Impact Tourists in Popular African Destinations](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/travel-advisory-for-tanzania-how-increased-crime-and-terrorism-threats-impact-tourists-in-popular-african-destinations/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Tanzania has received a Level 3 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Tanzania.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
