    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current US State Department travel advisory for Tanzania is Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security and political situation in Tanzania remains relatively stable through June 2025. Crime and terrorism risks persist at current levels but do not escalate in a way that would compel the US State Department to raise the country-wide advisory from Level 2 to Level 3.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant deterioration in the security environment occurs, such as a large-scale terrorist attack in a major city or tourist area like Dar es Salaam or Zanzibar, a notable spike in violent crime targeting Westerners, or the outbreak of significant political violence, prompting the State Department to upgrade the advisory to 'Reconsider Travel'.",
    "rationale": "The current US State Department travel advisory for Tanzania is Level 2: 'Exercise Increased Caution,' primarily due to risks of crime, terrorism, and health issues. My forecast of 15% leans heavily on the principle that the status quo is the most likely outcome over a short time frame, as bureaucratic assessments like travel advisories tend to have significant inertia. The existing Level 2 advisory already accounts for the known risks of crime and terrorism mentioned in the background information, meaning conditions would need to worsen demonstrably to trigger an upgrade. The primary catalyst for a change to Level 3 would be a high-profile, unexpected event. While the risk of terrorism exists, particularly spillover from regional conflicts (e.g., Mozambique), a major attack on tourist centers has not occurred recently and is a low-probability, high-impact event. The next general election is in late 2025, after the resolution date, so while pre-election tensions could rise, the peak risk period is likely outside the forecast window. My forecast is not lower than 15% because the underlying risks are real and the security situation in the region is volatile. An isolated but severe incident is entirely plausible and would be sufficient to cause a change in the advisory. My forecast is not higher because there is currently no specific intelligence or escalating pattern of events to suggest that a change is imminent within the next two months. I would raise my probability if there were reports of specific terrorist threats against tourist areas, a sudden increase in violent crime targeting foreigners, or a significant and early escalation of election-related civil unrest. I would lower it if regional stability improved or Tanzanian security forces conducted successful, high-profile counter-terrorism operations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Tanzania receive a \"Level 3 – Reconsider Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Travel Advisory for Tanzania: How Increased Crime and Terrorism Threats Impact Tourists in Popular African Destinations](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/travel-advisory-for-tanzania-how-increased-crime-and-terrorism-threats-impact-tourists-in-popular-african-destinations/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Tanzania has received a Level 3 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Tanzania.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
