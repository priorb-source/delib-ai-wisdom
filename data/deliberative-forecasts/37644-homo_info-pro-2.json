    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters, with probabilities ranging from 2-5%. We all agree that the primary drivers for a low forecast are the extremely short six-week timeframe and the complete absence of typical pre-IPO signals like media leaks or reports of hiring underwriters. Forecaster 2 introduced a crucial point I had not fully weighted: a massive, very recent funding round in March 2025, which negates any immediate financial imperative to go public. They also convincingly argued that strategic investors like Amazon and Google likely prefer Anthropic to remain private to maintain long-term strategic alignment. Forecaster 3 provided a useful framework by referencing the low base rate for venture-backed decacorn IPOs in any given short period, which further reinforces the unlikelihood of this event.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 3%. After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast to 2%. Their arguments were highly persuasive and strengthened the case for a 'No' outcome. I was particularly convinced by two points. First, as Forecaster 2 noted, Anthropic just raised $3.5 billion in March 2025. A company that is this well-capitalized has no urgent financial need to undertake a complex and distracting IPO process in the next six weeks. Second, Forecaster 2's argument that major strategic investors (Amazon, Google) would likely prefer Anthropic to stay private to avoid the quarterly pressures of public markets and focus on long-term R&D is a powerful one. These factors, combined with my original reasoning about the short timeline and lack of public signals, and Forecaster 3's point about the low base rate, make the probability even lower than I first estimated. The chance is not zero due to the possibility of a highly secret preparation process, but the combined weight of the evidence against an announcement before July 1 is overwhelming.",
