  "information": "Colombia has declared a national health and economic emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, reports indicate 79 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since September 2024, with a case fatality rate cited as approximately 45-50%. The government has ordered a mass vaccination campaign and requires travelers to high-risk areas, and those arriving from certain countries like Brazil and Ecuador, to present a yellow fever vaccination card. The Ministry of Health has identified over 400 municipalities as being at 'high' or 'very high' risk.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 2 \"Practice Enhanced Precautions\" travel notice for yellow fever in South America in April 2025, which includes Colombia. This notice advises travelers to get vaccinated. Historically, the CDC has not elevated yellow fever outbreaks beyond Level 2, even during larger epidemics such as those in Brazil (2017–18, with over 2,000 cases) and Nigeria (2019). Level 3 notices are typically reserved for situations with sustained urban transmission, overwhelmed healthcare capacity, or for diseases where risk cannot be mitigated by standard measures like vaccination.\n\nThe current yellow fever outbreak in Colombia is primarily concentrated in rural departments with low tourist traffic, such as Tolima and Putumayo. As of late April 2025, there have been no verified cases of urban transmission in major cities like Bogotá, Medellín, or Cartagena. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has reported a total of 131 cases and 53 deaths across the Americas in the first three months of 2025, with cases primarily found in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. While neighboring countries have issued alerts, they have not implemented entry bans.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — CDC keeps Colombia at Level 2 as of June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Yellow fever transmission remains largely sylvatic and concentrated in rural departments with low tourist traffic; no verified sustained urban transmission in major cities; Colombia’s vaccination campaign expands; PAHO/CDC reports show stable or declining case counts; CDC maintains a regional Level 2 notice advising vaccination rather than issuing a country-specific Level 3.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sustained urban transmission is confirmed in a major city (e.g., Bogotá, Medellín, Cali, Cartagena) with a clear upward trajectory in cases and deaths, and/or vaccine access constraints or health system strain make mitigation via routine precautions/vaccination inadequate, prompting CDC to issue a country-specific Level 3 “Avoid Nonessential Travel” notice for Colombia before June 1 (which would still be in effect when checked on or after June 1). Alternatively, another severe health threat (e.g., a high-consequence outbreak) emerges in Colombia and drives a Level 3 notice.",
    "rationale": "I interpret resolution per the stated criterion: the outcome is Yes if CDC’s Travel Health Notice for Colombia is >2 (i.e., Level 3 or higher) when checked on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nKey facts from the research assistant:\n- Colombia declared a national health/economic emergency due to yellow fever; ~79 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since Sep 2024 (high CFR typical of reported severe YF cases), concentrated in rural departments; >400 municipalities labeled high/very high risk. Mass vaccination campaign underway and proof-of-vaccination requirements for certain travelers.\n- CDC issued a Level 2 regional notice (“Practice Enhanced Precautions”) for yellow fever in South America in April 2025, advising vaccination.\n- Historically, CDC has not raised yellow fever outbreaks beyond Level 2, even during larger epidemics (e.g., Brazil 2017–18, Nigeria 2019). Level 3 is generally reserved for situations such as sustained urban transmission, overwhelmed healthcare capacity, or threats not readily mitigated by vaccination.\n- As of late April, no verified urban transmission in major Colombian cities; PAHO reports 131 cases and 53 deaths across the Americas in Q1 2025, mainly Brazil, Colombia, Peru. Neighboring countries issued alerts but no entry bans.\n\nReasoning:\n- Base rates and CDC practice: For vaccine-preventable vector-borne diseases like yellow fever, CDC almost always uses Level 2 with strong vaccination advice; Level 3 is uncommon and typically tied to urban transmission and/or inability to mitigate risk. Even far larger YF outbreaks in Brazil did not lead to a Level 3 Travel Health Notice.\n- Current epidemiology: Outbreak appears predominantly sylvatic and rural, with no verified urban spread in major travel hubs. That substantially reduces the likelihood of a rapid CDC escalation within the next ~5–6 weeks.\n- Time horizon: With roughly 39 days left, a shift to Level 3 would require both a material epidemiological change (e.g., confirmed sustained urban transmission) and CDC action before June 1 such that the notice is Level 3 when checked on/after that date. That combination is possible but unlikely.\n\nWhy not higher: A national emergency and high-risk municipalities widen the concern, but without sustained urban transmission or a vaccine access crisis, CDC precedent points strongly to maintaining Level 2. The short time window further constrains the chance of a Level 3 change.\n\nWhy not lower: Non-zero risk remains because yellow fever could spill into urban Aedes aegypti cycles, or a broader health system strain/vaccine access problem could arise, prompting CDC to consider a higher level.\n\nWhat would move me upward:\n- Confirmed sustained urban transmission with multiple autochthonous cases in a major city; significant week-over-week case growth; reports of ICU/health system strain; credible reports of U.S./global YF vaccine shortages limiting traveler vaccination; CDC/PAHO advisories explicitly signaling potential elevation.\n\nWhat would move me downward:\n- Continued absence of urban cases through mid-May; evidence of effective vaccination rollout and stable or declining incidence; CDC updates reaffirming a regional Level 2 approach without country-specific elevation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
