  "information": "A high-level international conference on the two-state solution is scheduled for June 17-20, 2025, at the UN headquarters in New York. The conference is co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia and is based on a UN General Assembly resolution from December 2024. Its stated aim is to generate momentum for more countries to recognize a Palestinian state. Supporting this effort, the Arab Group at the UN has urged member countries to recognize Palestine as a step toward lasting peace. Additionally, the 'Madrid+' group, comprising Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and Norway, has called for Palestine's full UN membership, describing it as a \"political and diplomatic necessity.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has stated that recognizing a Palestinian state is a \"moral and political obligation\" and has indicated that France may officially grant recognition during the June UN conference, although he has also tied the move to certain conditions. In May 2025, the UK announced it had joined France's initiative for the recognition of a Palestinian state. According to a report by Axios, Malta is also preparing to declare Palestine's independence at the summit on June 20. Five Arab countries—Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia—have announced their active participation in organizing the conference.\n\nAs of May 2025, 147 out of 193 UN member states officially recognize the State of Palestine, while 46 members do not. The non-recognizing states include most Western European nations, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea. In 2024, five countries newly recognized Palestine: Norway, Ireland, Spain, Slovenia, and Armenia. The Israeli government strongly opposes the international recognition effort. An Israeli official stated the country \"will not cooperate\" with such measures and warned of potential further annexation of the West Bank. The United States and several other G7 members also continue to withhold official recognition.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "30 days - the resolution window is June 1-30, 2025, and today is May 31, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the default outcome is that no UN member country announces recognition of Palestine during June 2025, as diplomatic recognition is a significant governmental action that requires formal procedures and changes slowly",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the high-profile June 17-20 conference and stated intentions from several countries, no formal recognition announcements materialize in June. France delays due to unmet conditions, Malta postpones its announcement, and other countries prefer to wait for further diplomatic coordination. The conference produces supportive statements but no official recognition declarations within the June timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "During or around the June 17-20 UN conference, at least one country follows through on stated intentions. Malta announces recognition on June 20 as reported by Axios, or France formally recognizes Palestine during the conference as suggested by Macron's statements, or another country (UK, another European nation, or an Arab state) makes an official announcement. The conference provides political cover and momentum for formal action.",
    "rationale": "This forecast weighs several competing factors. Strong positive indicators include: (1) a specific high-profile conference scheduled for June 17-20 with the explicit purpose of generating recognition momentum, (2) concrete reporting from Axios that Malta plans to announce on June 20, (3) French President Macron's statements calling recognition a 'moral and political obligation' and indicating potential announcement during the June conference, (4) UK joining France's initiative in May 2025, and (5) historical precedent of 5 countries recognizing Palestine in 2024. The timing is highly specific and deliberate, with the conference designed as a catalyst. However, significant countervailing factors exist: Macron tied recognition to 'certain conditions' suggesting it's not guaranteed, diplomatic actions frequently face delays even with stated intent, strong opposition from Israel and non-recognition by the U.S. and most G7 members creates diplomatic pressure, and governments inherently move slowly on major diplomatic steps. The key insight is that the question only requires ONE country to announce recognition during June, and with multiple countries signaling intent around a specific conference, the probability is elevated well above the status quo baseline. The Axios report about Malta is particularly concrete. However, I'm not forecasting above 70% because diplomatic timelines often slip and stated intentions don't always translate to action within specific timeframes. I'm not forecasting below 55% because the convergence of the conference timing, multiple specific signals, and the low bar of needing just one announcement creates meaningful probability. I would update higher if: additional countries explicitly announce June recognition plans, or if Malta or France make more definitive statements. I would update lower if: key countries walk back their signals, the conference gets postponed, or significant diplomatic obstacles emerge.",
