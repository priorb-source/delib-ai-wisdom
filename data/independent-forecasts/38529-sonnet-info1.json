  "information": "A series of polls conducted between March and June 2025 show Andrew Cuomo as the frontrunner in the Democratic primary. A SurveyUSA poll in May showed Cuomo as the first choice for 43% of likely Democratic voters, with Zohran Mamdani at 11%. A Marist poll from early May placed Cuomo at 37% and Mamdani at 18%, and a simulation showed Cuomo surpassing the 50% threshold to win in the fifth round of ranked-choice voting. An Emerson College/PIX11/The Hill poll from late May placed Cuomo at 39% to Mamdani's 23%. Earlier polls from March by Honan Strategy Group and Data for Progress also showed Cuomo leading Mamdani with 41% to 18% and 39% to 15%, respectively.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "15 days until the Democratic primary on June 24, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Andrew Cuomo wins the Democratic primary based on consistent polling leads",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Zohran Mamdani's momentum continues accelerating in the final two weeks, consolidating progressive voters and younger demographics. Late-breaking negative news about Cuomo or a strong debate performance by Mamdani shifts sufficient voters in the ranked-choice voting rounds to deny Cuomo the nomination.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cuomo maintains his polling lead through election day. His name recognition, establishment support, and strong first-choice position hold firm. The ranked-choice voting simulation from Marist proves accurate, with Cuomo crossing the 50% threshold as predicted.",
    "rationale": "The polling data strongly favors Cuomo winning. Five separate polls from March through late May 2025 consistently show him leading with 37-43% support compared to Mamdani's 11-23%. This represents a comfortable 16-32 point lead depending on the poll. The Marist simulation specifically modeled ranked-choice voting and projected Cuomo surpassing 50% in the fifth round, which is particularly relevant given NYC's voting system. However, several factors prevent higher confidence: First, the headline indicates Cuomo's lead is narrowing with Mamdani gaining ground - the gap closed from 32 points in May SurveyUSA to 16 points in late May Emerson. Second, 15 days remains until the primary, enough time for significant shifts especially with motivated opposition. Third, Cuomo carries historical baggage from his 2021 gubernatorial resignation. Fourth, ranked-choice voting can produce surprises if second and third choices break unexpectedly. Fifth, youth turnout or enthusiasm gaps could differ from polling models. I would update higher with newer polls maintaining his lead or early voting data confirming his advantage. I would update lower with continued narrowing in polls, major negative news, or signs of unexpectedly high progressive turnout. The status quo strongly favors Cuomo, but the narrowing trend and remaining time warrant meaningful uncertainty.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
