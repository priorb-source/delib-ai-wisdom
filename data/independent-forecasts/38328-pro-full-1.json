  "information": "A lobbying scandal involving Huawei has led to a probe by Belgian prosecutors. On June 5, 2025, EPP MEP Fulvio Martusciello was arrested in connection with the investigation. Authorities have also requested that the parliamentary immunity be lifted for at least four other MEPs. The Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs was expected to vote on these immunity waivers in mid-June, with the full plenary potentially confirming the decision during its session from June 16-19. Citing the precedent set during the 'Qatargate' scandal, major political groups like the EPP, S&D, and Renew have signaled zero-tolerance positions on corruption.\n\nHistorically, the 705-seat European Parliament sees between 80 and 120 replacements over a five-year term, which averages to approximately 1-2 departures per month. This turnover can be due to a variety of reasons, including appointments to national posts, retirement, scandals, or health issues. The rate of departures is often higher during the first year of a new parliamentary term. Precedents from previous scandals are mixed; while events like 'Qatargate' did lead to resignations, some indicted MEPs, such as Eva Kaili and Marc Tarabella, resisted calls to step down for several months while legal proceedings were ongoing.\n\nResignations from the European Parliament frequently occur when a sitting MEP is appointed to a ministerial position within their national government. Following elections in several member states, new governments were in the process of being formed. Specifically, after the May 18 elections in Portugal, there were rumors that at least two MEPs were being considered for cabinet positions in the new government. Other countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, also had fluid political circumstances that could lead to cabinet reshuffles.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The MEPs implicated in the Huawei scandal legally contest the charges and retain their seats pending the outcome of the investigation, similar to precedents set during the 'Qatargate' scandal. Coincidentally, no other MEPs resign for unrelated reasons (e.g., national appointments, health) during the narrow 21-day resolution window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An MEP implicated in the Huawei scandal, such as the recently arrested Fulvio Martusciello, resigns under intense political pressure from their party group following the vote to lift parliamentary immunity in mid-June. Alternatively, a different MEP resigns to take up a ministerial post in a new national government, or a resignation occurs for personal or health reasons, in line with historical turnover.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on three main factors: the historical base rate of resignations, the acute pressure from the ongoing Huawei scandal, and the possibility of appointments to national governments.\n\nFirst, the base rate of turnover in the European Parliament is significant. With 80-120 MEPs being replaced over a five-year term, the monthly average is between 1.3 and 2. A simple Poisson distribution calculation based on this average suggests a roughly 65% chance of at least one resignation occurring in any given 21-day period. This alone makes 'Yes' the more probable outcome.\n\nSecond, the Huawei scandal acts as a powerful catalyst that concentrates the probability of a resignation within the resolution window. The arrest of one MEP and the impending votes on lifting the immunity of four others in mid-June create a crisis point. Major political groups have signaled a 'zero-tolerance' policy, increasing pressure for implicated members to step down immediately to mitigate political damage, a lesson learned from the protracted 'Qatargate' affair.\n\nThird, unrelated political dynamics provide another independent pathway to a 'Yes' outcome. The formation of new national governments, particularly in Portugal, often leads to MEPs resigning to take up cabinet positions. This possibility further elevates the probability of a resignation in late June.\n\nMy probability is not higher because MEPs facing legal trouble have a strong incentive to retain their parliamentary immunity and have historically resisted calls to resign for months. The political and legal processes can be slower than expected.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the base rate of resignations is already high, and the Huawei scandal provides a specific, timely, and high-profile reason for an immediate resignation. The confluence of these independent factors makes it highly likely that at least one MEP will resign before July 1.\n\nI would increase my forecast if a major political group formally expels an implicated MEP or if reliable reports confirm an MEP's impending appointment to a national cabinet. I would decrease it if the parliamentary votes on immunity are postponed past July 1 or if implicated MEPs receive strong public backing from their party leadership to remain in their posts.",
