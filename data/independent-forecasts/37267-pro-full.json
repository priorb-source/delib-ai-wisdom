  "information": "Ethiopia's travel advisory from the US State Department is currently 'Level 3 – Reconsider Travel'. This was confirmed by multiple news reports from early May 2025 and a review on April 30, 2025, which did not place Ethiopia on the list of 21 countries with a 'Level 4' advisory. The State Department last downgraded Ethiopia from Level 4 to Level 3 in early 2023. While the nationwide advisory is Level 3, specific regions within Ethiopia, including Tigray and parts of Amhara, Oromia, Gambella, and Benishangul-Gumuz, carry a Level 4 warning due to localized conflicts.\n\nThe US State Department advisory system has four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). As of early May 2025, 21 countries were under a Level 4 advisory for reasons including terrorism, civil unrest, war, and health emergencies. Historically, out of the 25–35 countries typically at Level 3, only 2–4 are upgraded to Level 4 in a given year. Upgrades from Level 3 to Level 4 often follow clear catalysts such as coups, invasions, airport closures, hostage incidents involving foreigners, or the ordered departure of non-essential U.S. embassy staff.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, the U.S. announced sanctions related to renewed violence in the Tigray and Amhara regions. Ethiopia has neighboring countries, specifically Sudan and South Sudan, that are already under a Level 4 advisory. As of early May 2025, there have been no reports of a new nationwide offensive, a coup attempt, or a mass-casualty event involving foreigners since the sanctions were announced.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The US State Department travel advisory for Ethiopia will remain at Level 3 or lower.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing, contained regional conflicts in Ethiopia persist without a significant nationwide escalation. The security situation in the capital, Addis Ababa, remains stable, and US embassy operations continue without interruption, leading the State Department to maintain the country-wide Level 3 advisory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant escalation of conflict, such as a major offensive threatening Addis Ababa, a successful coup d'état, or a mass-casualty event involving foreigners, prompts the State Department to order the departure of non-essential embassy personnel and issue a nationwide 'Level 4 – Do Not Travel' advisory.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of a low probability is primarily based on the high threshold for a Level 4 advisory and the short timeframe. The status quo is a Level 3 advisory, which was reaffirmed in a late April 2025 review. Bureaucratic and geopolitical inertia make rapid changes to country-wide advisories unlikely without a dramatic catalyst. Historically, only 2-4 of the 25-35 countries at Level 3 are elevated to Level 4 in an entire year, suggesting a low base rate of escalation. For Ethiopia, this would require a severe deterioration of the national security situation beyond the existing regional conflicts, which are already accounted for with specific Level 4 warnings for those areas. The capital, Addis Ababa, would likely need to be directly threatened, or a major event like a coup or the closure of the international airport would have to occur. There are no current indicators of such an imminent event. My probability is not lower than 10% because the situation is volatile. The recent US sanctions (May 1, 2025) and active conflicts in multiple regions create a tangible risk of rapid escalation. The instability in neighboring Level 4 countries like Sudan also presents a potential spillover risk. I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of a new nationwide military offensive, a coup attempt, or an ordered departure of US embassy staff. I would decrease it if meaningful de-escalation or peace talks were announced regarding the conflicts in the Amhara and Tigray regions.",
