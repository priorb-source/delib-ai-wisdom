    "review": "All three forecasters converged remarkably at 70-72%, which increases my confidence that we're identifying the key factors correctly. Both forecasters emphasized points I had considered: the February 2025 precedent, the large number of jurisdictions (25), the low bar for resolution (ANY change), and FATF's regular three-meeting cycle. Forecaster 3 raised two particularly valuable counterpoints: (1) the status quo bias should be respected more strongly, and (2) only 3-4 months between February and June may not provide sufficient time for dramatic progress. This second point is well-taken - if the February meeting already processed the most ready candidates, June might see less activity. Both forecasters also explicitly noted that not every plenary results in changes, which is an important base rate consideration. However, I note that neither forecaster provided contrary evidence to the strong precedent of the February changes, nor did they identify specific reasons to expect June to be different from typical plenaries. The convergence of our forecasts around 70-72% suggests this range appropriately balances the evidence for active list management against uncertainty about timing and progress rates.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I maintain confidence in my original reasoning. The key factors remain: (1) Strong recent precedent from February 2025 showing active list management, (2) 25 jurisdictions providing multiple opportunities for change, (3) Low resolution bar of ANY change (addition OR removal), (4) FATF's three-meeting annual cycle making June a regular decision point. Forecaster 3's emphasis on status quo bias and the short 3-4 month window is valid and prevents me from going higher. However, I don't find it compelling enough to lower my forecast because: the February changes demonstrate ongoing momentum, not all monitored jurisdictions are on the same timeline, and new additions can occur independently of existing jurisdictions' progress. The question structure is crucial - we only need one change out of 25+ potential opportunities (25 current plus any new candidates). If this asked about a specific jurisdiction, I'd forecast much lower. The convergence at 70-72% across all forecasters validates this range as appropriately calibrated between optimism about FATF activity and respect for uncertainty.",
