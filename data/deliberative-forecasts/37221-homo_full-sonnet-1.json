    "review": "All three analyses are remarkably well-aligned in both reasoning and conclusions. Forecasters 2 and 3 independently arrived at 23%, while I estimated 25% - a trivial difference. We all identified the same key factors: the clear downward trend (2.3% → 2.2%), the 2.1% consensus forecast below threshold, multiple disinflationary drivers (ECB rate cuts, weak PMI, decelerating wages, energy deflation), and appropriate uncertainty factors (proximity to threshold, services inflation persistence, consensus forecast error ranges). Forecaster 3's emphasis on the reliability of near-term consensus forecasts is particularly well-taken - professional forecasters rarely miss by more than 0.1-0.2 percentage points at this short horizon, and the consensus specifically predicts 2.1%, which is 0.1 percentage points below the 2.2% threshold. No forecaster raised substantive new information or arguments I hadn't considered. The convergence at 23% across two independent analyses suggests careful calibration of the probability given the consensus forecast accuracy and the small margin between March's 2.2% reading and April's expected 2.1%. The 2 percentage point difference between my 25% and their 23% is negligible and likely reflects minor variations in how we're weighting forecast uncertainty versus the strength of the disinflationary trend.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the convergence of two independent forecasters at 23% provides a useful calibration check. The key insight is balancing the strong disinflationary fundamentals and below-threshold consensus forecast against appropriate uncertainty. Given that: (1) consensus forecasts at 1-month horizons typically have errors of 0.1-0.2 percentage points, (2) the consensus predicts 2.1% which is 0.1pp below the 2.2% threshold, (3) March was exactly at 2.2%, and (4) all structural factors support continued disinflation, a probability around 23-25% appropriately reflects the chance of an upside surprise. The core reasoning remains unchanged: this is likely to resolve No, but not with overwhelming certainty due to forecast uncertainty and the proximity to the threshold. I'll adjust slightly to 23% to reflect the independent convergence and acknowledge that this may represent a more careful calibration of consensus forecast reliability.",
