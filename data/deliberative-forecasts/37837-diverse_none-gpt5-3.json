    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds concrete recent month and June-by-June figures (June: 1106 in 2020, 434 in 2021, 340 in 2022, 267 in 2023; recent months <350), which I hadn’t explicitly cited. That strengthens the case that the current baseline is well under 400 absent a catalyst. Their trend-based argument is persuasive and aligns with my priors about declining post-2020 spikes. Forecaster 3 assumes a higher baseline without recent data and sets 55% largely on general considerations; that’s not convincing given the specific downward data for 2022–2023 and reported sub-350 months in 2023–2024. I find Forecaster 2’s evidence-based approach more credible than Forecaster 3’s assumption-driven even-odds framing.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Recent NUFORC data cited by Forecaster 2 indicates June totals have been below 400 in 2022–2023 and that most months in 2023–early 2024 were under 350, implying a current baseline below the threshold. To clear 400 likely requires a distinct spike event. Catalysts: June seasonality (more outdoor activity), ongoing Starlink deployments with favorable visibility, and elevated solar activity (potential low-latitude aurora) all create a meaningful right tail; a widely visible Starlink train, bright reentry/fireball, or strong geomagnetic storm could push reports over 400. Offsets: Public familiarity with Starlink moderates extreme surges, and absent a specific known catalyst, the recent trend suggests sub-400 is more likely. Resolution timing (counts as displayed on/after July 1) also slightly reduces the chance if NUFORC’s posting lags. Net: Forecaster 2’s concrete trend data nudges me slightly down from my prior 33% to 31%, retaining a nontrivial tail for spike scenarios in June.",
