  "information": "A proposal to ban the 'Tush Push' play, initially submitted by the Green Bay Packers, was discussed at the NFL's annual meeting in early April 2025. The proposal was tabled after receiving support from 16 of the NFL's 32 teams, short of the 24 votes required to pass a rule change. The proposal is scheduled to be revisited at the spring league meeting on May 20-21, 2025, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nMultiple reports indicate that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell favors the ban. Goodell has stated that the play 'feels more like rugby' than football and that returning to pre-2005 rules that banned pushing players 'makes a lot of sense.' The NFL league office also reportedly wants to eliminate the play. Additionally, the NFL's Competition Committee and health and safety officials, including Dr. Allen Sills, have expressed concerns about the play's potential for injury.\n\nThe original proposal is being reworked into a broader rule that would prohibit pushing or pulling a ball carrier anywhere on the field, not just in the specific quarterback sneak formation. This change aims to frame the issue around general football principles rather than targeting a specific team. On the other hand, the NFL's health and safety department possesses no data indicating any injuries have occurred from the 'Tush Push'. The Philadelphia Eagles, who have used the play with a high success rate, have vocally opposed the ban.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "19 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At the NFL spring league meeting on May 20-21, 2025, the reworked proposal to ban pushing or pulling a ball carrier fails to secure the required 24 votes from team owners. Lacking sufficient support, no ban is enacted before the June 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "During the NFL spring league meeting on May 20-21, 2025, a reworked, broader proposal to ban pushing or pulling a ball carrier receives 24 or more votes. The rule change is officially announced by the league before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The primary factor driving this forecast is the significant institutional momentum behind the ban. The support of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, the league office, and the Competition Committee represents a powerful coalition actively pushing for this change. The initial proposal in April 2025 secured 16 votes, establishing a strong base of support. The subsequent decision to reframe the proposal as a broader ban on pushing any ball carrier, rather than specifically targeting the 'Tush Push', is a savvy political move that could persuade owners who were concerned about targeting a single team's successful strategy. The proximity of the upcoming vote on May 20-21 indicates this is a high-priority issue the league intends to resolve swiftly. \n\nHowever, the probability is not higher because the 24-vote threshold (a 75% supermajority) is a formidable barrier. Gaining eight additional votes in just over a month is a significant challenge. The strongest counterargument is the lack of empirical data showing the 'Tush Push' causes a higher rate of injury, which undermines the primary health and safety justification for the ban. Teams that have successfully utilized the play, like the Philadelphia Eagles, will continue to lobby fiercely against a change that negates their competitive advantage. \n\nThe forecast is not lower because the combination of a 50% initial support level, a full-court press from the league's most powerful figures, and a more palatable, reframed proposal makes a 'Yes' outcome more likely than not. The momentum is clearly with the proponents of the ban.\n\nI would increase my forecast with credible reports that influential owners have switched their position to 'Yes' or that the league has presented new compelling data. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if reports emerged of a growing coalition of owners organizing to defeat the proposal.",
