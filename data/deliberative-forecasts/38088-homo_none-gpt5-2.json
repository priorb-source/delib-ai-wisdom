    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my base-rate framing and the weight on the most recent observation (Apr 30 non-U.S.). Forecaster 2 adds a useful emphasis on a lower base-rate band (30–35%) for U.S. representation specifically around the mid-ranks, which I find slightly more plausible than Forecaster 3’s broader 35–45% range. The point about Devasini’s crypto-linked wealth increases volatility but is not directionally favorable to a U.S. occupant at exactly #250 on a fixed date. The recurring focus on the 245–255 cluster composition as a key update trigger is sound; we currently lack that evidence. Overall, their arguments reinforce a modest tilt below 40% and closer to the low-to-mid 30s absent fresh data.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is about one month, so daily churn could move the #250 slot but not in a way that systematically favors the U.S. The best base rate for a random mid-list slot looks closer to 30–35% U.S., and the latest concrete snapshot is non-U.S. (Devasini, Italy). Macro factors (U.S. equities, USD) could provide a small upside nudge, but without evidence of a U.S.-heavy cluster around ranks 245–255, the status-quo non-U.S. occupant and the sub-50% U.S. share near the median argue for a probability in the mid-30s or slightly lower. Incorporating Forecaster 2’s tighter base-rate band and giving modest extra weight to the current non-U.S. observation, I trim my estimate slightly from 38% to 35%.",
