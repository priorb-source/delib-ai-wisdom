    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: small, tightly regulated island market; recent government enforcement posture; active local ride-hailing alternatives; no pre-launch signals from Uber. I agree with their emphasis on the feasibility of an “Uber Taxi” integration as the only fast path. The main point I’d push back on is the suggestion of a pre–peak-season impetus: TCI’s peak tourism is typically winter (roughly Dec–Apr), so a July launch is not especially time-critical, which weakens the upside scenario. Neither forecaster introduced concrete new evidence (e.g., regulatory filings, partnership chatter, job postings) that would materially raise odds. Overall, their arguments are coherent but don’t shift my view.",
    "rationale": "Status quo (no Uber) is strongly favored: (1) April 2025 government warnings and fines against illegal taxis signal protective regulation and alignment with licensed/local solutions, not a rush to onboard a global platform; (2) two local ride-hailing apps (GetMe Ride; Conch Cab just launched) reduce any perceived gap that Uber would fill; (3) Uber’s recent expansion efforts focus on larger markets and structured partnerships; TCI’s small population and limited road network make it a low-priority deployment; (4) lack of any telltale pre-launch signals (press, MOUs, website/app breadcrumbs, local media leaks, hiring) with only ~60 days left; and (5) July is off-peak relative to TCI’s high season, lowering urgency for a hurried rollout. The only plausible quick path is an “Uber Taxi” integration with licensed drivers, but there’s no public indication of talks or a policy shift to enable it. Given the short timeline and the strong status quo forces, I maintain a low but nonzero tail for a surprise partnership-driven launch.",
