    "review": "Both forecasters present important concrete information I lacked. Forecaster 2 provides a specific recent range (215,000-235,000) with central tendency slightly above 220,000, while Forecaster 3 confirms the 4-week average hovers near or slightly above 220k. This is critically different from my initial assumption of a 210,000-215,000 average. Both also note gradual labor market cooling—Forecaster 2 cites restrictive monetary policy and moderating demand, while Forecaster 3 mentions rising continuing claims and slowed hiring. Forecaster 3's point about 1-5k routine revisions is also relevant given the tight threshold. However, Forecaster 3's observation that many recent weeks printed at or below 220k suggests considerable volatility around this level, tempering confidence in either direction.",
    "rationale": "I need to significantly update my forecast upward. My initial 42% was anchored on an incorrect assumption that the recent average was 210-215k, which would naturally produce lower probability of exceeding 220k. If the actual central tendency is at or slightly above 220k (as both forecasters indicate), then basic probability should start near 50%, not 42%. The gradual cooling trend both forecasters cite—driven by high interest rates, moderating demand, rising continuing claims, and slower hiring—provides directional bias toward exceeding the threshold. However, the high week-to-week volatility and Forecaster 3's note that many recent weeks printed below 220k prevents me from going as high as 60%. The threshold requiring strict exceeding (not meeting or exceeding) also matters marginally. Balancing these factors, I'm updating to 55%—acknowledging the recent average is very close to 220k, the cooling trend adds a modest upward bias, but volatility keeps uncertainty high.",
