    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 27 days. The 2025 Surinamese general election is scheduled for May 25, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Progressive Reform Party (VHP) wins the most seats, similar to the 2020 election when they secured 20 out of 51 seats in the National Assembly and formed the current government under President Chan Santokhi.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The National Democratic Party (NDP) successfully rebounds from Desi Bouterse's legal troubles and criminal conviction, capitalizing on economic dissatisfaction with the current VHP-led government. Alternatively, a different party or coalition emerges as the plurality winner due to fragmentation of the VHP's traditional Indo-Surinamese base or voter dissatisfaction with incumbent performance.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The VHP maintains its position as the largest party by successfully campaigning on its record of democratic governance after the Bouterse era, benefits from continued weakness of the NDP following Bouterse's conviction, and retains support from its traditional base while the opposition remains divided among multiple parties.",
    "rationale": "The VHP currently holds incumbent advantage as the leading party in the 2020-2025 government period. Status quo bias suggests continuity is likely, especially so close to election day when major shifts become less probable. The VHP won 20 seats in 2020, making them the plurality party, and their main rival NDP has been significantly weakened by Bouterse's murder conviction in 2019 and his subsequent legal troubles. However, several factors create uncertainty: (1) No specific polling data is available to confirm current support levels; (2) Economic challenges in Suriname may have eroded support for the incumbent government; (3) Suriname has historically seen competitive multi-party elections with seat distribution shifting between elections; (4) With only 27 days until voting, normal campaign dynamics have largely played out, but last-minute developments remain possible. The forecast is not higher because incumbent governments often face headwinds from governance challenges, and without recent polling showing a clear VHP lead, overconfidence is unwarranted. The forecast is not lower because the status quo deserves weight, the opposition NDP faces structural challenges, and dramatic reversals are less common this close to election day. I would update upward with: polling showing strong VHP leads, visible collapse of opposition parties, or major scandals affecting rivals. I would update downward with: polling showing VHP trailing, evidence of significant economic voter discontent, or major campaign setbacks for the VHP.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Progressive Reform Party of Suriname wins a plurality of seats in the [2025 Surinamese general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Surinamese_general_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
