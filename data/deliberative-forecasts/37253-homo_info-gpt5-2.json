    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce a low short-horizon probability, adding a few specifics I hadn’t explicitly cited: (1) recent 38 North imagery reportedly showing no last‑mile preparations at Punggye‑ri; (2) a seasonality point—tests clustering in Jan/Feb and September with only one in late spring (May 2009); (3) IAEA’s continued nuclear material production and program expansion; and (4) the site’s assessed operational status per ROK NIS/U.S. assessments. I already factored in capability and the seven‑plus‑year pause, but the explicit 38 North read strengthens the “no imminent prep” case. Their notes on Russia ties/weak UN enforcement marginally lowering the external cost of testing are sensible and already in my frame (I referenced greater Chinese/Russian tolerance), but do not overcome the lack of proximate indicators. I find their reasoning largely convincing and aligned with my prior view, with a slightly higher emphasis on seasonality and imagery.\n",
    "rationale": "Time left is ~61 days. The baseline since 2017 is no test, and open‑source indicators of imminent testing (sustained activity at Punggye‑ri such as equipment staging, power/cable runs, unusual security, dewatering, evacuation patterns) have not been flagged in credible OSINT summaries. DPRK activity in 2025—IRBM with HGV, strategic/supersonic cruise missiles, Haeil‑2, and naval platform testing—suggests continued signaling below the nuclear threshold. Capability remains intact and leadership could choose to test, perhaps around a symbolic date (e.g., June 25) or in response to a crisis. External constraints are somewhat looser than in 2017 given closer DPRK–Russia ties and weaker UN enforcement, which nudges risk up from very low to low. Countervailing factors include likely Chinese disapproval, potential sanctions costs, and the regime’s demonstrated willingness to achieve signaling aims without detonating a device. The added detail from peers—recent 38 North imagery showing no specific prep and the historical seasonality—supports a low probability within the narrow window. Given this, I make a slight upward nudge from my prior to acknowledge non‑zero tail risk and the possibility of short‑notice testing, but the absence of last‑mile indicators and the short horizon keep me firmly low.\n",
