  "information": "By the end of 2024, Ukraine's total state debt had reached approximately 7 trillion UAH, equivalent to about 92% of the country's GDP. The state budget for 2024 operated with a significant deficit, and the Accounting Chamber of Ukraine reported a 29% increase in tax debt during that year. During March 2025, the Ukrainian hryvnia weakened from 41.1 to 41.4 UAH/USD. This 0.7% depreciation increased the UAH valuation of Ukraine's foreign-currency denominated debt by an estimated 9-11 billion UAH.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The data for March 2025 is expected to be released within a few weeks to a couple of months from today's date (2025-04-22).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Ukraine's government debt was approximately 7 trillion UAH at the end of 2024, nearly four times the threshold. The ongoing war and significant budget deficit mean debt is almost certain to have continued accumulating, keeping it far above 1.90 trillion UAH.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "For the outcome to be 'No,' Ukraine would have needed to experience an unprecedented and unannounced forgiveness of over 70% of its total government debt (more than 5 trillion UAH) in the first quarter of 2025. This, or a massive error in all prior debt reporting, is the only plausible path to a 'No' outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "This is the continuation of the current reality. Ukraine continues to finance its wartime budget deficit through international loans and domestic borrowing. The debt level, which was already ~7 trillion UAH, continues to grow in the first quarter of 2025, easily remaining above the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the overwhelming gap between Ukraine's known government debt and the question's threshold. The research indicates that Ukraine's debt reached approximately 7 trillion UAH by the end of 2024. The threshold for this question is 1.90 trillion UAH. This means that at the start of 2025, the debt was already 3.7 times higher than the level required for a 'Yes' resolution.\n\nThe fundamental drivers of debt accumulation have not changed. The country is engaged in a major war, which necessitates massive government spending and leads to significant budget deficits, as the report confirms for 2024. This spending is largely financed by borrowing from international partners. Furthermore, the report notes that the Ukrainian hryvnia depreciated in March 2025, which automatically increases the nominal UAH value of foreign-currency denominated debt. To fall below the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold, Ukraine's government would have had to shed over 5 trillion UAH in debt in just three months, a scenario that is contrary to all available economic and geopolitical evidence.\n\nMy forecast is not 100% only to account for the infinitesimally small probability of a major data reporting error by the source (Trading Economics) or a sudden, unannounced, and massive debt jubilee that is somehow accounted for in the March 2025 figures. It is not lower than 99% because the fiscal and military reality on the ground makes a 70%+ reduction in national debt in one quarter a virtual impossibility. I would only reduce my forecast if credible information emerged that a multi-trillion UAH debt forgiveness package was finalized and implemented before the end of March 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's government debt be at least 1.90 trillion UAH in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's government debt is greater than or equal to 1.90 billion UAH Thousand (in other words, 1.90 trillion Ukrainian hryvnia for the month of March 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/government-debt). Under 1.90 billion UAH Thousand resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBy the end of 2024, Ukraine's total state debt had reached approximately 7 trillion UAH, equivalent to about 92% of the country's GDP. The state budget for 2024 operated with a significant deficit, and the Accounting Chamber of Ukraine reported a 29% increase in tax debt during that year.

This 0.7% depreciation increased the UAH valuation of Ukraine's foreign-currency denominated debt by an estimated 9-11 billion UAH.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
