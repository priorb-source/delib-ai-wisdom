    "review": "Both forecasters provide well-reasoned analyses that align closely with my initial assessment. They raise several important points I should emphasize more: (1) Forecaster 3's observation that Trump might address the program using different terminology (e.g., 'visa lottery') rather than the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' is crucial given the specific resolution criteria - this adds another constraint beyond just taking action; (2) Both forecasters explicitly invoke the base rate/status quo principle more clearly than I did, which is methodologically sound; (3) The mention of procedural requirements (drafting, legal review, coordination) provides concrete reasons why rapid action is less likely. These are all valid considerations that somewhat strengthen the case for 'No'. However, I note that all three of us arrived at very similar forecasts (30-32%), suggesting broad agreement on the fundamental probability.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I remain confident in my general reasoning but should weight certain factors more heavily. The key considerations are: (1) Trump's historical opposition to the program creates real possibility for action; (2) However, 4 months have passed without action, suggesting this isn't a top priority; (3) The 6-week timeframe is sufficient for an executive action if prioritized, but tight given competing demands; (4) The resolution criteria requiring the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' adds an additional constraint - Trump might address the program but use different terminology; (5) Status quo bias strongly favors no action when nothing has happened yet. The forecasters' emphasis on terminology specificity and procedural time requirements are particularly persuasive. While Trump can act quickly on immigration when motivated, the combination of no current evidence of imminent action, specific wording requirements, and competing priorities suggests the probability should be in the lower 30s range. I'm adjusting slightly downward to acknowledge the consensus and the strong arguments about terminology constraints.",
