    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months and 5 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No successful coup occurs before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Political stability continues in both regions through June 2025. Any coup attempts that do occur either fail to gain control of government and military, or are successfully resisted by existing authorities. Countries with recent coup history remain under their current leadership without additional successful power seizures.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A military faction or elite group in an African country (most likely in the Sahel region such as Chad, Mali, Burkina Faso, or another West/Central African nation) successfully overthrows the sitting government and establishes control. Alternatively, a self-coup occurs where a leader in either region refuses to relinquish power through illegal means and successfully maintains control despite opposition.",
    "rationale": "With approximately 2 months remaining, I need to assess the likelihood of a successful coup in Africa or Latin America. Historical base rate analysis shows Africa experienced roughly 7 successful coups between 2020-2023 (approximately 1.75 per year), concentrated in the Sahel region. Latin America has had several failed attempts but no clearly successful coups in this period. For Africa, applying a base rate of 1.75 coups/year to a 2-month window suggests roughly 25% probability (2/12 * 1.75 ≈ 0.29 expected coups, giving about 25% chance of at least one). However, several factors temper this estimate: (1) We're already 4+ months into 2025 without a confirmed successful coup (Chad's January event is only a 'possible attempt'), suggesting either the base rate has decreased or we've been fortunate so far. (2) The short 2-month timeframe inherently limits opportunities. (3) Status quo bias suggests continuity is most likely. (4) The research assistant provided no additional information suggesting imminent instability. For Latin America, the probability is much lower (3-5%) given recent failed attempts but no successes. Combined, these yield approximately 25-28% overall. Why not higher (35-40%): The lack of confirmed successful coup in 2025 so far suggests conditions may be more stable than 2020-2023; only 2 months remain; status quo heavily favored. Why not lower (10-15%): Africa's clear coup pattern 2020-2023; several countries remain fragile; 2 months is sufficient time for political crisis; the base rate calculation supports ~25%. Updates would come from: news of political instability, military mobilizations, constitutional crises, or election disputes in vulnerable countries.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to [Powell & Thyne (2011, p. 252)](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf), a coup is \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\" In recent years, some of the coups in Africa have been:&#x20;\n\n* [Mali August 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Mali May 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Niger March 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Nigerien_coup_attempt) (attempt)\n* [Niger July 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nigerien_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Gabon August 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Gabonese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Chad January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%27Djamena_attack) (possible attempt)\n* [Burkina Faso January 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Burkina Faso September 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)&#x20;\n* [Guinea September 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n\nLatin America has had the following coup attempts in recent years:\n\n* [Peru self-coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Peruvian_self-coup_attempt), December 2022\n* [Brazil Congress attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack), January 2023\n* [Bolivia coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bolivian_coup_attempt), June 2024\n\nSee also: [VoA by the numbers Coups in Africa](https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is a successful coup d’état in any country on the African continent or Latin America before July 1, 2025, according to credible media reports. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nLatin America is defined as any country in North America or South America whose primary language is Spanish, Portuguese or French.\n\nA coup d’état (often shortened to \"coup\") is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) as an event in which a state's military or other components of its power structure overthrow the existing political authority.&#x20;\n\nA \"successful\" coup is defined as a coup in which the group or person attempting to seize power establishes control over both the government and military, and will be considered to have succeeded once any significant resistance to their authority has ceased.&#x20;\n\nA self-coup, [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup) as a political leader, having come to power through legal means, remaining in power through illegal means, will count. This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
