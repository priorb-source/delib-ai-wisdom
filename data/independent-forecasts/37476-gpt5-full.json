  "information": "GoPro's financial results for 2024 showed a full-year revenue of $801 million, a 20% decline year-over-year, with a net loss of $432 million, or $2.82 per share. As of December 31, 2024, the company held $283 million in cash reserves against $131 million in debt. The company's current ratio was reported at 0.5, and its market capitalization was approximately $90.68 million as of May 1, 2025, with a stock price of $0.58.\n\nFor its upcoming first quarter 2025 earnings report, scheduled for May 12, 2025, analysts expect GoPro to report a quarterly loss of approximately $0.13 per share on revenues of around $124.9 million, which would represent a year-over-year revenue decline of about 19.6%. The company itself has stated it expects unit sales and revenue in 2025 to be lower than in 2024, citing macroeconomic headwinds and competition. In response, the company has initiated plans to reduce operating expenses by nearly 30% during 2025.\n\nIn early 2025, GoPro announced it was named the official camera of the 2025 Freeride World Tour for the 12th consecutive year. The company also released a minor upgrade to its GoPro Max panoramic camera in February 2025. Reports in May 2025 also noted the release of a new GoPro Hero13 camera featuring an anamorphic lens. The company's most significant debt maturity is a convertible note due in November 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 53 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Q1 2025 results are weak but roughly in line with expectations; cash remains ample relative to near-term obligations; management executes on planned ~30% opex reductions; vendors and customers maintain terms; the company addresses Nasdaq bid-price pressure with a reverse split or compliance plan; no bankruptcy filing before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Q1 2025 reveals a sharp liquidity drop and/or a going-concern warning; suppliers tighten terms causing a cash squeeze; a debt holder accelerates or an attempted out-of-court exchange fails and the board opts for a prepackaged Chapter 11 to stabilize operations in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "Time horizon is short (~7 weeks). Bankruptcy filings within such a window typically follow acute triggers: imminent debt maturities, covenant breaches, legal judgments, or a sudden liquidity crisis.\n\nEvidence and current status:\n- 2024 results: revenue $801m (-20% y/y); net loss $432m. Cash $283m versus $131m debt as of 12/31/24; current ratio 0.5; stock price ~$0.58 (market cap ~$91m) as of 5/1/25. These indicate distress but also substantial cash relative to debt.\n- Near-term catalysts: Q1 2025 earnings on May 12 with consensus loss ~-$0.13 on ~$125m revenue (-~20% y/y). Company guides 2025 units and revenue below 2024, but plans ~30% opex cuts. Largest maturity is a convertible note due November 2025 (outside the resolution window).\n\nWeight on the status quo: With cash exceeding total debt and no immediate maturities or known maintenance covenants, the default path over the next few weeks is continued operations and cost-cutting, not a rushed Chapter 11. Companies in this position typically pursue expense reductions, capital raises, asset sales, or exchange offers before considering a filing, and usually time filings closer to a forcing event (e.g., a maturity) or when liquidity is down to weeks, not months. The November 2025 maturity is not a near-term forcing event, and reported year-end cash provides a runway that makes a filing before July 1 unlikely absent a sudden shock.\n\nWhy not higher: No imminent maturity; cash on hand is large relative to debt; bankruptcy usually follows either a covenant breach or an unmanageable liquidity cliff, neither of which is clearly present before July 1. The company is actively cutting opex, which should slow cash burn in 2025.\n\nWhy not lower: Multiple distress indicators persist—steep revenue declines, large losses, a very low market cap, and a weak current ratio. If Q1 reveals a significant cash drain, a going-concern warning, vendor tightening, or the hiring of restructuring advisors, the probability for a June filing would rise quickly. The market price signals elevated medium-term risk even if the near-term filing risk is modest.\n\nWhat would move me up: (a) Q1 2025 shows cash falling far faster than expected (e.g., cash < ~$200m), (b) explicit going-concern disclosure, (c) reports of advisors hired for restructuring, (d) supplier term tightening or shipment disruptions, (e) acceleration/default notices, or (f) failed exchange/financing efforts with guidance that an in-court process is likely.\n\nWhat would move me down: (a) Q1 in line or better with stable cash and liquidity, (b) concrete progress on expense cuts and gross margin stabilization, (c) credible financing/strategic alternatives, or (d) reaffirmed guidance without going-concern language.\n\nGiven the short window and current liquidity relative to obligations, the status quo outcome is No.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill GoPro file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and 2024 Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000150043525000003/gpro2024-12x31exh991xer.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nGoPro's financial results for 2024 showed a full-year revenue of $801 million, a 20% decline year-over-year, with a net loss of $432 million, or $2.82 per share.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
