    "review": "Both forecasters provide strong analyses that align closely with my initial reasoning. Forecaster 2 raises an important point I completely overlooked: the research assistant's report mentions minor injuries to Dvalishvili's finger and toe. While described as minor, with only 12 days until the fight, these injuries represent a real concern for both fight cancellation and potential performance impairment during grappling exchanges. Forecaster 3 also mentions information I missed - that O'Malley had hip surgery after their first fight and has been training with Israel Adesanya. This suggests O'Malley may be healthier and better prepared for the rematch than in their first encounter. Both forecasters use similar probability decomposition (fight happens × Dvalishvili wins), with Forecaster 2 at 58% and Forecaster 3 at 57%. Forecaster 3's breakdown is particularly helpful: ~80-85% fight happens, ~62-70% Dvalishvili wins if it happens. The convergence of all three forecasts in the 56-58% range is notable and suggests we're capturing the fundamental dynamics correctly. The key tension remains: Dvalishvili has a proven stylistic advantage and already won decisively, but O'Malley's striking threat, potential improvements post-surgery, and Dvalishvili's minor injuries all create meaningful uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast down slightly from 56% to 55%. The key factor driving this adjustment is the injury information I initially missed. Dvalishvili's finger and toe injuries, while minor, increase both the probability of fight cancellation and the risk of compromised performance in the grappling-heavy exchanges that define his advantage. Additionally, O'Malley's hip surgery and recovery may have improved his mobility and takedown defense - factors that could narrow the gap from their first fight. My probability breakdown: Fight happens as scheduled: ~83% (down from my initial 87% due to injury concerns). Dvalishvili wins if they fight: ~63% (consistent with my initial assessment, accounting for O'Malley's potential improvements balanced against Dvalishvili's proven dominance). Combined: 0.83 × 0.63 ≈ 0.52, but rounding up slightly to 55% to account for Dvalishvili's championship advantage and the recency of his decisive victory. This forecast remains in the cluster with the other forecasters (55-58%), reflecting our shared assessment that Dvalishvili is favored but faces meaningful risks from both fight cancellation and O'Malley's dangerous striking.",
