    "review": "All three forecasts converge remarkably on the 35-40% range, suggesting we've identified the key factors appropriately. Forecaster 2 and I reached nearly identical conclusions (40% vs 38%) through similar reasoning about El Niño transitions and the high bar set by May 2024. Forecaster 3 raises two particularly valuable points: (1) the 'status quo principle' - we should favor the existing record holding absent strong evidence otherwise, and (2) the specificity of the question requiring THE #1 spot, not just top-tier warmth. Additionally, there's a subtle but important observation: we're now past May 2025, and the research assistant provided no information suggesting exceptional warmth. If May 2025 had been dramatically warm, we might expect at least preliminary indications or media reports. The absence of such signals, while not definitive (NOAA's official rankings take time), constitutes weak negative evidence. All forecasters appropriately identified the El Niño-to-neutral/La Niña transition as a key headwind against breaking May 2024's likely record.",
    "rationale": "The clustering of all three forecasts in the 35-40% range increases my confidence that this is the appropriate probability range. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the status quo principle and the high bar for achieving specifically the #1 ranking is well-taken. The fact that we're now past May 2025 without any indication of exceptional warmth (no information from the research assistant, no obvious signals) provides weak but relevant negative evidence. While long-term warming trends favor higher temperatures, the combination of (a) ENSO transition away from El Niño, (b) the very high benchmark likely set by May 2024, (c) status quo considerations, and (d) absence of preliminary signals suggesting exceptional May 2025 warmth, argues for a probability modestly below my initial estimate. I'm adjusting slightly downward from 38% to 36%, aligning more closely with Forecaster 3's reasoning while remaining within the consensus range. This still acknowledges meaningful probability of a record given the underlying warming trend, but appropriately weights the various headwinds.",
