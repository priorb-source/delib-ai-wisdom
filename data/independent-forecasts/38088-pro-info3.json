  "information": "In late May 2025, several economic developments were reported. The US Consumer Confidence Index rebounded to a four-year high in May after falling to a five-year low the previous month, an improvement attributed to the temporary suspension of tariffs. US stock indexes, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, rose in anticipation of major tech earnings reports. The EU was given until July 9 to reach a trade deal with the US, a delay that experts considered a positive market signal. A prior 90-day delay in raising import tariffs led to a record $304 billion increase in the combined wealth of the world's richest people, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month, with the outcome determined on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked billionaire was from Italy.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The wealth of international billionaires, particularly in Europe, grows at a rate comparable to or greater than their US counterparts. A non-US billionaire, potentially the incumbent Italian, retains the 250th position as global markets react positively to delayed trade tariffs.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A strong rally in US stock markets, particularly in the tech sector, disproportionately increases the wealth of a US billionaire ranked slightly below 250. This surge allows them to surpass international peers and occupy the median position on July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the short time frame and conflicting economic signals. The primary factor supporting a 'No' outcome is the status quo; as of April 30, 2025, the 250th position was held by a non-US citizen. In forecasting, the status quo carries significant weight, especially over short horizons, as the world often changes slowly. However, the research provided indicates strong positive momentum for the US economy. The rebound in the US Consumer Confidence Index and the rise in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suggest that US-based billionaires, whose wealth is often heavily tied to these markets, are likely experiencing significant wealth appreciation. The delay in US-EU tariffs until July 9, which previously correlated with a massive wealth increase, is likely to buoy both US and European markets, but the specific mention of a US stock rally gives a slight edge to US billionaires. My forecast is not higher because the 250th spot is a knife-edge position. It could be retained by a non-US citizen due to positive European market performance or even minor currency fluctuations. The status quo is a powerful anchor. My forecast is not lower because the positive US economic indicators are strong and recent. A continued rally in US tech stocks could easily push a US national into the 250th spot. I would increase my probability for 'Yes' if there were reports of a major liquidity event (like an acquisition) for a US billionaire ranked in the 251-260 range. I would decrease it upon news of a significant US market downturn or a stronger-than-expected rally in European or Asian markets.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked name on the list was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025. It resolves as **No** if the 250th-ranked person is from any other country.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the \"median\" from the question's title is defined as the 250th ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, no matter how many are on the list.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn late May 2025, several economic developments were reported. The US Consumer Confidence Index rebounded to a four-year high in May after falling to a five-year low the previous month, an improvement attributed to the temporary suspension of tariffs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
