  "information": "The '50501' movement, a decentralized organization originating from a Reddit forum, planned nationwide protests on May 1, 2025, coinciding with International Workers' Day. The protests were organized to oppose the Trump administration's policies on immigration and labor. The movement's website listed over 1,000 events across all 50 states, with major demonstrations expected in Washington D.C., Chicago, Denver, Seattle, and Los Angeles. Organizations supporting the protests included the Political Revolution PAC and the Service Employees International Union. News reports following the event stated that over 1,100 protests took place under the '50501' banner across the U.S. and worldwide.\n\nOn April 5, 2025, demonstrations under the \"Hands Off!\" campaign occurred across all 50 U.S. states and in several international cities. A coalition of over 150 groups, including Indivisible and MoveOn, organized the events in response to administration policies such as federal layoffs, rising tariffs, and civil rights rollbacks. Participation estimates varied: one report cited over 1,400 events with nearly 600,000 attendees, while another stated over 600,000 people participated in more than 1,200 rallies. Solidarity protests were also held in cities like Berlin, London, and Paris.\n\nData from the Crowd Counting Consortium from early 2025 showed a notable trend in protest activity. The consortium recorded 2,085 protests nationwide in February 2025, more than double the 937 recorded in February 2017. However, the data also indicated that the average size of these events had decreased to an estimated 60-88 participants per protest. In separate protest movements, over 300 actions were reported on university campuses related to the conflict in Israel.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - The Global Protest Tracker has not yet reported any U.S. protests with 10,000+ participants meeting the criteria, despite recent major protest movements",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker either does not report the recent April and May protests, reports them with participant counts below 10,000 for individual events, or no additional large-scale protests occur and get reported before July 1, 2025. This could occur if the tracker uses conservative counting methodologies or if the protests were highly decentralized with no single event reaching the threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker reports at least one of the recent major protests (April 5 'Hands Off!' campaign or May 1 '50501' movement) with 10,000+ participants at a single location, likely in major cities like Washington D.C., New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago. Alternatively, new large-scale protests occur in the remaining two months and are reported above the threshold.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant reports two significant nationwide protest movements have already occurred: the April 5 'Hands Off!' campaign (600,000+ participants across 1,200-1,400 events) and the May 1 '50501' movement (1,100+ events). These are substantial mobilizations suggesting at least some individual city protests likely exceeded 10,000 participants, particularly in major metropolitan areas. However, several factors create uncertainty: (1) The Crowd Counting Consortium data shows protests are becoming more numerous but smaller, averaging only 60-88 participants per event in February 2025; (2) The question hasn't resolved despite these major events occurring, suggesting the Global Protest Tracker may not have reported them yet or reported them below the 10,000 threshold; (3) There's uncertainty about the tracker's methodology and reporting lag. The status quo favors 'No' since the question remains unresolved despite recent major mobilizations. However, with two months remaining and precedent of large-scale organizing, the probability of at least one qualifying report is moderate. My forecast is not higher because the average protest size data suggests decentralization, and not lower because the sheer scale of recent mobilizations (hundreds of thousands nationally) makes it likely at least some individual events exceeded 10,000. Key updates would come from: the tracker reporting recent events above threshold (increase probability significantly), confirmation that recent protests were all below 10,000 individually (decrease substantially), or new large mobilizations (increase moderately).",
