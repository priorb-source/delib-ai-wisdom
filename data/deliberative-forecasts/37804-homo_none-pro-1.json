    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental dynamics of this question: the extremely short timeline and the power of institutional inertia make the status quo ('Yes') the most likely outcome. Our forecasts are all clustered between 85% and 90%. The key contribution from my peers' analysis was the explicit identification of a specific, plausible mechanism for a 'No' outcome that I had not fully appreciated. Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 noted that the page could be pulled or the recommendation replaced with 'Under Review' text. This is a purely administrative action that bypasses the lengthy scientific review process, making it a much more feasible path to a 'No' resolution within the tight timeframe than a rushed, new scientific recommendation. This argument is convincing and highlights a key vulnerability in the status quo.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 90% was based on the near impossibility of a new scientific recommendation being formulated and published by July 1, 2025. While I accounted for 'political pressure', I had not fully weighed the specific scenario of an administrative intervention, such as taking the page down or amending it to say 'Under Review', which would resolve this question as 'No'. My peers' analyses rightly highlighted this as the most likely path to a 'No' outcome. This administrative action is far more plausible in a short period than completing a full scientific review. The political context hinted at in the prompt (an HHS review prompted by a prominent public health skeptic) makes such a move feel more possible than it would under normal circumstances. Acknowledging this plausible, low-friction pathway to a 'No' outcome convinces me to lower my confidence in 'Yes'. I am therefore updating my forecast downward from 90% to 85%, aligning with Forecaster 2.",
