  "information": "According to multiple polls from early 2025, Reform UK's support has grown significantly. A YouGov poll in early February showed Reform UK taking the lead over Labour for the first time, with 25% of the vote compared to Labour's 24% and the Conservatives' 21%. It found that one in four Conservative voters from the July 2024 election would now vote for Reform. Later polls from late April by sources like YouGov and More in Common showed Reform UK and Labour tied at 25%, or Reform slightly ahead at 26%. Polling expert Sir John Curtice noted the unprecedented unpopularity of both Labour (24% average rating) and the Conservatives (22%), with Reform narrowly ahead at 25%. A poll by Find Out Now in late January also placed Reform UK in the lead with 26% of the vote, ahead of the Conservatives at 23% and Labour at 22%. By contrast, the Politico poll-of-polls, the resolution source for the question, was reported in one analysis as showing Reform UK at 14.1%, significantly behind Labour (33.7%) and the Conservatives (23.7%).",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Politico’s UK poll-of-polls continues to show Labour (or possibly the Conservatives) ahead, with Reform rising but not taking a 4+ point lead; Reform may even briefly top the average but never by 4 points.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A string of May–June national polls shows Reform clearly ahead (e.g., Reform ~28–30, Labour ~22–24), likely driven by a major scandal or rapid voter realignment. The sustained sequence pushes Politico’s smoothed average to put Reform #1 with a margin of 4+ points for at least one update.",
    "rationale": "Status quo and momentum: Politico’s poll-of-polls is a smoothed average that moves gradually and requires multiple consistent polls to shift. As of late April, individual polls sometimes showed Reform tied or narrowly ahead of Labour (~25–26%), but not with a 4-point cushion. The research assistant also notes Politico’s average had recently shown Reform much lower than headline polls, reflecting smoothing and lag. That makes a rapid surge to a 4+ point lead in the Politico average within two months a high bar.\nBar required: The criterion is strict—Reform must be #1 and at least 4 points ahead in Politico’s average between May 1 and June 30. Given recent polls show a three-way cluster in the mid‑20s, a 4‑point average lead would require either Reform to climb several points while Labour and/or the Conservatives fall, or a sharp negative event for Labour that persists across many polls. Both are possible but not the base case.\nWhy not higher: Although some polls have Reform narrowly ahead, translation into a 4+ point lead in Politico’s average demands consistency across pollsters over weeks. Historically, UK national voting intention averages rarely flip by that margin so quickly for a third party.\nWhy not lower: The door is not closed. There are roughly two months left; if early May local-election dynamics, a major scandal, or Conservative disarray catalyze a bandwagon effect, multiple polls could put Reform clearly first, nudging Politico’s average into qualifying territory.\nWhat would move me up: Several consecutive reputable polls in early-to-mid May showing Reform 3–6 points ahead of Labour, plus Politico’s average narrowing to within ~1–2 points of #1. Clear evidence of a durable issue shock harming Labour would also raise odds. What would move me down: Reversion to Labour leads of 5+ points in most polls, or fragmentation with Reform slipping back to the low 20s, keeping Politico’s average well short of the threshold.\nSummary of RA info used: Individual polls in late Jan–Apr sometimes had Reform narrowly first (~25–26) with Labour ~24–25 and Conservatives ~21–23; Curtice noted unprecedented unpopularity of the two main parties. However, Politico’s poll-of-polls lagged far behind earlier, underscoring that the resolution source is slower-moving than headline polls. This underpins a low, but non-zero, probability.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
