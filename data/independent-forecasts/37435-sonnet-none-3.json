    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Chegg does not file for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Chegg continues operations despite financial challenges from AI disruption. The company maintains sufficient liquidity through cost-cutting measures, potential asset sales, emergency financing, or business model pivots to survive past July 1, 2025 without filing for bankruptcy protection.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Chegg's financial deterioration accelerates due to continued student migration to AI tools like ChatGPT. The company faces an immediate liquidity crisis, exhausts available credit facilities, fails to secure emergency financing, and files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before July 1, 2025 to restructure its operations and debt obligations.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires assessing the probability of a bankruptcy filing within an extremely short 57-day window. Several factors favor a low probability: First, the base rate of bankruptcy filings for publicly traded companies is quite low even among struggling firms. Second, even companies facing serious business model disruption typically have multiple options before bankruptcy (asset sales, emergency financing, operational restructuring, debt refinancing). Third, the bankruptcy filing process itself usually follows a longer deterioration pattern where companies exhaust alternatives over months or quarters. The WSJ article reference indicates Chegg has been significantly impacted by ChatGPT disrupting their homework help business model, which is concerning. However, without specific evidence of imminent crisis indicators - such as missed debt payments, going concern warnings from auditors, reported liquidity emergencies, or failed financing attempts - the probability remains low for such a near-term event. The research assistant provided no additional information suggesting immediate bankruptcy risk. My forecast is not higher because there's no specific evidence of an imminent filing within this tight timeframe. It's not lower (not near 1-2%) because the AI disruption mentioned is real and material, and without access to current financial statements, debt covenants, or cash position details, some meaningful uncertainty remains. To update higher, I would need: evidence of covenant violations, liquidity crisis announcements, failed financing, or going concern warnings. To update lower, I would need: evidence of stable cash reserves, successful cost restructuring, or secured financing facilities sufficient to last well past July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chegg file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWall Street Journal: [How ChatGPT Brought Down an Online Education Giant](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-chatgpt-brought-down-an-online-education-giant-200b4ff2)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Chegg, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
