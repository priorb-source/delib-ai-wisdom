    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully leans on the strong Thursday-in-mid-June pattern and Bloomberg’s listing, but I think 65% overweights third-party calendars and underweights process constraints. Without a DEF 14A this close, the prior for that exact date being correct should be below even odds. The Computershare June 2 contradiction further weakens confidence in any non-official listing. Forecaster 3’s framing is closer to mine: the lack of a proxy is the main drag, June 2 is implausible, and June 12 remains feasible but not confirmed. I think their 20–30% non-completion risk is a bit high (post-2024, GameStop will likely harden the setup), but it’s reasonable to keep some adjournment/technical risk in the teens. Overall, Forecaster 3’s reasoning nudges me slightly higher than my initial estimate; Forecaster 2’s feels too optimistic given the missing filing.",
    "rationale": "Key drivers remain: (1) No DEF 14A as of May 27 materially reduces the odds that June 12 is the official date; (2) June 12 fits the historical cadence (Thursday, mid-June) and multiple aggregators cite it; (3) Delaware law allows as few as 10 days’ notice, so June 12 is still feasible procedurally; (4) completion risk on the day is non-trivial given 2024’s crash and the strict resolution criterion, but likely lower than last year due to heightened preparedness. I decompose as: ~50% that June 12 is the scheduled date and ~80% that the meeting fully completes that day, yielding ~40% overall. I’m nudging up slightly from 38% to 40% after considering Forecaster 3’s argument that, given June 2 is effectively out, June 12 is the most plausible remaining early-June date, while still keeping the forecast below 50% due to the missing proxy. I would move to >90% on a DEF 14A or company press release confirming June 12; I’d drop to ~10% if we reach June 5 without a filing or if a filing sets a different date.",
