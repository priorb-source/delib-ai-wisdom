    "review": "My initial forecast of 75% was significantly misaligned with the other two forecasters (45% and 14%). After reviewing their analyses, I find the reasoning from Forecaster 3 particularly compelling and dispositive. My initial analysis was based on a general heuristic that a Prime Minister's resignation is a strong trigger for a snap election. However, I failed to consider critical, context-specific factors that the other forecasters highlighted.\n\nForecaster 2 correctly pointed out that appointing a new Prime Minister from the existing majority is a very strong and common alternative to calling an election, especially so soon after the December 2023 elections. This challenges my initial assumption that an election was the most likely outcome of the resignation.\n\nForecaster 3 introduced the most crucial argument, which I had completely overlooked: the practical timeline of Serbian elections. An announcement before July 1 would, by law and practice (45-60 days from announcement to election), schedule the election for late July or August. As Forecaster 3 notes, holding an election during the peak summer holiday season is politically suboptimal and generally avoided. This single point makes an announcement within our specific timeframe highly unlikely, even if a snap election is planned for later in the year (e.g., the autumn). A more probable timeline for an autumn election would involve an announcement *after* July 1, which would resolve this question as 'No'.\n\nThese arguments have convinced me that my initial forecast was fundamentally flawed by not accounting for these practical and political constraints. The path of least resistance and greatest political expediency for the ruling party is to appoint a new PM now and consider the timing for any potential election later, which pushes any announcement outside the resolution window.",
    "rationale": "I am making a substantial revision to my forecast, lowering it from 75% to 15%. This change is driven entirely by the arguments presented by the other forecasters, which exposed critical flaws in my initial reasoning. \n\nThe primary reason for this large update is the insight provided by Forecaster 3 regarding Serbian election timelines. An official announcement must precede the election by 45-60 days. Therefore, an announcement before July 1, 2025, would necessitate holding the election in August, a period of summer vacation that is highly impractical and politically unpopular for mobilizing voters. This makes it a very unattractive option for the ruling party.\n\nThe more logical course of action for President Vučić and the ruling SNS party, which holds a parliamentary majority, is to follow the path of least resistance: appoint a new Prime Minister from within their ranks to ensure government continuity. This avoids the cost and risk of an immediate election campaign and allows them to control the political timeline. If they do intend to hold a snap election, it is far more likely they would aim for the autumn, which would mean making the official announcement in July or August, after the resolution date for this question. \n\nMy new forecast of 15% reflects that the default path is now clearly 'No' (appointing a new PM and delaying any announcement). The remaining 15% chance accounts for low-probability scenarios, such as a sudden internal collapse of the ruling coalition or an unforeseen political crisis that forces an immediate and poorly-timed election announcement.",
