    "review": "Both forecasters raise critical points I underweighted. Forecaster 3's identification of Antoine Massey as a 'serial escapee' with THREE PRIOR ESCAPES is devastating new information that fundamentally changes the probability calculation. Someone with a proven track record of successfully evading recapture multiple times is qualitatively different from a typical escapee. This is not luck - it's demonstrated skill. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes the demanding 'all' criterion and notes that 70% were still at large after 3 days, which I didn't properly account for in my timeline analysis. Both forecasters appropriately highlight the selection effect: the remaining two have now survived 14 days of intensive manhunting, suggesting they are the most resourceful or best-positioned of the group. The status quo (2 at large after 2 weeks) is a stronger baseline than I appreciated. I was too optimistic in weighing the 80% recapture rate without considering that the final 20% may be disproportionately difficult. The inside job aspect also suggests these escapees may have had superior planning and resources from the start.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast downward significantly. The Massey serial escapee information is a game-changer - three prior successful escapes indicates proven evasion capabilities, not random luck. Combined with the demanding 'all' criterion, the 14-day survival period showing these are the hardest targets, and both facing extremely serious charges providing maximum motivation to stay free, the probability of 100% recapture within 32 days is lower than I initially assessed. However, I'm not going as low as 40% because: (1) The law enforcement response is genuinely massive and well-coordinated; (2) 32 days is still substantial time - more than double what it took to catch 80%; (3) The $100,000 combined reward and 700 tips show strong public engagement; (4) The systematic disruption of the support network (14 accomplices arrested) limits resources available to the fugitives. My updated forecast of 45% reflects that this is essentially a coin flip with slight edge to recapture based on resources and time, but heavily weighted down by Massey's history and the unforgiving 'all' criterion.",
