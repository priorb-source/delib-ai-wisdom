    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable additional evidence and reasoning. Forecaster 3's analysis is particularly compelling because it includes specific financial data I lacked: 'several hundred million dollars of net cash, positive free cash flow, and no large debt maturities before 2026.' This is crucial information that substantially reduces near-term bankruptcy risk. Companies with strong cash positions and no imminent debt maturities rarely file bankruptcy within 2 months absent a sudden shock. Forecaster 2's point about management's stated 2025 targets (30% EBITDA margin, >$100M FCF) also suggests they're not anticipating an immediate crisis. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize base rates - bankruptcy filings within such a short window are extremely rare without acute liquidity crises. Forecaster 3's distinction between longer-term distress signals (Altman Z-score) and near-term solvency (Piotroski F-score, cash position) is particularly insightful. The clustering of forecasts at 3-5% suggests we're all identifying similar dynamics: severe business distress but no immediate insolvency indicators.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I should update my forecast downward slightly. The key new information is Chegg's strong cash position (hundreds of millions in net cash) and absence of debt maturities until 2026. This substantially reduces the probability of bankruptcy in the 57-day window. My original forecast of 5% appropriately recognized the low base rate and lack of acute crisis indicators, but I didn't have the specific cash position data that makes near-term bankruptcy even less likely. However, I don't want to go as low as 3% because: (1) the business fundamentals are extremely poor (9 consecutive quarters of revenue decline, down 24% YoY), (2) the AI disruption is existential and accelerating, (3) unexpected shocks could occur (the Google lawsuit, sudden customer exodus, hidden liabilities), and (4) the stock trading at $0.51-$0.65 reflects market perception of severe distress. The probability should reflect that while bankruptcy in 57 days is very unlikely given the cash position, it's not impossible if a discrete adverse event triggers a rapid collapse in stakeholder confidence or reveals hidden problems. I'm updating to 4%, splitting the difference between my original 5% and Forecaster 3's well-justified 3%.",
