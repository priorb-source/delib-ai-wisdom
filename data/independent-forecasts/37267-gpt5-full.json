  "information": "Ethiopia's travel advisory from the US State Department is currently 'Level 3 – Reconsider Travel'. This was confirmed by multiple news reports from early May 2025 and a review on April 30, 2025, which did not place Ethiopia on the list of 21 countries with a 'Level 4' advisory. The State Department last downgraded Ethiopia from Level 4 to Level 3 in early 2023. While the nationwide advisory is Level 3, specific regions within Ethiopia, including Tigray and parts of Amhara, Oromia, Gambella, and Benishangul-Gumuz, carry a Level 4 warning due to localized conflicts.\n\nThe US State Department advisory system has four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). As of early May 2025, 21 countries were under a Level 4 advisory for reasons including terrorism, civil unrest, war, and health emergencies. Historically, out of the 25–35 countries typically at Level 3, only 2–4 are upgraded to Level 4 in a given year. Upgrades from Level 3 to Level 4 often follow clear catalysts such as coups, invasions, airport closures, hostage incidents involving foreigners, or the ordered departure of non-essential U.S. embassy staff.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, the U.S. announced sanctions related to renewed violence in the Tigray and Amhara regions. Ethiopia has neighboring countries, specifically Sudan and South Sudan, that are already under a Level 4 advisory. As of early May 2025, there have been no reports of a new nationwide offensive, a coup attempt, or a mass-casualty event involving foreigners since the sanctions were announced.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No – Ethiopia remains Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) with specific regions at Level 4.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Conflict and unrest remain geographically contained (Tigray, parts of Amhara, Oromia, Gambella, Benishangul-Gumuz). Addis Ababa and major transport corridors stay relatively stable; no ordered departure of U.S. embassy staff; no major attacks on foreigners or airport disruptions. The State Department maintains a nationwide Level 3 with regional Level 4 restrictions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp deterioration triggers a nationwide Level 4: e.g., significant escalation that disrupts Addis Ababa or major highways/air travel; a nationwide state of emergency; ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. embassy staff; mass-casualty/hostage incidents affecting foreigners; or airport closure/airspace risk that impedes consular assistance.",
    "rationale": "- Current state: As of early May 2025, Ethiopia is at Level 3 – Reconsider Travel; certain regions carry Level 4 due to localized conflict. It was downgraded from Level 4 in early 2023 and has remained Level 3 since. The U.S. announced sanctions on May 1, 2025 tied to renewed violence in Tigray and Amhara, but there have been no reports of a coup, nationwide offensive, airport closure, or mass-casualty event involving foreigners.\n- Base rates: Historically, of roughly 25–35 Level 3 countries, about 2–4 are upgraded to Level 4 in a year (~7–13% annual). Over a two‑month window, the base chance is roughly 1–2%. Ethiopia’s active regional conflicts and proximity to Level 4 neighbors (Sudan, South Sudan) arguably put it above that base rate, but a nationwide upgrade typically follows clear triggers (ordered departure, widespread urban unrest, foreigner-targeted attacks, major travel disruption).\n- Why not higher: Addis Ababa has been relatively stable; the embassy remains open without an ordered departure; there is no clear catalyst (coup, major terror wave, closure of Bole International Airport, communications blackout) that usually precedes a jump to Level 4. The State Department already mitigates risk through region-specific Level 4s, which lowers the need for a nationwide Level 4 absent broader deterioration.\n- Why not lower: Violence in Amhara/Tigray/Oromia is ongoing; fresh U.S. sanctions signal elevated concern; conditions can change quickly, and a single high‑impact incident (e.g., kidnapping/attack involving foreigners or major transport disruption) could prompt a swift upgrade.\n- What would move my forecast up: U.S. orders departure or restricts embassy operations; nationwide/statewide emergency with curfews and movement restrictions affecting Addis; significant clashes in or near the capital; major airport/airspace disruptions; credible, specific threats against foreigners; peer advisories (UK/Canada/EU) shift to broad “Do Not Travel/Avoid All Travel.”\n- What would move it down: Sustained de-escalation in Amhara/Tigray; signs of improved security on major routes; absence of high‑profile incidents; reassuring embassy/security communications.\nGiven the short time horizon and lack of triggering indicators today, I expect the status quo to hold, but I allow for tail risk from potential flare‑ups.",
