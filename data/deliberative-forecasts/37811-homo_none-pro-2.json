    "review": "All three forecasters are in strong agreement, with forecasts ranging from 95% to 97%. We all identify the same key factors: the very short timeframe to resolution, the strong status quo of the site being online, the primary risk being political, and the mitigating force of institutional inertia. Forecaster 3's analysis strongly reinforces my initial reasoning regarding the political costs of a takedown and the higher likelihood of modifying content rather than removing a site entirely. Forecaster 2 provided the most compelling new argument: that if removing Climate.gov were a high-priority action for a new administration, it likely would have happened in the first four months of the term (January-May 2025). The fact that the site is still online in late May significantly reduces the probability of a sudden, politically-motivated takedown in the subsequent 41 days.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast upwards. My initial reasoning holds, but Forecaster 2's point about the timing of political action is a crucial refinement. The 'danger zone' for a symbolic, 'Day One' style removal of the website has passed. Any such action now would likely be a lower-priority, more bureaucratic process. Given the extremely short timeframe of just 41 days until resolution, it is highly improbable that a new directive to remove the site would be conceived, approved, and fully executed. The forces of institutional inertia, as highlighted by myself and Forecaster 3, would almost certainly delay such an action beyond the July 1st deadline. Therefore, my initial 5% probability for the 'No' outcome now seems too high. I am adjusting my forecast to reflect the diminished immediate political risk, while still accounting for a small chance of a sudden directive or a major unexpected technical failure.",
