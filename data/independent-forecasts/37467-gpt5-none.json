    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 53 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beyond Meat continues operating through June, reports Q1 2025 results showing losses but sufficient liquidity runway, possibly trims costs further and/or taps a small ATM equity raise or vendor financing. No imminent debt maturity forces a filing, so they avoid Chapter 11 before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden liquidity crunch occurs (e.g., vendors tighten terms, a covenant/default event, or cash falls below a critical threshold). The board authorizes a Chapter 11 filing (likely in Delaware) to restructure leases/obligations prior to quarter-end, resulting in a petition before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: Only ~7 weeks remain. With such a short window, base rates for a sudden bankruptcy absent a known hard catalyst are modest, so the status quo (no filing) deserves extra weight.\n- Recent performance: The latest cited quarter (Q4 2024) shows an operating loss of ~$38M. Painful but not catastrophic on a quarterly basis, implying a cash-burn that many companies can sustain for multiple quarters if they still have a meaningful cash balance or access to modest financing.\n- Capital structure/maturities (general context): Beyond Meat’s primary long-dated convertible notes historically mature in 2027, so there is no obvious near-term maturity wall forcing a filing in the next 1–2 months. Absent a near-term maturity, filings typically stem from acute liquidity shortfalls or covenant/vendor issues.\n- Market/practical cues: Public companies with genuine near-term filing risk often show unmistakable precursors (retention of restructuring advisors, forbearance agreements, missed payments, or explicit minimum-liquidity warnings). Without such signals in hand, the two-month probability remains limited.\n- Offsetting risks: Ongoing losses, potential demand challenges, margin pressure, and constrained equity-raise capacity (given share price volatility) keep the tail risk alive. If Q1 2025 reveals materially worse cash levels, or if vendors tighten terms, the risk could rise quickly on a short fuse.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information available, so I rely on base rates, the most recent loss figure, and typical corporate distress dynamics.\nWhy not higher: No clear imminent maturity or widely reported acute distress signal; limited time window reduces odds.\nWhy not lower: Persistent losses, possible going-concern pressures, and the potential for vendor or covenant triggers that can force a rapid filing.\nWhat would raise my odds: Evidence of hiring restructuring advisors, disclosure of covenant breaches/forbearance, vendor tightening, a severe drop in cash/availability in the Q1 10-Q, or missed/extended payments.\nWhat would lower my odds: New financing or investment, successful capital raise, clear disclosure of ample liquidity runway beyond 12 months, or materially improved margins/cash burn in Q1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beyond Meat file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeyond Meat has had several years of losses and in the most recent quarter it [posted](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial) a loss from operations of almost $38 million.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Beyond Meat, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
