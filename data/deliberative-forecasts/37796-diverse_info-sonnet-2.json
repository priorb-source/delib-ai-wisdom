    "review": "Both forecasters raised critical information I had not considered. Forecaster 3's historical base rate is particularly significant: if 16 out of 17 plenaries since 2018 have resulted in grey list changes (94% base rate), with the sole exception being an October 2020 COVID-disrupted virtual meeting, this is much stronger evidence than I initially accounted for. Forecaster 2 provided valuable specific intelligence I lacked: Mozambique completed technical reforms and had a positive April 2025 on-site visit, making it a strong removal candidate for June. This adds a concrete near-term signal beyond the BVI addition case I identified. Nigeria's end-May timeline adds another potential removal candidate, though Forecaster 2 correctly notes the timing may be tight. The combination of an exceptionally high historical base rate (~94%) plus specific current signals for both removals (Mozambique) and additions (BVI) makes my original 75% forecast appear too conservative. I find Forecaster 3's emphasis on the systemic, dynamic nature of FATF monitoring compelling - the process is designed to continuously review and update the list. However, I'm slightly more cautious than their 95% because we're still a month away and procedural delays remain possible, even if unlikely.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the historical precedent is the most powerful evidence here. A 94% base rate across 17 recent plenaries, with the only exception being an extraordinary COVID-disrupted meeting, suggests the default expectation should be change rather than stasis. This shifts my prior substantially upward from 75%. Layering in the specific current signals reinforces this: Mozambique appears to be a strong removal candidate with an already-completed positive April on-site visit, and the BVI case I originally identified remains a compelling addition candidate with an expired remediation deadline and UK non-opposition. The FATF's institutional design favors continuous list updates - it would be anomalous for a June plenary to produce zero changes given both the historical pattern and the specific candidates in play. I'm updating to 90% rather than matching Forecaster 3's 95% because while the evidence is very strong, a month remains before the plenary and procedural or political factors could theoretically delay all decisions to October. However, such a scenario would be inconsistent with both recent history and current signals, making it relatively unlikely.",
