    "review": "The other two forecasters and I share the same fundamental reasoning: we anchor on the high base rate of corporate annual meetings occurring as scheduled, then adjust downwards due to the specific, tangible risk demonstrated by the 2024 GameStop meeting's server failure. We all agree that the company has powerful incentives (reputational and financial) to prevent a repeat incident. The primary point of divergence was the final probability. Both other forecasters independently arrived at 85%, whereas my initial forecast was 90%. This suggests I may have been underweighting the risk. They convincingly argued that the 'meme stock' nature of GameStop makes shareholder interest uniquely unpredictable and prone to surges that could overwhelm even upgraded systems. Their consensus provides a strong signal that a slightly more cautious forecast is warranted.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I am updating my forecast. While my core logic remains unchanged, their independent convergence on 85% has convinced me that my initial 90% was slightly too optimistic. I was perhaps overconfident in the company's ability to perfectly solve a technical problem driven by a highly unpredictable social phenomenon. The other forecasters correctly emphasized that the 2024 failure is a strong piece of evidence for just how badly demand can be underestimated. Furthermore, I am now giving more weight to the strict resolution criteria, where any postponement, even a brief one due to a minor technical glitch, would result in a 'No' resolution. This increases the number of potential failure paths. Acknowledging these points, a 15% chance of failure (an 85% probability of success) seems more appropriate than my initial 10% chance of failure. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast by 5 percentage points to align with the consensus.",
