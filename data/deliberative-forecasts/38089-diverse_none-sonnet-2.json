    "review": "Both forecasters provided critical information I lacked: the actual baseline data showing Erdoğan leads by approximately 11 percentage points. This fundamentally changes the analysis. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the large existing gap and short timeframe (33 days) is compelling - approval ratings rarely swing 11+ points in a month without major catalysts. Forecaster 3's more moderate position acknowledges this while recognizing that Turkey's economic pressures and normal polling variance create non-trivial probability of movement. Both correctly note that the 7-day trailing average smooths volatility, further reducing the chance of rapid swings. The key insight I missed was that this isn't a symmetric uncertainty problem - there's a substantial gap to overcome, not just volatility around parity. However, I find Forecaster 2's 15% slightly too pessimistic given Turkey's genuine economic fragility (inflation, fiscal pressures) and the fact that even modest movements by both leaders (Erdoğan down 5-6 points, Sánchez up 5-6 points) could close the gap.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating downward from 45% to 22%. My original forecast was far too high because I treated the lack of data as symmetrical uncertainty when the actual data shows a clear 11-point gap favoring Erdoğan. With only 33 days remaining and the smoothing effect of a 7-day average, the status quo strongly dominates. To resolve Yes, we'd need either: (1) a major Turkish crisis causing Erdoğan to drop 11+ points, (2) a Spanish breakthrough boosting Sánchez 11+ points, or (3) a combination of movements totaling 11+ points. While Turkey's economic situation (persistent inflation, ongoing adjustment) creates downside risk for Erdoğan, and normal month-to-month variance can be 3-5 points, closing an 11-point gap in one month remains unlikely. I'm settling at 22% rather than Forecaster 2's 15% because: Turkish economic pressures are real and ongoing, not hypothetical; normal variance plus these pressures could produce 5-6 point movements for each leader; and Morning Consult data does show meaningful month-to-month shifts. I'm below Forecaster 3's 23% because the 11-point gap is at the upper end of what seems plausible to overcome in this timeframe.",
