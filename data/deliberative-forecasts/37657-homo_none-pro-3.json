    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, have arrived at the same 1% probability based on a shared core rationale: the extremely short timeframe of about six weeks combined with the low base rate for a newly discovered animal virus to cause a detected human infection. The other analysts' reasoning is highly convincing and aligns with my own. Forecaster 2 helpfully articulated the specific, multi-step chain of events (spillover, infection, detection, reporting) that must occur for a 'Yes' resolution, reinforcing the improbability. Forecaster 3 introduced a crucial piece of information I had not explicitly considered: HKU5-CoV-2 is a merbecovirus, the same subgenus as MERS-CoV. This is the most significant new argument raised, as it provides a more concrete biological basis for a non-zero risk compared to a generic animal coronavirus.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 1%. The consensus is strong and the underlying reasoning is sound. The primary driver for this very low probability remains the extremely short time until the resolution date. The chain of events required for a 'Yes' outcome—a zoonotic spillover, subsequent human infection, clinical detection, virological confirmation, and official reporting by an organization like the WHO or CDC—is highly unlikely to complete in less than two months for a virus with no current signs of human transmission. The new information provided by Forecaster 3, that HKU5-CoV-2 is a merbecovirus related to MERS-CoV, is an important detail. It slightly increases the baseline concern for this virus over a randomly selected one and strengthens the justification for why the forecast should not be lower than 1%. However, this fact does not overcome the primary barrier of the timeline. Without any signals of unusual illness clusters or genetic evidence of human adaptation, this relationship to MERS-CoV is not sufficient to warrant an increase in the forecast. My initial 1% forecast was intended to capture the small, non-zero chance of such a surprise event, and this new information confirms that keeping the forecast at that level is appropriate.",
