  "information": "South Korea has been experiencing significant political instability. President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in December 2024, leading to his impeachment. The country's Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment on April 4, 2025. Following these events, a snap presidential election has been scheduled for June 3, 2025. Additionally, law enforcement authorities recently conducted a search of former President Yoon's residence as part of corruption allegations.\n\nSeveral large-scale protests have occurred in South Korea in the first half of 2025. On January 4, an estimated 35,000 people protested. On February 2, reports on participant numbers in an anti-Yoon protest ranged from 38,000 to 100,000. On February 15, a rally in Seoul demanding impeachment reportedly involved 300,000 people. On March 29, a protest demanding the president's resignation was estimated at 12,000 participants. On May 1, a Labor Day rally in Seoul organized by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) had over 8,000 participants, with police estimating attendance as high as 13,000.\n\nMultiple civic and political groups have been actively organizing demonstrations. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) and the Democratic Labor Union held rallies for Labor Day on May 1. The KCTU has also announced its intention to organize a general strike in July. Groups such as 'Free Korea' and 'Candlelight Action' have consistently held rallies and counter-rallies in response to political developments. Conservative groups have also planned a rally for May 18th in Gwangju.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, the current trend is one of frequent, large-scale protests in response to significant political instability, making another such event likely.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The June 3 snap presidential election proceeds smoothly with a clear and widely accepted winner, leading to a rapid de-escalation of political tensions. Protest fatigue sets in, and activist groups pivot from street demonstrations to other forms of political engagement, resulting in no protests of over 10,000 participants in May or June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A large-scale protest is organized in the lead-up to, or immediate aftermath of, the June 3 presidential election. The protest is fueled by political polarization, a contested election result, or dissatisfaction with the candidates, and is successfully mobilized by an established group like the KCTU or Candlelight Action, easily surpassing the 10,000 participant threshold.",
    "rationale": "My high probability forecast is based on the extremely high frequency of recent large-scale protests and the intensely volatile political climate. The research indicates at least five separate protests have surpassed the 10,000 participant threshold since January 2025, establishing a strong precedent. Key drivers of this unrest—the impeachment of the president, a pending snap election, and corruption investigations—remain unresolved and are likely to fuel further mobilization. The upcoming presidential election on June 3 is a particularly potent catalyst for protests, both from those opposing certain candidates and those who may dispute the result. Furthermore, well-established and capable organizations like the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) have a demonstrated track record of mobilizing large crowds and remain active. The probability is not higher because there is a small chance that the election produces a widely accepted result that successfully de-escalates tensions and channels public sentiment away from street protests. It is not lower because the sheer momentum and frequency of protests, combined with the major political flashpoint of the election, make the 'No' scenario unlikely. I would increase my forecast if a major new political scandal emerged or if groups explicitly called for mass protests around the election. I would decrease it if all major political blocs made a concerted and credible effort to calm tensions and discourage demonstrations.",
