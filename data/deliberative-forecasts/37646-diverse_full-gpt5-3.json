    "review": "Both analyses mirror my initial take: strong political/technical tailwinds versus historically longer operational timelines, with the latter likely dominating by July 1. They didn’t introduce new facts, but they sharpened the weighting on concrete frictions—payments, import/logistics, and security—and emphasized the 2.5‑month window as atypically short versus the 4–8 month African base rate. I agree Bangladesh is an outlier and shouldn’t be over-weighted. Their update triggers (ordering live, terminals in-country, announced launch date) are sensible indicators of imminent “Available” status. Overall, their reasoning is coherent and nudges me to lean more on the base rate absent fresh signals.",
    "rationale": "I’m trimming my probability modestly. Key positives remain: the license is granted; Musk and Somali officials have publicly signaled urgency; inter-satellite links obviate a local gateway; and there may be diplomatic tailwinds. However, as of mid-May the map hasn’t flipped, and historically Starlink toggles “Available” when ordering is functional, which likely requires at least minimal import pipeline and workable payments or a reseller arrangement—areas where Somalia faces atypical friction. The remaining ~6–7 weeks is shorter than the 4–8 month African norm, and there’s no visible evidence (ordering/live preorders, distributor announcements, or terminal shipments) pointing to an imminent switch. I still keep a material upside tail for a politically driven fast-track or a limited initial activation (e.g., Mogadishu) that satisfies the resolution, but the base case remains slanted toward No by the deadline. Triggers to move up: credible reports of ordering enabled for Somalia, a local distributor/ISP partnership announcement, terminals clearing customs, or Starlink updating the map shading. Triggers to move down: continued silence into mid-June or any indication of deferred timelines.",
