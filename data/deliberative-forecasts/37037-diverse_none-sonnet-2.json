    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a critical empirical claim that fundamentally challenges my initial analysis: they claim to have checked the actual HTS and found only '+ 25%' Section 232 tariffs on steel products (citing subheading 9903.80.01), NOT 50%. If true, this completely inverts the forecasting problem. I had assumed status quo meant 50% was already listed, but Forecaster 2 argues status quo is 25%, meaning Yes requires an INCREASE. Forecaster 3 seems to assume 50% is currently listed but provides no verification. Forecaster 2's specific citations and explanation of how the AP article may have misinterpreted the tariff structure (possibly doubling 25% base + 25% additional) are compelling. Their logic about the implausibility of increasing tariffs on a friendly AGOA nation in 5-6 weeks with no political motivation is sound. The question's specificity about exactly 50% and the note about suspension not affecting resolution now seem like potential red herrings rather than evidence of current status.",
    "rationale": "I am making a major downward revision based on Forecaster 2's empirical claim about the current HTS showing 25% not 50%. If their reading is correct, my entire forecast was based on a faulty premise. For Yes to occur would require: (1) The US government actively increasing tariffs on Lesotho from 25% to 50% in the next 5-6 weeks, (2) Despite no apparent political motivation, (3) Against a friendly nation that benefits from AGOA trade preferences, (4) When the AP article was highlighting the current situation as problematic, not calling for increases. This scenario is highly implausible. However, I'm not going as low as 1% because: (1) I cannot independently verify what the HTS currently shows, (2) There could be multiple tariff provisions I'm unaware of, (3) The question's specific framing suggests the asker may have knowledge I lack, (4) There's a small chance of bureaucratic error or unexpected policy action. My forecast drops from 75% to approximately 8%.",
