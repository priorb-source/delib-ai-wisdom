    "review": "All three forecasters independently arrived at 30% through remarkably similar reasoning, which provides some validation of this probability. The consensus identifies the same key factors: Osborn's explicit 'early summer' statement, his recent exploratory committee formation (only 3 weeks ago), his historical pattern (July 2023 announcement for 2024), and typical exploratory committee durations (3-6 months). Forecasters 2 and 3 raised an interesting point about definitional ambiguity of 'early summer' - meteorological summer starts June 1 while astronomical summer starts June 21. However, I find this argument weak. When someone says 'by early summer' they almost certainly mean June/July, not late May. May is spring by any reasonable definition. The phrase 'by early summer' most naturally means 'by the time we're in early summer' which would be June/early July, after the June 1 deadline. The convergence on 30% reflects appropriate uncertainty - the base rate evidence strongly suggests June/July, but 38 days provides meaningful time for acceleration due to political pressures or strategic considerations. No forecaster presented arguments that fundamentally challenge the core logic or suggest a different probability is more appropriate.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I maintain confidence in the 30% probability. The evidence hierarchy is clear: (1) Strongest evidence for No: Osborn's explicit 'decide by early summer' statement, which naturally refers to June/July, not late May; (2) Supporting evidence for No: his exploratory committee formed only 3 weeks ago, his 2024 announcement came in July (16 months before election), and typical exploratory periods last 3-6 months; (3) Evidence for possible Yes: 38 days is meaningful time, some 2026 candidates announced in April, Trump's endorsement could create pressure, and there's theoretical definitional ambiguity about 'early summer.' The convergence of three independent forecasters at 30% through similar reasoning strengthens my confidence this probability appropriately weighs the strong base rate evidence (70% for No) against genuine uncertainty from the time remaining and potential for acceleration (30% for Yes). I would only update if new information emerged about Osborn's actual timeline plans or campaign preparation activities.",
