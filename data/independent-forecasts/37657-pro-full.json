  "information": "A novel bat coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, has been identified and is part of the Merbecovirus family, which includes the MERS virus. Research published in the journal 'Cell' confirms that the virus can bind to human ACE2 receptors and infect human airway and organoid cultures in laboratory settings. However, studies also indicate that its cell-entry efficiency is significantly lower than that of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAs of May 16, 2025, no human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 have been reported by any major global health organizations, including the WHO, US CDC, ProMED, or GISAID. Post-COVID surveillance systems are in place in several countries, including China, Korea, and the U.S., which involve routine metagenomic sequencing of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases. To date, these surveillance efforts have not detected any signals of HKU5-CoV-2 in human populations.\n\nHistorically, of the approximately 50 novel bat coronaviruses described in scientific literature since 2000, only SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have produced confirmed human cases within a year of their first description. The rate of publicly reported accidental laboratory infections for such viruses is also low, estimated at approximately one per decade worldwide.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (45 days until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, May 16, 2025, there are no reported human cases of HKU5-CoV-2.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without any human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 being confirmed and reported by a major global health organization. The virus's relatively low cell-entry efficiency prevents a successful zoonotic spillover, and it remains confined to its animal reservoir.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A confirmed human case is detected and reported by an organization like the WHO or CDC. This most likely occurs either through a rare zoonotic spillover event involving an individual with high exposure to the bat reservoir (e.g., a researcher, farmer, or caver) or a contained laboratory accident.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily favors the status quo, which is no reported human cases. The primary reasons for this high confidence in a 'No' outcome are the very short time remaining until the deadline (about 1.5 months) and the low base rate for such events. Historically, zoonotic spillovers of novel coronaviruses that lead to confirmed human cases are rare; of approximately 50 novel bat coronaviruses described since 2000, only two have done so within a year of discovery. The evidence provided on HKU5-CoV-2 indicates that while it can infect human cells in a lab setting, its cell-entry efficiency is significantly lower than that of SARS-CoV-2, reducing the probability of a successful spillover event. While post-COVID surveillance is enhanced, which increases the chance of detection, these systems have so far found no trace of the virus in humans. For the question to resolve 'Yes', a chain of low-probability events—spillover, infection, symptomatic presentation, sample collection, sequencing, and official reporting—must all occur within the next 45 days. Why the forecast is not lower (i.e., not <1%): The virus has demonstrated the biological capability to infect human cells, making a spillover or lab accident technically possible, even if unlikely. A forecast of 2% acknowledges this tail risk. Why the forecast is not higher (i.e., not >5%): A higher probability would be inconsistent with the virus's known lower infectivity compared to pandemic-causing strains and the extremely short time frame for a rare event to occur and be reported. I would increase my forecast if there were reports of an undiagnosed respiratory illness cluster in a relevant region of China or a reported biosafety incident at a lab studying the virus.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
