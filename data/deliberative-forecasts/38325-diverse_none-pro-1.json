    "review": "The other two forecasters presented a compelling and unified argument that I had not sufficiently weighted in my initial analysis. Their core point, that revisions which flip the sign of GDP growth from negative to positive are historically uncommon, is a crucial piece of evidence I overlooked. I had focused too narrowly on the average *magnitude* of revisions, assuming a symmetric probability of moving up or down. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the 'status quo' and the 'burden of proof' for predicting a change in sign is a sound forecasting principle. Forecaster 3 added valuable nuance by analyzing the potential drivers of revision based on the report's composition (weak inventories/trade vs. strong domestic demand), which provided a concrete scenario for an upward revision. Their consensus at 30% signals that my initial 55% was a significant overestimate of the likelihood of a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast significantly from 55% to 35%. The primary reason for this large revision is the compelling argument from both other forecasters regarding the historical infrequency of sign-flipping GDP revisions. My initial analysis was flawed by treating a required 0.4 percentage point upward revision as a generic event, without considering the special case of it crossing the zero bound from below. The initial estimate of -0.3%, while close to zero, serves as a strong anchor, and the base case should be that the final number confirms the initial sign. However, I am not lowering my forecast to 30% to match the others. I place slightly more weight on the compositional argument raised by Forecaster 3. The fact that the weakness was reportedly concentrated in volatile components like inventories and net exports, while domestic final sales were firmer, presents a plausible and specific mechanism for a future upward revision as more complete data becomes available. This specific upside risk leads me to believe the probability is slightly higher than the 30% estimated by my colleagues, who seemed to weight the general historical pattern more heavily.",
