  "information": "Specific industries and markets have shown negative reactions to the economic climate. Moody's Ratings downgraded the retail industry's outlook to 'negative' due to 'bleak' prospects amid the ongoing trade war, predicting that tariffs will harm profitability and raise consumer prices. In response to tariffs, Volkswagen has implemented an 'import surcharge', and companies like Temu, Shein, and Hermès announced price increases. The financial markets have also been volatile, with the S&P 500 Index falling significantly after the tariff announcement. Separately, the U.S. beef industry has expressed concern that poor consumer sentiment could negatively impact demand.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2–3 weeks until the preliminary May 2025 release (typically around Friday, May 10, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (May 2025 Index of Consumer Sentiment ≤ 50.8).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariff headlines and price hikes keep inflation expectations elevated; gas prices drift higher into driving season; equities stay volatile or slide; news flow remains downbeat, reinforcing April’s plunge and keeping May at or below 50.8.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Markets stabilize or rebound, gas prices flatten or fall, and incoming inflation/labor data come in benign; consumers adjust to tariff news without further negative surprises, allowing a modest mean-reversion bounce above 50.8.",
    "rationale": "April’s preliminary reading of 50.8 is extremely low (second-lowest on record), which normally creates some scope for mean reversion the following month. Historically, the Michigan index often moves month-to-month and can bounce after sharp declines. That supports some chance of a May uptick above the low bar of 50.8. Offsetting that, current news flow is net negative: your assistant cites tariff escalations, announced price increases (e.g., Volkswagen surcharge; Temu/Shein/Hermès), Moody’s downgrading retail outlook to negative, and a notable equity selloff after tariff announcements. Such developments can depress consumer expectations and inflation sentiment, two key components of the index, especially into early May. Seasonally, gasoline prices often firm into late spring, another headwind. Balancing these, I put extra weight on the status quo (continued negative environment) and the fact that sentiment typically changes slowly absent a clear positive catalyst. That keeps me slightly below 50%. I’m not lower because: (1) the index is already near a historical floor, limiting downside; (2) mean reversion after outsized drops is common; (3) even a small uptick would clear the 50.8 threshold. I’m not higher because: (1) headline risks around tariffs and prices are fresh and salient; (2) equity volatility and cost-of-living concerns can linger in survey responses; (3) rising fuel prices would pressure inflation expectations. What would move me up: a clear market rebound, a downside surprise in late-April CPI/PCE or gasoline price declines, or indications that tariff impacts are being delayed/diluted. What would move me down: renewed market selloffs, further tariff escalations or broad price-hike headlines, or rising gas prices pushing up inflation expectations in early May survey waves.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSpecific industries and markets have shown negative reactions to the economic climate.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
