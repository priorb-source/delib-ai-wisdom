    "review": "The other forecasters raised critical issues I initially underweighted. Most importantly, both emphasized that the election is 5-6 months away, not a historical analysis - I was too anchored on past results (32-10 split). Forecaster 2's polling data is crucial: current vote shares show Bloc at 23-27% vs Conservatives at 23%, essentially a statistical tie, with the Bloc already devastated by the Liberal surge from 37% to mid-20s. This represents a massive ongoing shift I didn't fully account for. However, Forecaster 3's seat projection data (19-25 Bloc vs 10-12 Conservative) provides important nuance - even with similar vote shares, the Bloc maintains roughly 2:1 seat advantage due to vote efficiency and Conservative geographic concentration in Quebec City/south shore. Forecaster 2's 68% seems too pessimistic given this seat conversion advantage. The Conservative organizational problems mentioned in the background articles remain relevant. While the situation is more volatile than I initially assessed, the structural factors still favor Bloc winning more seats even if their dominance is reduced.",
    "rationale": "I'm revising downward but not as low as Forecaster 2. My initial 82% was anchored too heavily on historical patterns without properly weighing current polling dynamics and the 5-6 month uncertainty window. The key insight from deliberation is that vote share parity (23-25% each) doesn't translate to seat parity - Forecaster 3's projection of 19-25 Bloc vs 10-12 Conservative seats reflects meaningful vote efficiency advantages. For Conservatives to win MORE seats than Bloc, they'd need to overcome both a current ~10-seat deficit AND expand beyond their geographically limited base, which is structurally difficult in Quebec. The Liberal surge primarily hurts Bloc, not helps Conservatives. However, the volatility is real and 6 months allows meaningful shifts. Balancing the current seat advantage against polling closeness and volatility, I'm settling between Forecaster 3's 78% and Forecaster 2's 68%.",
