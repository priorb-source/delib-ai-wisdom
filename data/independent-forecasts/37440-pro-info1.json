  "information": "Several bills concerning voter citizenship verification were considered in Florida's legislature. HB 831 would require state-issued IDs to indicate non-citizen status. HB 1381 would require voters to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport or birth certificate, for new or updated registrations. SB 1330 would require first-time voters to present similar documentation. The 2025 regular legislative session concluded without enacting these bills. A comprehensive bill containing similar provisions, CS/HB 1381, was withdrawn from consideration on May 3, 2025. An extended legislative session, constitutionally required to pass the state budget, began on May 12, 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The extended legislative session, which is constitutionally mandated for passing the state budget, remains focused on fiscal matters. With the 2025 regular session having already concluded and key election bills having been withdrawn, there is no procedural vehicle or political momentum to reintroduce and pass such legislation before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Governor DeSantis, or the legislative leadership, calls a special session specifically focused on 'election integrity' or successfully adds the issue to the agenda of the extended budget session. Citing a desire to act before the next major election cycle, the Republican-controlled legislature fast-tracks a revised version of a previously considered bill, passing it and getting the governor's signature before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The primary basis for this forecast is the conclusion of Florida's 2025 regular legislative session without the enactment of the proposed legislation. The status quo is a powerful force, and the main window for passing new laws this year has closed. The fact that a comprehensive bill, CS/HB 1381, was withdrawn from consideration on May 3, 2025, is a strong indicator that the effort lacked sufficient support or was deprioritized, even within the Republican-controlled legislature. The current extended session is constitutionally focused on the state budget, making the introduction of non-germane, controversial policy difficult, though not impossible.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because the political will to enact such legislation clearly exists within the Florida GOP leadership and aligns with national party priorities. Governor Ron DeSantis has a history of using special sessions to advance his agenda, and he could easily call one before the deadline if he deems it a political necessity. The less-than-two-month timeframe is short but sufficient to pass a bill if the leadership is determined.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 15% due to the significant procedural hurdles. Calling a special session or expanding the scope of the budget session requires significant political capital and effort. Legislative inertia is strong; having failed to pass the bill during the regular session signals that its passage is not a foregone conclusion, and lawmakers may prefer to wait until the next regular session rather than engage in another contentious debate immediately.\n\nI would increase my forecast if the Governor or legislative leaders publicly announce an intention to hold a special session on this topic or add it to the current agenda. I would decrease my forecast if the extended session adjourns without the bill being considered, or if leadership explicitly states the issue will not be revisited until 2026.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral bills concerning voter citizenship verification were considered in Florida's legislature. HB 831 would require state-issued IDs to indicate non-citizen status. HB 1381 would require voters to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport or birth certificate, for new or updated registrations.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
