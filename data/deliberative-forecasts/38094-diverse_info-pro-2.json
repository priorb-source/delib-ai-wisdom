    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in broad agreement on the core factors: the status quo is a powerful force, the base rate for a senator ceasing to caucus is extremely low, and Senator Fetterman has explicitly stated he will not resign. Forecaster 2's most compelling point was the emphasis on the extremely short timeframe—just 33 days—which severely constrains the possibility of a complex political realignment. A caucus switch is not an impulsive decision and typically requires groundwork that we have not seen. Forecaster 3 provided useful, specific details about Fetterman's isolation and the active outreach from GOP senators, which reinforces the rationale for keeping the probability above near-zero, as it highlights a plausible mechanism for a 'Yes' outcome. However, I found Forecaster 2's argument regarding the timeline to be the most decisive factor in reconsidering my initial forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast down from 7% to 4%. The primary reason for this change is the deliberation, particularly Forecaster 2's powerful emphasis on the very short time remaining until the July 1, 2025 resolution date. A major political event like switching caucuses is a complex undertaking that is highly unlikely to materialize in just over a month without significant prior signaling, which is currently absent. My initial forecast, while accounting for the volatility surrounding the Senator, did not sufficiently weigh this temporal constraint. While Forecaster 3's points about GOP outreach and Fetterman's isolation are valid and prevent the probability from dropping to 1-2%, they do not overcome the immense institutional inertia and the practical difficulty of executing such a move in the given window. Fetterman's direct statement that he will not resign also heavily anchors the forecast toward 'No'. I am moving significantly closer to Forecaster 2's position, while my 4% forecast remains slightly higher to reflect the non-trivial tail risk of an unpredictable action from a uniquely unconventional politician, as detailed by Forecaster 3.",
