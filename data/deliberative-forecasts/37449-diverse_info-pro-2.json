    "review": "The other forecasters provided compelling arguments that have refined my thinking. Forecaster 2's emphasis on historical precedent (the US avoiding the term 'blockade' during the 1995-96 crisis) and the consistent use of calibrated, less-escalatory language ('coercive military activities') provides a strong anchor for the 'No' outcome. This highlights the very high rhetorical bar for the US government to use the specific term in the resolution criteria. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly persuasive in outlining a more plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome. The concept of a 'grey-zone blockade'—actions framed as a 'quarantine' or 'maritime inspection regime' that effectively seal a port—is a critical scenario I had not sufficiently weighed. Tying this risk specifically to the upcoming Taiwanese inauguration on May 20th provides a concrete potential trigger. The combination of these analyses suggests the key tension is between the high threshold for US rhetoric and a plausible Chinese action that could force the US to cross it.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 4% was primarily based on the extreme unlikelihood of a full, declared military blockade by China, given the catastrophic economic and military risks. The other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 3, convinced me that this view was too narrow. The introduction of a 'grey-zone blockade' scenario—such as a 'quarantine' or 'inspection' regime halting commercial traffic near a major port following the May 20th inauguration—presents a significantly more realistic, albeit still low-probability, path to a 'Yes' resolution. This type of action could be designed by Beijing to create ambiguity while still meeting the resolution criteria, potentially forcing the US to use the term 'blockade.' Consequently, I am doubling my forecast to account for this specific risk vector. I am updating my forecast from 4% to 8%. I remain below the other forecasters' 10-12% because I still place heavy weight on the arguments raised by Forecaster 2 regarding the strong historical precedent and the US's institutional reluctance to use a term with such significant legal and military implications. The economic self-harm to China from any action that genuinely halts commercial shipping remains a powerful deterrent.",
