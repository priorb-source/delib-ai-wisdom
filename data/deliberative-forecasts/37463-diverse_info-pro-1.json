    "review": "The deliberation highlighted a critical factual discrepancy in the baseline number of shares. I and Forecaster 3 operated on the assumption that the starting point was at or below 10 million shares, meaning a purchase was required for a 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 2 operated on the incorrect assumption that the starting point was ~10.7 million, making a 'Yes' outcome the default unless shares were sold. Verifying the public 13F filings confirms the holding has been exactly 10,000,000 shares for several quarters. This invalidates the core premise of Forecaster 2's 90% estimate. However, their arguments about Berkshire's macro strategy—being a net seller of equities for ten straight quarters and raising cash to record levels—are extremely compelling. When applied to the correct baseline, these arguments strongly support a 'No' outcome, as they create a high hurdle for any new equity purchases. Forecaster 3's reasoning, which also points to Berkshire's cash-building and conservative stance, aligns with this corrected view and reinforces my initial skepticism.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downwards. My initial forecast of 15% was based on the premise that the status quo was 10,000,000 shares, and that the low threshold for a 'Yes' (buying just a single share) made it a non-trivial possibility. The deliberation has reinforced this premise while adding a crucial piece of context I had underweighted: Berkshire's consistent, multi-quarter trend of being a net seller of equities to build a record cash position. This firm-wide capital allocation strategy provides a powerful headwind against making new purchases, especially in a non-core holding like Amazon. The fact that the position has been held at a round 10,000,000 shares for several consecutive quarters also suggests a deliberate decision to maintain its current size, making an active choice to add to it less likely. While a small purchase by one of the investment managers is still possible, it seems improbable given the broader strategic direction of the company. Therefore, I am decreasing my probability estimate from 15% to 8%, reflecting a higher conviction that Berkshire will either hold steady (resulting in a 'No') or potentially trim the position, in line with their recent behavior.",
