    "review": "The other forecasters raised valuable points that strengthen my analysis. Forecaster 2's historical precedent from the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis is particularly compelling - if the US didn't use 'blockade' terminology even during that major confrontation, this demonstrates strong rhetorical restraint. The April 2025 example where US officials used softer language like 'putting regional security at risk' despite explicit Chinese blockade simulations further confirms this pattern. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the two-step requirement (actual blockade PLUS public accusation) is crucial - even if tensions escalate, the US might avoid this specific term for diplomatic reasons. However, I note that Forecaster 2's own evidence about historical and recent US restraint actually argues for a LOWER probability than their 10% forecast. Forecaster 3's reasoning aligns closely with mine at 4%.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm maintaining my 4% forecast. The evidence presented reinforces rather than challenges my initial analysis. Key factors: (1) Historical precedent shows the US avoids 'blockade' terminology even during major crises - this is a legally significant term implying an act of war; (2) Recent April 2025 evidence demonstrates continued US rhetorical restraint despite provocative Chinese exercises; (3) The question requires both an actual blockade implementation AND a public US accusation - both are highly unlikely in 56 days; (4) No current intelligence suggests imminent blockade activity beyond routine exercises; (5) An actual blockade would represent an enormous escalation requiring deliberate high-level decisions in Beijing and visible military positioning. The 4% reflects appropriate tail risk for unexpected rapid escalation while heavily weighting the strong pattern of status quo persistence and US diplomatic caution on this specific terminology.",
