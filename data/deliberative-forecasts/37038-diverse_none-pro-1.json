    "review": "I found the other forecasters' analyses very helpful in sharpening my own. Forecaster 3's reasoning was particularly compelling, introducing a crucial point I hadn't fully weighed: the procedural and structural norms of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). The argument that revoking trade preferences typically reverts tariffs to existing statutory columns (like Column 1 rates), rather than creating a new, bespoke, and uniform rate like '17% for Israel,' is a powerful one. This adds a technical barrier on top of the already immense political barriers, making the specific outcome described in the question even less likely. Forecaster 2's analysis, conversely, seems to place excessive weight on a year-old article and general political speculation about potential tariff frameworks. A 25% probability strikes me as far too high given the complete lack of recent, specific evidence and the powerful inertia of the US-Israel Free Trade Agreement. Forecaster 3's analysis reinforces my initial assessment that the probability is very low.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 3%. My initial reasoning was based on the strong political and diplomatic inertia of the US-Israel Free Trade Agreement, the substantial political capital required to overturn it, and the extremely short timeframe of just over one month. The deliberation process, particularly the input from Forecaster 3, has strengthened my conviction in this low probability. Forecaster 3's key insight regarding the procedural implementation within the HTS is critical: creating a uniform 17% tariff for Israel would be a technically unusual action. The standard procedure would be to revoke preferential 'Free' status, causing tariffs to revert to the pre-existing and variable 'Column 1' rates for each product. This procedural hurdle makes the exact resolution criteria of a '+ 17%' listing less probable, even in a scenario where the political will to impose tariffs exists. I am not lowering my forecast further because 3% already represents a small tail risk for an unpredictable and unprecedented executive action, possibly as a 'listed but suspended' political signal, which would satisfy the resolution criteria. I am not increasing my forecast toward Forecaster 2's 25%, as that view is not supported by current evidence and discounts the significant political and procedural barriers to such a policy shift.",
