    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Erbil typically has mid-30s or higher direct destinations in summer schedules, and July is peak season.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security or regulatory disruptions (e.g., prolonged airport closure, regional escalation, Iraqi CAA restrictions, airline suspensions) reduce scheduled routes below 32 on July 1; or FlightsFrom removes seasonal/charter listings so the count dips at the check time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Summer 2025 schedules hold or expand: Gulf trunk routes (DXB, AUH, SHJ, DOH, KWI, BAH, MCT) continue; Turkey adds seasonal leisure (AYT, BJV/IZM) alongside IST/SAW; regional staples (AMM, BEY, CAI, Iranian cities) run; Europe sees seasonal diaspora flights (multiple German airports, possibly Scandinavia/Austria/Netherlands). Net result >31 destinations shown on FlightsFrom on July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates and seasonality: EBL is a regional hub with strong Gulf, Turkey, Levant, Iran, and European diaspora connectivity. Summer typically brings additional seasonal routes (Turkish resorts, extra European cities). The July 1 check aligns with peak schedule, making >31 a relatively modest threshold.\n- Evidence: The linked article frames Summer 2025 as a “promising season,” consistent with capacity additions rather than cuts. FlightsFrom counts individual airports (e.g., IST and SAW separately), which boosts totals.\n- Time horizon: Only ~5–6 weeks remain; most Summer 2025 schedules are loaded, reducing uncertainty from airline planning changes.\n- Why not higher: Residual risks include (1) security incidents that temporarily suspend the airport or specific corridors, (2) regulatory/bilateral frictions affecting Kurdistan-region international flights, (3) FlightsFrom’s listing behavior on the exact day (some seasonal/charter routes may not be displayed if not operating that week/day), and (4) macro-demand shocks leading to last-minute cancellations.\n- Why not lower: Even conservative counts across domestic Iraq, multiple Turkish airports, a broad Gulf set, AMM/BEY/CAI, several Iranian cities, and a handful of European destinations tend to reach the low 30s; summer usually pushes beyond that.\n- Updates that would move the forecast: Upward if confirmed current count is already >31 or if new seasonal routes to Turkey/Europe are announced and loaded into GDS; downward if there is a prolonged airport disruption, a regulatory clampdown on Kurdistan international flights, or multiple carriers pull summer service and FlightsFrom shows ≤31 in late June snapshots. The research assistant had no extra data; this forecast leans on historical patterns and seasonality, weighted toward status quo persistence.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 31 direct flight destinations from Erbil, Iraq on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nShafaq News: [Kurdistan Summer 2025: A Promising Season](https://shafaq.com/en/Kurdistan/Kurdistan-Summer-2025-A-Promising-Season)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 31 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Erbil (EBL)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/EBL) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
