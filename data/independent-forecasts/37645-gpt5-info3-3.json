  "information": "Following the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, a constitutional deadline was triggered, requiring the formation of a new government to avoid a mandatory snap election. According to multiple wire-service reports from March and April 2025, a new government successfully won a confidence vote in the Serbian parliament in mid-April. This event removed the automatic, constitutionally-mandated trigger for snap elections before the summer.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "46 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no announcement is made; the newly formed government continues without calling a snap election.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The government that won a confidence vote in mid-April 2025 remains stable, and the President does not dissolve the National Assembly or set an election date before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A political crisis or tactical calculation prompts the President to dissolve the Assembly and announce early parliamentary elections before July 1 (even if held later in 2025).",
    "rationale": "- What we know: Per the research assistant, the PM’s January resignation initially set a constitutional clock, but a new government won a confidence vote in mid-April 2025, removing the automatic trigger for snap elections. That substantially lowers near-term election risk.\n- Authority/announcement mechanics: In Serbia, the President dissolves the National Assembly and calls parliamentary elections by decree. The question resolves Yes if such a date is officially announced by the competent authority before July 1, regardless of when the election is held.\n- Status quo weight: Governments rarely call new elections just weeks after being formed or confirmed. With only ~1.5 months left in the window, inertia favors no announcement.\n- Reasons for a non-zero chance: Serbia’s leadership has previously used snap elections tactically, and politics can be volatile (e.g., protests, legitimacy debates, Kosovo-related tensions, coalition strains). A shock—major scandal, coalition fracture, significant unrest, or a strategic bid to reset legitimacy—could still prompt an early call.\n- Why not higher: The most straightforward pathway to snap elections—the constitutional deadline—has been neutralized by the April confidence vote. The governing bloc appears to have a working majority and recent momentum; calling elections immediately would be atypical and risky.\n- Why not lower: Serbia’s political system has a history of early elections, and leadership retains strong discretion to call them. External shocks or credible reports of coalition instability could quickly change incentives.\n- What would move the forecast up: Credible reporting of coalition rifts or defections; failure to pass key bills; large, sustained protests; explicit hints from President Vučić about ‘renewing legitimacy’; leaks about an impending dissolution decree.\n- What would move the forecast down: Clear public commitments from the President or key coalition figures against early elections in 2025; smooth legislative progress with no coalition tensions; absence of major protests or crises.\nGiven the recent successful government formation, the short remaining window, and the absence of a current trigger, a Yes outcome is possible but unlikely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Serbia announce a general election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Serbia could face snap elections as PM’s resignation confirmed](https://tvpworld.com/85681783/serbia-could-face-snap-elections-as-pms-resignation-confirmed-)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a general election will be held is officially announced by the government of Serbia or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, a constitutional deadline was triggered, requiring the formation of a new government to avoid a mandatory snap election. According to multiple wire-service reports from March and April 2025, a new government successfully won a confidence vote in the Serbian parliament in mid-April. This event removed the automatic, constitutionally-mandated trigger for snap elections before the summer.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
