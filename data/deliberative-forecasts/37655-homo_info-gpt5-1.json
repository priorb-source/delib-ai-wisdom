    "review": "- New/useful points raised:\n  - Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the authority requirement is important: only a Verkhovna Rada resolution (the body that sets the presidential election date) would satisfy the resolution criteria; statements from the President’s Office would not. That tightens the pathway to Yes.\n  - Forecaster 3’s timing point is also salient: if an October 26, 2025 date were chosen, the 90-day minimum notice means there is no procedural need to announce before July 1. That further depresses near-term odds.\n- Assessment of their forecasts:\n  - I find Forecaster 2’s reasoning sound and well-calibrated at the low end; it aligns with law, practice, and recent extensions under martial law.\n  - Forecaster 3’s 18% seems too high given: (a) fresh extension of martial law to August 6, (b) no deadline pressure before July 1, (c) the need for either early lifting or legal amendments plus a Rada resolution. The suggestion of a pre-announcement for signaling purposes runs into both legal and authority constraints and recent messaging from leadership.\n- Net: Their analyses reinforce a low probability; none present concrete new evidence of imminent legislative moves that would justify a material upward revision.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining: ~6 weeks. Status quo strongly favors No: martial law now extended to Aug 6, 2025; Ukraine has not scheduled national elections under martial law; leadership messaging remains that elections follow the end of wartime conditions. The binding authority for setting a presidential election date is the Verkhovna Rada; a qualifying announcement would need to be a Rada resolution naming a specific date (or a legally empowered act following a change in law). For a Yes outcome before July 1, Ukraine would need either (a) to lift or time-limit martial law soon and have the Rada set a date, or (b) to amend the legal framework to allow setting a date during martial law and then pass a resolution naming that date. There are no public signals of such moves, and there is no procedural need to act before July 1 even for an October election (90-day minimum notice points to late July). Given these constraints and the lack of a deadline forcing action, I keep a very low forecast. I would move up only on concrete signs: draft bills to amend wartime election restrictions, Rada leadership scheduling a vote to set a date, credible reports of an impending ceasefire or plan to lift martial law by a specific date. I would move down if authorities reiterate categorical opposition to any 2025 scheduling under current conditions or if the security situation worsens.\n\nNo change from my prior forecast: the added arguments (authority specificity and lack of a July 1 deadline) if anything reinforce a low probability.",
