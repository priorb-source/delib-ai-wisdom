    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable additional context. Forecaster 2 identifies a critical detail I missed: investigators found no indication the teen intended a crime, which severely undercuts any self-defense narrative and makes the optics even worse than I initially assessed. Forecaster 3 provides useful base rate data (40% baseline retention for recalls reaching ballot) and notes the recent success of recalls in small Colorado towns. However, I find Forecaster 2's reasoning more nuanced in acknowledging the genuine volatility of tiny electorates and the possibility that some voters may oppose recalls on principle or view them as premature before legal resolution. Forecaster 3's 20% forecast may underweight these structural uncertainties in a 400-voter electorate where a few dozen votes determine the outcome.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast downward from 30% to 25%. The key new information is that investigators found no indication the teen intended a crime - this is devastating to Metz's position as it eliminates the most plausible defense narrative. Combined with the base rate data showing 40% retention for recalls that reach ballot, and the fact that this recall involves an exceptionally serious violent allegation rather than policy disputes, the case for Metz's survival weakens considerably. However, I'm not going as low as 20% because the structural factors remain important: this is a mail ballot election in a 400-voter town where personal relationships matter, turnout patterns are unpredictable, and some voters may genuinely oppose recalls on principle or prefer to wait for legal proceedings. The convergence with Forecaster 2 at similar levels (32% vs my 30%) before this update suggests our reasoning is sound, but the investigator's finding warrants moving down somewhat while maintaining meaningful uncertainty given the small, volatile electorate.",
