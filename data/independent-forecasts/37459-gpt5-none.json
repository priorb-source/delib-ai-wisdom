    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 days (13F due by May 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire’s Q1 2025 13F shows no positions in Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla. This matches long-run behavior (Apple as the sole mega-cap tech core holding, with occasional Amazon) and a cautious stance on high-valuation AI leaders; any exploratory buys either didn’t occur, were sold before quarter-end, or are kept under confidential treatment and thus not reported.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Q1 2025 13F discloses a new stake in one of Alphabet/Meta/Microsoft/Nvidia/Tesla (most plausibly Alphabet, via a modest position initiated by Todd Combs or Ted Weschler), thereby revealing Berkshire holds shares of at least one of these names.",
    "rationale": "Timing: The 13F for period ending 2025-03-31 is due by May 15, 2025, so we learn the outcome within days.\n\nBase rates and status quo: Berkshire rarely adds new mega-cap tech positions; Apple is the exceptional, outsized bet. Amazon was a smaller, lieutenant-initiated stake. Recent behavior emphasizes conservatism and cash accumulation, suggesting limited equity buying overall. At the 2025 annual meeting, public messaging (historically) has been that opportunities are scarce and valuations rich, which reduces odds of initiating in AI-fueled names. The status quo outcome is therefore No.\n\nStock-by-stock considerations:\n- Microsoft: Buffett has long avoided it due to perceived conflict/optics given ties to Bill Gates; probability is very low.\n- Nvidia: Extremely high valuation and Berkshire’s prior quick exit from TSMC on risk concerns argue against it.\n- Tesla: Longstanding skepticism of auto makers and Tesla specifically makes this very unlikely.\n- Meta: Possible but less likely given rapid multiple expansion and Berkshire’s caution on high-flyers.\n- Alphabet: The most plausible among the five—durable cash flows, reasonable multiple relative to peers, and Buffett has previously praised it—yet still not the base case.\n\nOther mechanics: Even if Berkshire were accumulating, it sometimes requests confidential treatment to avoid signaling; the resolution requires the position to be reported in the Q1 2025 13F. If they sought confidentiality, that would resolve as No.\n\nResearch assistant info: None additional provided.\n\nWhy not higher: Lack of credible hints/leaks, Berkshire’s net-seller/cash-hoarding posture, valuation concerns, and historical reluctance to add new mega-cap tech beyond Apple keep the probability low.\n\nWhy not lower: Todd/Ted have latitude for smaller positions (e.g., their Amazon buy), Alphabet is a plausible candidate, and Berkshire has occasionally surprised with new names via 13F.\n\nWhat would move me up: Reliable reporting or Buffett/Todd/Ted commentary hinting at a new large-cap tech stake; indications that any prior confidential treatment pertained to one of these five; unusual pre-13F rumors from reputable financial media.\n\nWhat would move me down: Explicit confirmation from Berkshire that they hold none of these five; signals they were net sellers of tech in Q1; or evidence of a new confidentiality request likely covering a non-tech name (making a Magnificent 7 initiation less probable).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of any Magnificent 7 stock other than Amazon and Apple in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nInvestopedia: [Berkshire Hathaway Doesn't Hold Nvidia Stock—Will Warren Buffett Come to Regret it?](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffetts-secret-portfolio-dumping-shares-3-supercharged-artificial-intelligence-ai)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding shares of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
