    "review": "The other forecasters raise several critical points I underweighted or missed entirely. Most importantly, Forecaster 3's Easter timing argument is compelling and represents a major structural advantage for April 2025. Easter 2025 fell on April 20, meaning the entire Easter travel period occurred within April, while Easter 2024 on March 31 placed most Easter travel in late March 2024. This timing shift alone could add substantial passenger volume to April 2025. Forecaster 2's point about 7-10% airline capacity increases is also significant - airlines make these decisions based on actual forward bookings months in advance, indicating strong expected demand. The Q1 2025 growth data (3.6% YoY) provides stronger baseline evidence than I initially weighted. My original analysis overemphasized the power outage, which affected only 3 days with a 5.7% cancellation rate on one day - far too limited to overcome the Easter timing advantage, baseline growth trend, and increased capacity. I also gave too much weight to Trump tariff concerns without considering that US tourists represent a small fraction of Canary Islands visitors, which are predominantly European.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the Easter timing shift is likely the dominant factor in this question and vastly outweighs the power outage disruption. The combination of: (1) Easter timing strongly favoring April 2025, (2) consistent Q1 growth of 3.6% YoY, (3) airline capacity increases of 7-10% reflecting strong forward bookings, and (4) the limited scope of the power outage (only final 3 days of the month), makes a year-over-year decline highly unlikely. For April 2025 to fall below April 2024, the power outage and any other negative factors would need to overcome multiple structural advantages. The February 2025 data already showed 2.2% growth, and April has the added Easter benefit. While some uncertainty remains about full-month dynamics and potential unreported issues, the evidence strongly points toward continued growth. I'm revising my forecast significantly downward from 28% to better reflect these structural advantages.",
