  "information": "Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has stated that her government will permit a citizen-led referendum on independence in 2026 if a public petition gathers sufficient signatures. Smith has personally said she does not support separation but believes the decision should be made by Albertans. To facilitate this process, her government introduced Bill 54, which lowers the threshold for initiating a referendum from 20% to 10% of eligible voters (approximately 177,000 signatures) and extends the time for collection from 90 to 120 days. The government also formed a panel called 'Alberta Next' to explore the province's autonomy and future relationship with the federal government.\n\nThe process for triggering a referendum requires a successful citizen petition. The petition must gather at least 177,000 signatures, which then must be officially verified by Elections Alberta before the government can formally schedule a vote. As of early May 2025, a group named 'Project for Alberta Prosperity' announced its intention to organize a signature collection campaign. Its president claimed they had already exceeded the required signature threshold, while other unverified reports mentioned 80,000 signatures being collected in 36 hours. However, no petition had been formally submitted or certified by Elections Alberta.\n\nThe discussion around a potential referendum occurs amid heightened tensions between Alberta and the federal government over energy policies, the carbon tax, and fiscal distribution, particularly following the re-election of the federal Liberal party. The proposal has faced opposition from within Alberta. Leaders of the Sturgeon Lake and Mikisew Cree Nations have publicly opposed an independence referendum, stating their treaties were with the Crown, not the province. The official provincial opposition, the New Democratic Party of Alberta, has accused Premier Smith of promoting separatism.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months (resolution date is July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The administrative and political processes required to schedule a referendum will not be completed before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 'Project for Alberta Prosperity' either fails to gather the required signatures or submits them too late for verification. The verification process by Elections Alberta takes several weeks or months, extending beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline. Consequently, the provincial government does not receive a certified petition in time to officially schedule a referendum.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The pro-independence group has already collected a sufficient number of valid signatures and submits the petition immediately. Facing intense pressure from her party's base, Premier Smith directs Elections Alberta to expedite the verification process, which they complete in a few weeks. The government then promptly convenes and officially announces a date for a referendum before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The basis for my low forecast is the extremely compressed timeline. As of May 7, 2025, there are only 55 days until the July 1 deadline. For a 'Yes' outcome, several sequential steps must occur: 1) A petition with approximately 177,000 signatures must be formally submitted; 2) Elections Alberta must verify these signatures, a significant administrative task likely to take weeks, if not months; 3) The verified petition must be presented to the provincial cabinet; 4) The cabinet must decide to and officially announce a referendum date. The primary bottleneck is the signature verification process. There is no indication that this can or will be completed before the deadline. Furthermore, Premier Danielle Smith has publicly indicated a potential referendum would occur in 2026, suggesting there is no political will to rush the process. While the 'Project for Alberta Prosperity' claims to have exceeded the signature threshold, these claims are unverified and may be a political tactic. The status quo suggests that even if a petition is successful, the subsequent processes will extend well beyond the question's deadline. My forecast is not lower than 5% because the political environment is volatile, and a populist government could theoretically try to fast-track the process in response to unforeseen events or internal pressure. My forecast is not higher because the logistical and bureaucratic hurdles are substantial and favor a much slower timeline. I would increase my forecast if Elections Alberta officially confirmed receipt of the petition and announced an expedited verification timeline that concludes in early June. I would decrease it if no petition has been submitted by early June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith has stated that her government will permit a citizen-led referendum on independence in 2026 if a public petition gathers sufficient signatures.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
