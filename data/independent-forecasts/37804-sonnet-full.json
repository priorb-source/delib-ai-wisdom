  "information": "In April 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to instruct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending community water fluoridation. HHS confirmed it would convene the Community Preventive Services Task Force to study and issue a new recommendation. Concurrently, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reviewing 'new scientific information' on potential health risks of fluoride. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has begun the process of phasing out ingestible fluoride tablets and drops from the market.\n\nFlorida has become the second U.S. state, after Utah, to ban the addition of fluoride to public water supplies. Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law in May 2025 that prohibits additives not meeting a new definition of 'water quality additive,' effectively banning fluoride. The decision was supported by the state's surgeon general, who cited potential health risks. This legislative action reflects a broader debate, with some recent studies raising concerns about potential links between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopmental issues in children, while organizations like the American Dental Association continue to support water fluoridation as a key public health measure.\n\nThe U.S. Public Health Service and the CDC last changed the recommended fluoride level in 2015, when it was updated from a range of 0.7–1.2 mg/L to a single level of 0.7 mg/L. That revision process took four years, including public comment periods and interagency review. As of spring 2025, major professional organizations including the American Dental Association (ADA), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD) have reiterated their support for the current 0.7 mg/L recommendation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the CDC currently recommends 0.7 mg/L as the optimal fluoride level in community water supplies, which has been the recommendation since 2015",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "RFK Jr. and HHS rapidly pull the CDC recommendation page offline or expedite a formal recommendation change to a lower level (or no recommendation) through an unusually fast-tracked process, bypassing typical multi-year review procedures",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The normal bureaucratic processes prevail and the CDC recommendation page remains unchanged through July 1, 2025, as the Community Preventive Services Task Force review process that was just announced in April takes its expected multi-month or multi-year course",
    "rationale": "This question hinges on whether a major federal health recommendation can be changed in just 6 weeks. The key evidence supporting status quo: (1) Historical precedent - the last fluoride recommendation change in 2015 took 4 years, including scientific review, public comment, and interagency coordination. (2) The review process just started - HHS announced in April 2025 it will convene the Task Force, meaning they're at the beginning, not end, of the process. (3) Major professional organizations (ADA, AAP, ASTDD) support the current recommendation and will resist rapid changes. (4) Federal administrative procedures typically require public comment periods, scientific review, and multiple approval stages that cannot easily be compressed into weeks. Evidence against status quo: RFK Jr. has explicitly stated intent to end fluoridation recommendations, suggesting strong political will. The administration could theoretically pull the webpage offline as an interim measure (which counts as 'No'). State-level bans and FDA actions on fluoride products show policy momentum. However, even with political pressure, 6 weeks is extraordinarily fast for federal regulatory changes. The most realistic 'No' scenario would be pulling the webpage, but this would be unusual and procedurally questionable. The Task Force hasn't even been convened yet, making it virtually impossible to complete a full recommendation revision in this timeframe. Why not higher (>85%): There is clear executive intent to change this policy, and unprecedented rapid action is theoretically possible. Why not lower (<85%): The bureaucratic and procedural barriers to changing or removing federal health recommendations in 6 weeks are substantial, and historical precedent strongly favors slow institutional change.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn April 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
