    "review": "The analyses from the other two forecasters were highly convincing and displayed a strong consensus. We all arrived at the identical forecast of 25% by identifying the same central tension: the significant bureaucratic inertia of State Department advisories versus the credible, proximate security threats facing Tanzania. I found their framing particularly sharp and useful. Forecaster 2's point that existing risks are already 'priced into' the current Level 2 advisory, thus requiring a 'qualitative shift' for an upgrade, was an excellent articulation. Similarly, Forecaster 3's emphasis that a triggering event would likely need to alter the security assessment for the 'entire country' effectively underscores why the State Department might maintain its preference for targeted regional warnings. These arguments did not introduce new evidence but reinforced the strength of the case for the status quo holding over the short resolution period.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 25%. The deliberation process did not uncover new evidence but instead created a strong consensus around the key drivers of the forecast, reinforcing my confidence in my initial assessment. The shared reasoning confirms that the probability of a 'Yes' outcome hinges on a low-probability, high-impact event occurring within a very short timeframe. The other forecasters' arguments sharpened my view that the bar for a country-wide upgrade to Level 3 is high; it would likely require a significant event with national-level implications, such as an attack on a major tourist center, rather than a mere continuation of the existing, albeit serious, cross-border threats from Mozambique. Because the State Department already uses a targeted Level 3 warning for the Mtwara region, this approach is the most likely path for responding to localized escalations. Therefore, the 75% chance of 'No' appropriately reflects this high bar and the power of status quo bias over the next two months. The 25% chance of 'Yes' remains justified because the identified risks—particularly the active insurgency at the border—are real and volatile, and regional precedents show the State Department will act when its threshold is met.",
