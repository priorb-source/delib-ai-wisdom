    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days (from May 22, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - neither Donald Trump nor Elon Musk has tweeted the exact phrase 'diversity visa' as of today",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Musk continue their typical social media activity for the next 40 days, discussing various topics including general immigration policy, but never use the specific exact phrase 'diversity visa'. They might discuss related topics like immigration reform, visa programs, or border security using different terminology, but the precise two-word phrase doesn't appear in their tweets before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The diversity visa program becomes a topic of political debate or media attention in the next 40 days - perhaps through legislative action, a court ruling, or public controversy. Either Trump comments on it as part of his immigration policy positions, or Musk engages with content about it (given he follows accounts discussing this topic like @fentasyl). One or both use the exact phrase 'diversity visa' in their tweet, triggering the resolution criteria.",
    "rationale": "With only 40 days remaining, this is a relatively short forecast window. Both Trump and Musk are extremely prolific tweeters who frequently discuss policy topics, including immigration. However, several factors suggest a relatively low probability:\n\n1) **Specificity requirement**: The exact phrase 'diversity visa' must be used - not just related terms like 'visa lottery', 'immigration program', or general immigration discussion. This is a precise linguistic constraint.\n\n2) **Base rate considerations**: While both figures tweet often about immigration broadly, the diversity visa program is a fairly specific and niche aspect of immigration policy. It's not typically a primary talking point compared to border security, deportations, or H1-B visas.\n\n3) **Recent context**: The fact that Musk follows @fentasyl (who recently tweeted about diversity visas) provides weak positive evidence that the topic might surface in Musk's feed, but following someone doesn't guarantee engagement with all their topics.\n\n4) **Time frame**: 40 days provides a reasonable window for the topic to surface, but it's not guaranteed that this specific program becomes politically salient in this period.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: there's no immediate catalyst making diversity visas a hot-button issue right now, and the exact phrase requirement is restrictive. My forecast is not lower because: both individuals tweet prolifically about immigration, 40 days is sufficient time for the topic to arise, and there are over 1,000 tweets between them likely in this period. I would update higher if: diversity visa programs become subject to new legislation, court rulings, or media attention. I would update lower if: we get closer to July 1 without any political discussion of this specific program.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**. If not, it resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
