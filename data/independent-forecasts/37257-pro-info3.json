  "information": "Historical and legal precedents provide context for a potential referendum. Bosnia's Constitutional Court has ruled on multiple occasions that celebrating Republika Srpska Day on January 9 is unconstitutional. Despite this, RS held a parade for the banned holiday in January 2025. Analysis of other independence movements shows varying timelines: the process for Catalonia's 2017 referendum took approximately 7-8 months from legislative groundwork to the announcement, while Scotland's 2014 referendum process took about 2 years. In contrast, Crimea's 2014 referendum, under Russian influence, was organized in about two weeks. The political structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina is based on the 1995 Dayton Agreement, which divided the country into two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "approximately 2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The government of Republika Srpska will continue to use the threat of a referendum as a political tool without actually setting a date for one.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Milorad Dodik continues his secessionist rhetoric to rally his base and push back against the central government and international oversight. However, due to significant diplomatic pressure from the EU and US, including the threat of further sanctions, and a lack of explicit support from key allies like Serbia, he refrains from taking the concrete step of officially scheduling a vote. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major political crisis erupts, such as the High Representative imposing a law that severely curtails the autonomy of Republika Srpska or the state judiciary moving to arrest a high-level RS official. Feeling cornered and believing he has sufficient backing from Russia, Dodik makes a rapid, high-stakes decision to officially announce a referendum date to consolidate his power and force an international confrontation.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the long-standing pattern of behavior from the leadership of Republika Srpska (RS). For over a decade, Milorad Dodik has used the threat of an independence referendum as a primary tool for political leverage, but has consistently stopped short of initiating the process. This rhetoric serves to consolidate his domestic support, challenge the authority of the Bosnian state institutions, and extract concessions. This established status quo is the most likely trajectory to continue.\n\nThe structural factors weighing against announcing a referendum are immense. Such a move would trigger immediate and severe sanctions from the United States and the European Union, isolating RS politically and devastating its already fragile economy. Furthermore, crucial regional and international allies have not endorsed independence; Serbia is focused on its own EU accession path and would be placed in an untenable position, while Russia benefits more from a perpetually destabilized Bosnia than a new, isolated statelet it would have to support. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 10% because the political environment in Bosnia and Herzegovina is highly volatile. As the research notes, RS leadership has shown a willingness to defy the Constitutional Court, indicating a potential for further escalation. The example of Crimea's hastily organized referendum shows that if the political will exists, an announcement can be made very quickly, making the short timeframe a less significant barrier. An unforeseen crisis or a severe miscalculation by any party could precipitate such a decision.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 10% because calling a referendum would be a crossing of a major red line with predictable, severe negative consequences for RS. It is a high-risk gamble with little chance of a successful outcome (i.e., recognized independence) in the current geopolitical landscape. It remains far more valuable as a threat than as an action.\n\nI would increase my forecast if the High Representative imposes a highly contentious law (e.g., regarding state property), or if key allies like Russia or Serbia explicitly signal their support for a referendum. I would decrease my forecast if there were signs of de-escalation, such as successful dialogue between party leaders or a toning down of rhetoric from Dodik.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical and legal precedents provide context for a potential referendum.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
