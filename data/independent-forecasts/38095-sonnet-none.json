    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33 days. June 2025 begins in 3 days (June 1) and ends on June 30, 2025. The outcome will be known by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Trump grants 2 or fewer clemencies in June 2025. Mid-year months typically see fewer pardons/commutations compared to end-of-year or end-of-term periods, and presidential clemency tends to be episodic rather than steady.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump focuses on other priorities in June 2025, with no compelling clemency cases reaching his desk or decisions. He may be saving larger pardon announcements for July 4th or another symbolically significant date. He grants 0-2 clemencies during the month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump grants clemency to 3 or more individuals in June as part of ongoing clemency decisions. This could include a small batch of pardons for political allies, white-collar criminals, or criminal justice reform cases. Given the low threshold of just 3 individuals, even a modest clemency event would trigger a Yes resolution.",
    "rationale": "The threshold is notably low - just more than 2 individuals (meaning 3+). Trump granted approximately 237 pardons and commutations during his first term, averaging roughly 5 per month, though heavily concentrated in certain periods (especially his final weeks). The background article suggests Trump has been active with clemency in his second term, particularly for white-collar criminals. However, several factors create uncertainty: (1) June is a mid-year month without special significance for pardons; (2) clemency is often episodic, with clusters around holidays or political events; (3) we lack specific data on Trump's monthly clemency patterns in his second term. The status quo slightly favors No - most individual months historically see fewer than 3 pardons. However, the low bar and Trump's demonstrated willingness to use clemency powers provide significant probability for Yes. I would revise upward if reporting emerged about pending clemency cases or upcoming announcements. I would revise downward if Trump publicly indicated he's deferring clemency decisions or if June passes its first half with no grants.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump grant executive clemency to more than 2 individuals in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nGuardian: [Trump white-collar criminal pardons cost public $1bn, says ex-DoJ official](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/02/trump-pardons-cost-liz-oyer)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Donald J. Trump grants [executive clemency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_granted_executive_clemency_in_the_second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump) to greater than 2 individuals in June 2025.\n\nPartial pardons or clemencies count. They will only count if publicly disclosed. Wide-reaching blanket pardons or commutations also count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
