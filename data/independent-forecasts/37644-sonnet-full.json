  "information": "In March 2025, Anthropic raised approximately $3.5 billion in a funding round that valued the company at around $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion a year prior. Key investors in this and other recent rounds include Amazon (access to $8 billion), Google (over $3 billion invested), Lightspeed Venture Partners, Salesforce Ventures, and Fidelity Management & Research Co. Analysts have noted that the company's access to deep private funding from strategic partners lowers its immediate need for capital.\n\nAnthropic has recently launched its Claude 3.7 Sonnet model and is reportedly developing new features, including a two-way voice assistant and enhanced memory functions for its AI. The company announced a five-year, $100 million partnership with Databricks to develop corporate AI agents. Concurrently, Anthropic is expanding its operations into the Asia-Pacific region, with plans to establish an office in Korea.\n\nThe typical process for an initial public offering of this size involves preparatory steps that have not been publicly observed for Anthropic. There have been no reports or leaks to major financial news outlets like Reuters, the Wall Street Journal, or Bloomberg about the company hiring investment banks or filing a confidential S-1 form. Among U.S. venture-backed companies valued at over $10 billion (decacorns), the base rate for going public is approximately one to two companies per year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No IPO announcement. Anthropic continues as a private company with no public signals of IPO preparation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic continues operating as a well-funded private company, focusing on product development (Claude improvements, voice assistants), expanding partnerships (like the Databricks deal), and geographic expansion (Korea office). The company relies on its substantial private capital from Amazon, Google, and other strategic investors rather than pursuing public markets.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic files an SEC Form S-1 or makes an announcement on its website about planning an IPO before July 1, 2025. This would represent a rapid, unexpected strategic pivot given current circumstances and lack of preparatory signals.",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily weights the status quo. With only 46 days remaining, there are multiple factors strongly suggesting no IPO announcement: (1) Complete absence of preparatory signals - no reports of investment bank hiring, no confidential S-1 filings, no leaks to major financial outlets like Reuters, WSJ, or Bloomberg; (2) Recent substantial funding - Anthropic just raised $3.5B in March 2025 at a $61.5B valuation, providing ample runway and eliminating immediate capital needs; (3) Deep strategic partnerships with Amazon ($8B access) and Google ($3B+ invested) offer ongoing private capital; (4) Very low base rates - only 1-2 U.S. decacorns go public per year; (5) Company activities suggest operational focus on product development, partnerships, and expansion rather than IPO preparation; (6) Typical IPO processes require months of preparation that haven't been observed. The question only requires announcing PLANS for an IPO (not executing one), and uses two specific resolution criteria (S-1 filing or website announcement), which slightly increases the probability above near-zero. However, even a planning announcement would typically follow months of behind-the-scenes preparation that we haven't seen. I'm not going higher because there are simply no indicators of IPO momentum. I'm not going lower (closer to 1%) because surprise corporate announcements, while rare, do occasionally occur, and the criteria are relatively loose (just announcing plans). To update higher, I'd need to see: investment bank hiring reports, regulatory filing leaks, or executive statements about going public. To update lower: additional funding rounds, explicit commitments to remaining private, or more time passing without signals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn March 2025, Anthropic raised approximately $3.5 billion in a funding round that valued the company at around $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion a year prior.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
