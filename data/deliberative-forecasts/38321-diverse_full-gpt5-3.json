    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my reasoning: multiple on-record confirmations (White House + allies), strong policy incentives to attend, and minimal time remaining all point to Yes as the status quo. Forecaster 2’s 98% feels a bit high given persistent tail risks (health, crises, security, last-minute plan changes). Forecaster 3’s 87% seems a touch conservative given the strength and specificity of confirmations and the short time horizon. Neither introduced materially new evidence; the arguments about status quo momentum and locked-in logistics were already accounted for. Minor concern: some reporting details floating around (e.g., name misspellings, NATO SG ambiguity) suggest noise in secondary coverage, but they don’t undermine the core fact of official confirmation.",
    "rationale": "Key factors remain: (1) Public, on-record White House confirmation of attendance; (2) corroboration by allied leaders; (3) alignment with Trump’s agenda (burden sharing targets) increasing his incentive to show; (4) short lead time with international logistics typically finalized. Countervailing risks persist but are low base-rate: sudden health event, domestic or international crisis requiring him stateside, security concerns, or an idiosyncratic change of mind leading to delegating attendance. Given no new disconfirming signals and the strength of current commitments, I maintain a high but not near-certain probability. I would move higher with official release of a detailed schedule, visible pre-positioning for the trip, or departure. I would move lower on any credible reports of health issues, crisis-driven schedule changes, or if White House language softens from definitive to conditional.",
