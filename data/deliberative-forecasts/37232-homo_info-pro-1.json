    "review": "My initial forecast of 20% was fundamentally flawed. It was based entirely on the assumption that a predictable corporate event—the Q1 2025 earnings report—would necessitate a post on the company's News page. Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 presented a critical and convincing counter-argument I had missed: Virgin Galactic has a precedent of not posting financial results on this specific page, instead using Investor Relations channels. Forecaster 3's point that the Q4 2024 earnings in February did not generate a post is a powerful piece of recent evidence that invalidates my core premise. Their reasoning, combined with the context of the company's operational flight hiatus, is far more robust than my original analysis.",
    "rationale": "I am making a significant update to my forecast based on the deliberation. My previous reasoning, which relied on the Q1 earnings report as the primary driver for a 'No' outcome, has been proven incorrect by the other forecasters. They correctly pointed out that financial news is not typically posted on the main News page, a fact supported by the lack of a post for the Q4 2024 earnings earlier in the year. With this predictable catalyst removed, the analysis shifts to weigh the status quo much more heavily. The company is in a three-month communication silence, which is consistent with its broader operational hiatus as it develops its Delta-class fleet. This 'heads-down' period is the most likely state to continue through another month. I have therefore inverted my forecast, moving from a high probability of a post to a high probability of continued silence. The remaining 20% chance of a post (a 'No' outcome) accounts for other, less predictable events, such as an announcement about the final VSS Unity flight, a major partnership, or a significant technical milestone.",
