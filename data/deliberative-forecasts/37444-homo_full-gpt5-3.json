    "review": "Both forecasters’ reasoning is well-aligned with my prior view: short timeline, strong status quo bias for SDN listings, and current political signals running against relief. They add two useful angles: (1) OFAC can technically delist quickly if directed, so execution speed isn’t the main constraint; and (2) the 2021 Nord Stream 2 waiver episode shows policy toward NS2 can shift rapidly when politically expedient (though that was a waiver, not an SDN delisting). They also sharpen the idea that delisting could be a symbolic bargaining chip in a Ukraine deal. I find these points credible but still tail-risk given the lack of concrete indicators (no ceasefire framework, EU disinterest, cabinet opposition, and reports of tougher measures under consideration).",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is short (~8 weeks), and Nord Stream 2 AG is currently on the SDN list; absent a clear, imminent diplomatic package, inertia strongly favors no change. On-record denials by Sec. State Rubio, reported opposition from Interior Sec. Burgum, EU’s lack of appetite to revive NS2, and reporting that the White House is weighing harsher Russia energy measures (e.g., 500% tariffs) all point away from near-term delisting. Even if delisted, operational upside is minimal given pipeline damage and NS2 AG’s legal/financial constraints, reducing the incentive to spend political capital now. The main upside risk remains a sudden, transactional move tied to a Ukraine ceasefire in which NS2 AG delisting is used as a symbolic concession; OFAC could implement quickly if ordered. However, there are currently no strong public indicators of such a deal or coordinated US–EU shift. Considering peers’ points does not materially change my balance of probabilities. I keep my forecast at 9% to reflect a small but non-negligible tail for a negotiated delisting executed on short notice.",
