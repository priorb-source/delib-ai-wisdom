    "review": "Both forecasters largely match my read. They emphasize the procedural hurdle that policy is closed post-regular session absent a special session or expanded scope during the budget extension—an important constraint. They also highlight NVRA/preemption litigation risk (Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council; Kansas experience) as a plausible reason leadership let the bills die, even though legality doesn’t affect resolution. Forecaster 3 is a bit more optimistic (25%), leaning on Florida’s willingness to use special sessions for priority issues and the broad resolution bar (any expansion counts). I find their arguments sound, but they don’t add decisive new evidence that would materially shift my base case; the key uncertainty remains whether leadership will proactively call or broaden a session for this issue within ~8 weeks, and there are no signals of that yet.",
    "rationale": "Time is tight (~8 weeks) and the regular session ended without passage; key vehicles were withdrawn. The May budget extension is typically confined to appropriations, and slipping non-germane election policy into conforming bills would be unusual and politically costly absent clear leadership will. A separate special session is possible given GOP supermajorities and the Governor’s appetite for election-related legislation, and the bar for a Yes is low (any expansion, including narrower subsets like first-time registrants or ID notation). However, the fact that leadership let these provisions die in regular session, combined with foreseeable NVRA litigation and administrative pushback, suggests limited appetite to rush this before July 1. National GOP momentum increases plausibility but doesn’t overcome the procedural and timing constraints without explicit moves from Florida leadership. I’m watching for: (1) a special session call including election/citizenship verification; (2) leadership statements expanding the budget-extension scope to include election policy; (3) newly filed bills or strike-alls reviving HB 831/HB 1381/SB 1330 content; (4) committee notices. In the absence of such signals, my prior estimate stands.",
