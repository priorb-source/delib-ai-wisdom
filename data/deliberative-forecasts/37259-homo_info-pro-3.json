    "review": "I found the deliberation with my colleagues very useful. Forecaster 2's analysis strongly aligns with my own, and their specific mention of a multi-year commission for independence negotiations is a key piece of evidence that reinforces my initial a conclusion that the government is pursuing a long-term, deliberate strategy. This makes a sudden announcement in the next two months even less likely. Forecaster 3 introduces an interesting angle by emphasizing the 'unusually volatile' political environment due to foreign interest and the possibility of a catalyst event. While I agree that such catalysts are possible, I believe their 15% forecast significantly overstates the probability of such an event occurring *and* triggering a complete reversal of government policy within the extremely short remaining timeframe. Paradoxically, the poll data Forecaster 3 cites—that nearly half of independence supporters would reconsider if it meant economic decline—actually strengthens my conviction in the 'No' outcome, as it confirms the government's cautious, economy-first approach is aligned with the public's pragmatic concerns.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am maintaining my core reasoning but making a small adjustment to my forecast. My primary view remains that an announcement is highly improbable. The arguments for this are now even stronger: the current government won a recent election on a gradualist platform, the Greenlandic economy remains heavily dependent on Danish subsidies, and, as pointed out by Forecaster 2, a multi-year commission has been established, signaling a long-term, not short-term, horizon. These factors create powerful inertia against a referendum announcement in the next two months. However, Forecaster 3's argument about the potential for a political catalyst event in a volatile environment is a valid consideration, even if I disagree with their high probability. It forces me to more explicitly account for low-probability, high-impact 'black swan' events. For this reason, I am slightly increasing my forecast from 3% to 4%. This small increase reflects a marginal increase in my uncertainty due to external pressures, while still holding firm to the belief that the internal political and economic realities make an announcement before the deadline extremely unlikely.",
