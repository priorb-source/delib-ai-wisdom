    "review": "Both forecasters largely match my base-rate framing (separate headliners unless explicitly billed together). New/useful points they raised: (1) YC’s association with Altman could make Musk less willing to appear jointly on YC’s turf; (2) the possibility that even a brief group-on-stage photo/thank-you would satisfy the criterion; (3) a historical precedent of Altman interviewing Musk at a YC event in 2016. I find (1) directionally persuasive and underweighted in my prior; (2) modestly increases the tail for a surprise “Yes” but is operationally nontrivial given security/scheduling; (3) is weakly supportive given the relationship has since soured and competitive dynamics are sharper now. Overall, their reasoning is consistent and nudges me slightly down from my prior.",
    "rationale": "I’m updating modestly downward. The absence of any agenda tease ~20 days out and YC being Altman-aligned both lower odds of a joint segment being greenlit or accepted by Musk. The group-on-stage closure/photo scenario is a valid pathway to “Yes,” but relies on coordinated security and time windows for two very busy principals—plausible yet not the default. The conciliatory signals from Altman keep probability above a low base, and YC has strong incentive to create a marquee moment; however, Musk’s unpredictability and rivalry dynamics keep the modal outcome at separate appearances. Net effect: small downgrade from 27% to 23%. I would move up materially if YC publishes or credibly leaks a joint session or if either party publicly hints at sharing a stage; I would move down if the final agenda shows strictly solo segments, if either shifts to remote, or if fresh public friction emerges.",
