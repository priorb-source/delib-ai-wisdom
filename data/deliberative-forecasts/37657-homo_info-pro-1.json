    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling and well-structured arguments that reinforce a low-probability assessment. Forecaster 2's breakdown of the required 'detection cascade'—from spillover to symptoms, testing, sequencing, and official reporting—is a very useful framework. It highlights the multiple, independent steps that must all be completed successfully within the short 45-day window, strengthening the argument that a 'Yes' resolution is highly improbable. Forecaster 3 introduces the most impactful new piece of evidence: a quantitative base rate for zoonotic spillovers. The statistic that only two of approximately 50 novel bat coronaviruses discovered since 2000 led to confirmed human cases within a year provides a powerful anchor for the forecast. This evidence-based argument is highly convincing and suggests that my initial forecast may have been slightly too high.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 2% to 1%. The decision is driven primarily by the quantitative base rate provided by Forecaster 3. A historical rate of 2/50 spillovers within a year for newly discovered viruses, when adjusted for the extremely short ~1.5-month timeframe of this question, strongly suggests a probability closer to 1% than 2%. This data provides a more robust, quantitative anchor than my initial qualitative assessment. Furthermore, Forecaster 2's concept of the 'detection cascade' reinforces this downward adjustment by illustrating the sequential, low-probability hurdles that must be overcome for a case to be officially reported before the deadline. While my core reasoning remains unchanged—the biological pathway exists but is inefficient, and the timeline is very short—this new evidence allows for a more refined and better-justified probability estimate.",
