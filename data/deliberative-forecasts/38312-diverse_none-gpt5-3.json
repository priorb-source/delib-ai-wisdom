    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize host prerogative, the acute Canada–India rift, and late timing/logistical hurdles. New, useful angles they add: (1) domestic optics for Trudeau (inviting without visible progress on the Nijjar case) and for Modi (accepting could be framed as weakness), which further constrain both an invite and acceptance; (2) day-by-day decay as June advances; (3) the possibility of other G7 members lobbying Canada, which is the main path to a late reversal. I agree with their structure but find 20% high given the absence of credible leaks or a public signal this close to the summit and the salience of the bilateral dispute for the host.",
    "rationale": "My scenario tree remains: P(invite) × P(accept | invite) × P(Modi personally attends | accept). With strained Canada–India ties and other outreach invitees already named, I put P(invite) low. Even if invited, India likely accepts, but not guaranteed due to optics; and Modi personally attending is probable but not assured. Multiplying through yields a single-digit likelihood. The lack of any invite/leak by early June and the host’s domestic constraints dominate the base rate of India’s past G7 outreach attendance. I would move up sharply on credible reporting of an invitation or visible bilateral de-escalation; I would move down on a final guest list excluding India or continued silence as the summit nears.",
