    "review": "All three forecasts correctly identify the core tension between Zimbabwe's strong political motivation for international re-engagement and its severe economic and bureaucratic constraints. My initial forecast was positioned between the other two. Forecaster 2 made the most compelling new argument by highlighting the structure of the compensation deal: the recent $3.1 million payment represents the 1% cash portion due for the 'first batch' of 740 claims, with the other 99% to be settled via ten-year bonds. This is a crucial detail, as it provides a structural reason why another cash payment is not the logical next step; the government has, in a sense, fulfilled its immediate cash obligation for this group and can now proceed to the bond issuance phase. This makes a second cash disbursement before June 1 much less probable than I had initially thought. Forecaster 3's analysis rightly emphasized the government's demonstrated capacity to act decisively for political gain, pointing to the separate $20 million payment made in February 2025. This serves as a necessary check against excessive pessimism, confirming that the government can make payments when sufficiently motivated, but it doesn't override the specific structural argument from Forecaster 2 about the Global Compensation Deed's process.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am revising my forecast downward. My initial reasoning was a balance between political will and logistical friction. However, Forecaster 2's insight into the 1% cash / 99% bond structure for the first batch of claims significantly strengthens the case for 'No'. The April payment was not just an arbitrary tranche; it was a specific fulfillment of the cash component of the agreement for those 740 farmers. The logical next financial action for this group would be the issuance of bonds, not another cash payment. For a new cash payment to occur, the government would have to either (a) rapidly process and approve a second batch of claims, which is highly improbable given the short timeframe, or (b) make an ad-hoc, symbolic payment outside the established structure. While the political drivers mentioned by Forecaster 3 are real, the procedural logic now points strongly toward a pause in cash disbursements. The remaining $6.9 million in the 2025 budget is not a guarantee of imminent spending, especially when the agreed-upon process doesn't call for it. Consequently, I am lowering my probability from 35% to 25%, reflecting the greatly reduced likelihood that another cash payment will be procedurally triggered before the June 1 deadline.",
