  "information": "In late April 2025, during a series of town hall meetings, Beto O'Rourke stated that he would consider running for the U.S. Senate if it aligns with the desires of Texas voters. Quoted in multiple outlets such as Fox News, The Hill, and Yahoo, he said, 'If it comes to pass that this is what the people of Texas want, that it's the highest and best use of what I can give to you, then yes, I will.' As of late May 2025, O'Rourke had not filed any formal candidacy papers with the FEC and no campaign infrastructure or exploratory committee was visible. He continues his work with the voter mobilization organization 'Powered by People,' which he founded in 2019.\n\nThe 2026 Texas U.S. Senate election features incumbent Republican Senator John Cornyn seeking a fifth term. Cornyn faces a primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has already announced his campaign. On the Democratic side, while O'Rourke is publicly considering a run, other figures like former Congressman Colin Allred have also been mentioned as potential candidates, though none had formally entered the race as of late May 2025.\n\nHistorical timelines for major Texas campaigns show variation. For the 2024 Senate race, Democrat Colin Allred announced his candidacy in May 2023, 17 months before the election. Beto O'Rourke's own record includes announcing his 2018 Senate bid 20 months early (March 2017) and his 2022 gubernatorial run 12 months early (November 2021). The question's deadline of July 1, 2025, is approximately 16 months prior to the November 2026 general election.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "39 days (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, Beto O'Rourke has not announced his candidacy for the US Senate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "O'Rourke continues his 'listening tour' and work with 'Powered by People' past the July 1st deadline. He may ultimately decide the political climate is unfavorable, that another candidate has a better chance, or that he needs more time to build support, thus delaying any potential announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following his public comments, O'Rourke's internal polling and fundraising signals are overwhelmingly positive. He decides to capitalize on this momentum and preempt other potential Democratic candidates by formally declaring his candidacy in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is centered on the conflict between Beto O'Rourke's past behavior and his current political situation. The primary evidence supporting a 'Yes' outcome is his campaign announcement history. The July 1, 2025 deadline is 16 months before the November 2026 election. This fits squarely between his 2018 Senate announcement (20 months prior) and his 2022 gubernatorial announcement (12 months prior), making the timing highly plausible. His recent public statements, while non-committal, explicitly confirm he is considering a run, which is a necessary precondition for an announcement.\n\nHowever, there are significant factors weighing against a pre-July 1 announcement, which inform the status quo 'No' outcome. O'Rourke is coming off three consecutive high-profile losses (Senate '18, President '20, Governor '22), which likely creates caution among both his team and potential donors. He may need a longer period to gauge genuine support and rebuild his coalition before committing to another arduous campaign. Furthermore, as of late May 2025, there is no public evidence of the necessary campaign infrastructure, such as an exploratory committee or key staff hires, which typically precedes a major campaign launch. With only five weeks until the deadline, the absence of this activity is a notable negative indicator.\n\nI am setting the probability below 50% because the headwinds from past losses and the current lack of organizational groundwork seem more significant than the historical timeline precedent. A more cautious, longer exploratory phase is a more likely strategy for a candidate in his position than a swift announcement.\n\nMy forecast would increase with any reports of O'Rourke hiring senior campaign staff or filing paperwork to form an exploratory committee. It would decrease if another prominent Democrat, like Colin Allred, were to announce first, as this would complicate O'Rourke's strategic calculus and potentially delay his decision.",
