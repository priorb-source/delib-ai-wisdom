    "review": "Both forecasters raise a critical point I missed: the Korea Herald article is from late 2022, meaning negotiations have been ongoing for over 2 years without any announcement or substantive progress reports. This is a game-changing piece of information. Forecaster 2 correctly notes that major arms deals typically feature a crescendo of diplomatic visits, leaks, and official statements before announcement - none of which we've seen. The complete absence of follow-up reporting in 2+ years is indeed a very strong negative signal. Forecaster 3 adds valuable context about first-of-a-kind sales facing additional hurdles and Vietnam's cautious procurement process. Both also correctly emphasize the tight 2-month window and status quo bias. Their forecasts of 30-32% reflect appropriate skepticism given this timeline. I had incorrectly treated the Korea Herald report as relatively recent news, which led me to overestimate the probability of near-term conclusion.",
    "rationale": "The critical revelation that negotiations have been ongoing since late 2022 (2+ years) without any public progress fundamentally changes my assessment. For a $300 million first-ever defense sale between these countries, the complete lack of follow-up reporting, diplomatic activity, or official statements is a very strong negative indicator. This suggests either the talks have stalled, hit major obstacles, or been deprioritized by one or both parties. The timeline is also extremely tight - only 2 months remain, and complex defense agreements rarely materialize suddenly without preceding signals. However, I don't want to go quite as low as 30-32% because: (1) the question only requires an announcement of agreement, not delivery or implementation; (2) arms negotiations can occur in relative secrecy before sudden announcements; (3) the underlying strategic rationale remains sound for both countries; and (4) there's still a non-trivial possibility of a breakthrough in the next two months, perhaps timed to a diplomatic event. The absence of information cuts both ways - while it suggests stalled talks, it doesn't definitively prove the deal is dead. I'm updating my forecast down from 40% to 34%, reflecting the strong negative signal of the prolonged timeline while maintaining modest probability for a surprise announcement.",
