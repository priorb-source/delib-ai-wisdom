    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (61 days until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Russia does not invade any new country and the US makes no such accusation",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia remains focused on its war in Ukraine without opening new fronts. The conflict stays geographically contained. Any Russian military movements in already-occupied territories like Transnistria or Georgia don't constitute new invasions. Belarus continues hosting Russian forces with consent. No US accusations of new Russian invasions occur.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Russia sends ground forces into Moldova (possibly expanding from Transnistria) or escalates in Georgia without the government's consent. Alternatively, an unexpected move against a Baltic state or other neighbor occurs. The US government publicly and clearly accuses Russia of invasion, meeting the resolution criteria before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "This forecast has an extremely short time horizon of only 2 months, which strongly favors the status quo. Several factors point to a very low probability: (1) Russia is heavily committed in Ukraine with degraded military capacity, making a new invasion operationally difficult; (2) Since February 2022, Russia has not invaded any additional countries despite over 3 years passing; (3) Opening a new front would represent a massive escalation with severe international consequences; (4) There are no clear warning signs or military buildups suggesting imminent action against other countries; (5) The world changes slowly - dramatic geopolitical shifts typically require longer timeframes. The most plausible scenario would involve Moldova/Transnistria, where Russia already has forces, but even this would require preparation we'd likely detect. Belarus hosts Russian forces with consent, so wouldn't qualify. Baltic states are NATO members, making invasion extremely unlikely due to Article 5 implications. My research assistant provided no additional information suggesting elevated risk. For this probability to be higher, we'd need evidence of: significant Russian troop movements near borders of other countries, deteriorating diplomatic relations beyond current levels, or specific intelligence warnings. For it to be lower, we'd need absolute certainty about Russian intentions and capabilities, which we cannot have. The 5% accounts for irreducible uncertainty and low-probability tail risks while heavily weighting the strong status quo.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the United States accuse Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News [Ukraine war: Which countries could Putin go for next? Is Europe vulnerable to a nuclear-armed bully? Your questions answered](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-which-countries-could-putin-go-for-next-is-europe-vulnerable-to-a-nuclear-armed-bully-your-questions-answered-13317497)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine, by Russia sending its ground military forces into that country without consent from the government of the country.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
