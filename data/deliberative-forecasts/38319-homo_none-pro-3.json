    "review": "All three forecasters have arrived at the identical probability of 45% through nearly identical reasoning. The core arguments are unanimous: the industrial production index is a volatile series, the large 7.6% increase in March followed two months of decline, and the statistical principle of reversion to the mean suggests that a subsequent pullback or consolidation is more likely than continued strong growth. Forecaster 2's explicit mention of the March figure creating a 'high base' for April is a useful framing, but it's fundamentally part of the same mean-reversion logic we all employed. No forecaster introduced new evidence or a line of reasoning that I hadn't already considered. The strong consensus buttresses the original analysis rather than challenging it.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from the other two forecasters, I am maintaining my forecast of 45%. The deliberation process has strongly reinforced my initial reasoning. The fact that two other experts, working with the same limited information, independently arrived at the exact same conclusion provides a powerful signal that the initial assessment is well-calibrated. My rationale remains centered on the principle of mean reversion. The exceptionally strong 7.6% month-over-month increase in March sets a high statistical bar for April. Such large swings in volatile economic data are often followed by a correction or a pause, not another month of growth. While the momentum from March makes a 'Yes' outcome very plausible (hence a 45% probability and not lower), the lack of any additional supporting evidence for a sustained recovery makes a 'No' outcome slightly more likely. Since no new arguments or data were presented to alter this fundamental calculus, I see no reason to change my forecast.",
