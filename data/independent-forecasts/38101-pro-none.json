    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A major political scandal erupts in the UK involving the Labour government, causing Keir Starmer's approval rating to plummet. Simultaneously, Shiguru Ishiba's government successfully navigates a minor diplomatic crisis, giving him a modest and temporary boost in popularity. By July 1, 2025, Starmer's rating falls below Ishiba's.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Political trends in both the UK and Japan continue on their current trajectory. Keir Starmer's approval rating either remains stable or sees a slight, predictable decline typical for a leader one year in office. Shiguru Ishiba's approval remains low due to the persistent unpopularity of the ruling LDP party. On July 1, 2025, Starmer's rating remains comfortably above Ishiba's.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the current significant gap in approval ratings between the two leaders and the short time remaining until the resolution date. As of late May 2025, Keir Starmer's approval rating is estimated to be in the mid-30s, while Shiguru Ishiba's is considerably lower, likely in the low-20s. This double-digit lead for Starmer is the most critical factor. Over a short one-month period, the status quo is a strong predictor. For a 'No' outcome, we would need to see a rapid and substantial shift in public opinion in both countries, which is improbable without a major catalyzing event. Starmer's rating, while likely past its post-election peak, is unlikely to collapse precipitously in one month absent a major scandal. Conversely, Ishiba's approval is structurally suppressed by the ongoing LDP funding scandal and the general long-term trend of low approval for Japanese Prime Ministers. A sudden surge in his popularity is highly unlikely. The research assistant's report of no additional information reinforces a reliance on these established public trends. My probability is not higher than 85% to account for the inherent volatility of politics; an unforeseen scandal or a major international event could still cause a rapid shift in polling. My probability is not lower because the combination of Starmer's significant lead and the structural impediments to Ishiba's popularity makes the current trend very likely to hold for another month.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
