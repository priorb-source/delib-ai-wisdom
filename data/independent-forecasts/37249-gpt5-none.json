    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (from May 1, 2025 until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Labour remains ahead in Politico’s UK poll-of-polls; Reform UK does not reach #1 by a 4+ point margin in May–June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Polling averages remain broadly similar to the post-2024-election pattern: Labour maintains a clear lead; Conservatives and Reform vie for second/third with Reform in the mid-teens to low-20s at best. Even if Reform inches up, Politico’s smoothing prevents a sudden +4 lead over Labour within the short window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major, sustained shock rapidly shifts vote intention: e.g., a severe scandal or economic crisis cripples the Labour government, Conservative support collapses further with defections to Reform, and Reform consolidates the right, producing multiple consecutive national polls showing Reform in the high 20s/30s while Labour drops to the mid/low 20s—enough for Politico’s average to show Reform leading by 4+ points before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline context: Since the July 2024 election, Labour has consistently led UK national voting intention, with the Conservatives depressed and Reform elevated versus historic minor-party norms but still well short of Labour. Moving a poll-of-polls lead by more than 4 points in favor of Reform within just two months would require extraordinary and sustained polling across multiple firms. Politico’s methodology (an averaged trend) dampens short-lived spikes; it takes repeated, corroborating polls to produce a 4+ point average lead. Structural hurdles: Reform’s ceiling is constrained by brand perceptions, first-past-the-post dynamics, and competition with the Conservatives for right-leaning voters. For Reform not only to overtake Labour but also lead by 4+ in the average, the Conservatives would likely need to crater further and Labour would need a rare, acute collapse—both simultaneously. While The Hill’s framing highlights Reform’s momentum, that mainly implies pressure on the Conservatives, not eclipsing Labour decisively. Why not higher? Because it requires multiple low-probability conditions (Labour collapse + Tory implosion + rapid consolidation behind Reform) to occur and persist long enough to shift an averaged series. Why not lower? Non-zero tail risk exists: an unforeseen scandal, economic shock, major policy crisis, or a dramatic realignment (e.g., a de facto or formal pact/merger with the Conservatives under Farage) could catalyze a sudden polling surge. Update triggers upward: multiple reputable polls within days showing Reform clearly first by high-single digits; visible Conservative defections/leadership turmoil consolidating voters under Reform; a severe, sticky crisis eroding Labour’s support by 10+ points. Update triggers downward: continued stable Labour lead; Reform stagnating or slipping; any Tory recovery. Research assistant provided no additional information; thus, I weight status quo patterns and structural inertia more heavily.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Reform UK be the highest polling party in the UK by at least 4 points, according to Politico?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Hill: [Nigel Farage’s Reform UK is upending British politics](https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5163853-how-nigel-farages-reform-uk-is-upending-british-politics/) | Wikipedia: [Reform UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reform_UK)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Reform UK reaches #1 in the polling averages, exceeding the 2nd place by 4 or more percentage points [according to Politico](https://www.politico.eu/europe-poll-of-polls/united-kingdom/), after April 30, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
