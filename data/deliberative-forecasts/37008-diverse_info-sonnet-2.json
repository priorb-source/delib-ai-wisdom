    "review": "Forecaster 2 raised a critical point I had overlooked: Samoa's institutional history of rolling monthly SOE extensions during prolonged crises (COVID example). This historical precedent significantly affects the probability because it demonstrates both administrative comfort with extensions and an established pattern. This is strong evidence that extensions are a normal tool in Samoa's crisis management toolkit. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the 16% GDP economic cost is also valuable context I hadn't quantified - this creates a strong political incentive against extension. However, Forecaster 3 may be underweighting the institutional precedent and the practical difficulty of resolving infrastructure crises on schedule. The key tension is between the explicit scheduled end date (and lack of announced extension with only 9 days remaining) versus the historical pattern of rolling extensions and the persistence of the underlying crisis through August.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast upward but not as high as Forecaster 2's 58%. The historical precedent of rolling monthly SOE extensions is compelling institutional evidence that makes extensions more likely than I initially assessed. Additionally, even if temporary generators arrive on schedule, the government may still need emergency powers for rationing and resource allocation until the permanent solution is ready in August. However, several factors prevent me from going above 45%: (1) We're only 9 days out with no announced extension - governments typically signal these decisions earlier; (2) The 16% GDP cost creates strong pressure to end the emergency; (3) The COVID comparison may not fully apply as that involved ongoing uncertainty, whereas this crisis has a defined temporary solution timeline. The status quo scheduled end still carries significant weight, but the institutional history and persistent underlying crisis justify meaningfully higher probability than my initial 32%. I'm settling on 42% as a middle ground that respects both the scheduled expiration and the realistic possibility of extension given historical patterns and ongoing infrastructure challenges.",
