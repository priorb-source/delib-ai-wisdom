  "information": "Brent Metz, a 39-year-old town councilman in Mountain View, Colorado, pleaded not guilty to felony charges related to the shooting of a 17-year-old high school student in September 2024. According to investigators, Metz shot the teen in the face while the teen was sitting in his car outside Metz's home, where he had been trying to take homecoming dance pictures. A Jefferson County Sheriff’s spokesperson stated that there was no indication the teen intended to commit any crime. Metz took a leave of absence from the council after the shooting.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8–9 days (recall election May 20, 2025; unofficial results likely same night or next day)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall succeeds and Metz loses the seat",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Motivated recall backers dominate a low-salience special election in a very small electorate; voters punish Metz for the shooting incident and ongoing felony case; the recall passes and he is removed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Voters reject the recall as premature while charges are pending, or accept Metz’s account; his supporters effectively mobilize in a tiny-town contest (potentially aided by mail voting), and the recall fails so he retains the seat.",
    "rationale": "Key facts: According to your research assistant, Metz pleaded not guilty to felony charges after allegedly shooting a 17-year-old in the face in Sept 2024; investigators reported no indication the teen intended a crime. Metz took a leave of absence and is now facing a May 20 recall. In very small municipalities, recall outcomes are often driven by motivated turnout and salient controversies. Base rates for local recalls are roughly around a coin flip to somewhat higher success for recall proponents, and when the trigger is a high-salience scandal involving alleged violence, success rates tend to be higher than average. Status quo/trajectory: The salient, negative narrative (teen shot in face; pending felonies; leave of absence) favors recall proponents. With only days left, there’s limited time for sentiment to shift. Why not higher than my probability (i.e., why not predict Metz retains his seat more often): • Optics are extremely unfavorable; the sheriff’s comment that there was no apparent crime by the teen undercuts a self-defense narrative. • Recall campaigns in tiny electorates benefit from motivated oppositional turnout. • Pending felony charges keep the issue front-of-mind. Why not lower (i.e., why not near-certain recall): • Very small electorates are volatile; a few dozen votes can swing the outcome. • Some voters may view a recall as premature before the court case concludes, or oppose recalls on principle. • Colorado elections frequently use mail ballots, which can broaden participation and add uncertainty. What would move me upward (higher chance he retains): • Credible polling or public endorsements from respected local figures opposing the recall. • Evidence of high, broad turnout (beyond activist networks), or visible pro-Metz organizing. • Legal developments favoring Metz (e.g., charges reduced/dismissed or exculpatory information). What would move me downward (lower chance he retains): • Additional damaging facts, victim statements, or official condemnations. • Clear signs of strong recall GOTV and low general turnout. • Loss of institutional or community support (e.g., local civic groups urging recall). Given the high-salience controversy, base rates for local recalls, and the tiny, mobilization-sensitive electorate, I moderately favor the recall to succeed while allowing substantial uncertainty.",
