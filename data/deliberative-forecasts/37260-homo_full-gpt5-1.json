    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the decisive constraints: no application filed, only the Federal Constitutional Court can ban a party, and such proceedings are lengthy. New elements they highlighted that I hadn’t explicitly weighed: (1) the 2017 NPD “capability” criterion, which raises the substantive bar; (2) explicit acknowledgment that there’s no executive shortcut; (3) concrete update triggers (e.g., filing plus Court-announced expedited schedule). These points reinforce that the near-term path to a ban is effectively blocked. Their tail-risk scenarios (sudden crisis, emergency fast-track) remain theoretically possible but unprecedented and still time‑constrained.",
    "rationale": "My prior reasoning already placed dominant weight on the absence of a filing and the Court’s historical pace. The added emphasis on the NPD capability standard further reduces plausibility within the short window, even if an application appeared. With ~60 days left and no sign of cross‑institutional will or an expedited court path, a ban by July 1 is extraordinarily unlikely. I maintain a very small residual for a shock that produces immediate filing and unprecedented Court action, but I see no basis to raise that tail above my prior estimate. Accordingly, I do not update.",
