    "review": "The deliberation reveals a very strong consensus. All three forecasters identified the exact same core thesis: the company's obligation to report Q1 earnings in May is a powerful forcing function that almost certainly guarantees a news post, making a 'No' outcome highly probable. The arguments presented by the other two forecasters were not novel to my own analysis, but the unanimity in reasoning increases my confidence in this central conclusion. We all identified the same two primary tail risks: a delay of the earnings report into June, or a change in communication strategy where the post is made elsewhere on the site. Forecaster 2's slightly lower forecast of 7% is compelling as it suggests a slightly higher degree of confidence that these tail risks will not materialize, a conclusion I now share.",
    "rationale": "My initial analysis, like that of the other forecasters, was centered on the high probability of a Q1 earnings announcement being posted to the News page in May, as is standard practice for a public company. The consensus in our deliberation has reinforced the strength of this argument. Upon reflection prompted by the other analyses, I've re-evaluated the small tail risks. The SEC filing deadline for the Q1 10-Q form is typically 40-45 days after the quarter-end (March 31), which places it squarely in mid-May. This regulatory pressure makes a delay of the earnings announcement into June even less likely than I initially estimated. Additionally, a quick check of the investor relations section of their website confirms that it links directly to the '/news' page for press releases, minimizing the risk of the announcement being posted elsewhere. Given that the consensus strengthens the core argument and a closer look reduces the perceived likelihood of the tail risks, I am increasing my confidence in a 'No' outcome. Consequently, I am lowering my forecast for a 'Yes' outcome from 10% to 7%, aligning with Forecaster 2.",
