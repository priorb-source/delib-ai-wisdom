    "review": "All three forecasters converged on the 60-65% range, which strengthens my confidence in this probability band. The analyses are remarkably similar, identifying the same key factors: the 33-day window is substantial, ongoing war creates diplomatic necessity, Trump's unconventional approach and complicated history with Zelenskyy introduce uncertainty, and alternative communication methods exist. Forecaster 3 raises a valuable point about base rates - sitting US presidents typically communicate with critical allied leaders at least monthly during crises. However, this is already embedded in my reasoning. More importantly, all of us are operating without concrete information about recent communication patterns or whether any calls occurred around May 12, which means we're relying on general principles rather than specific evidence. Forecaster 3's slightly lower 60% acknowledges this information gap, but I find the arguments for 65% remain compelling: the one-month window combined with active war dynamics makes at least one call more likely than not, even accounting for relationship complexity.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find no compelling reason to significantly adjust my forecast. The convergence at 60-65% validates the key considerations: (1) 33 days provides ample opportunity for routine diplomatic contact; (2) Ukraine's dependence on US support during active conflict creates natural pressure for leader-level communication; (3) Trump's unconventional diplomacy and the complicated relationship history introduce genuine uncertainty; (4) alternative channels (intermediaries, in-person meetings) could substitute for phone calls. The lack of information about recent communication patterns cuts both ways - it could indicate infrequent contact OR simply reflect our blind spot. Given normal diplomatic practices during wartime and the substantial time window, I maintain that a phone call is more likely than not, but the relationship dynamics and communication uncertainty prevent higher confidence. The 65% forecast appropriately balances these factors.",
