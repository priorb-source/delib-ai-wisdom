  "information": "In January 2025, Databricks completed a major funding round, raising over $15.25 billion. This included a $10 billion Series J equity financing round, which valued the company at $62 billion, and an additional $5.25 billion in debt financing provided by several major banks. New investors in the equity round included Meta as a strategic partner. The funding is intended to accelerate the development of new AI products, expand market reach, and finance acquisitions. A portion of the funds was also designated to offer liquidity to current and former employees.\n\nDatabricks has an upcoming Data + AI Summit scheduled for June 9-12, 2025. Keynote speakers announced for the event include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Anthropic, and Microsoft. Previously, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi had described 2024 as a \"dumb\" year for IPOs and has made statements suggesting flexibility on the timing of a public offering, mentioning both 2025 and 2026 as possibilities. A January 2025 report noted that a public offering within a year \"wouldn't be a huge surprise.\"\n\nAs of late May 2025, there have been no public reports of Databricks selecting underwriters for an IPO or of the company making a confidential S-1 filing with the SEC. Market sentiment has been described as uncertain, with some IPO advisors noting that while planning is occurring, macroeconomic concerns might cause delays. Other major tech startups, such as Stripe, have also remained private despite IPO expectations. In contrast, companies like Klarna and eToro have reportedly filed confidential IPO paperwork.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks and 2 days remain until the July 1, 2025 deadline (current date is May 22, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No IPO announcement. Currently there are no public indications that Databricks has filed an SEC Form S-1 or made any announcement on their website regarding IPO plans",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks continues operating as a private company through June 2025 without making any IPO announcement. The company leverages its recently raised $15.25 billion in funding to continue operations and product development, viewing market conditions as still uncertain. Management decides to wait until later in 2025 or 2026 for more favorable conditions before announcing IPO plans",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "During the Data + AI Summit (June 9-12, 2025), Databricks surprises the market by announcing IPO plans, or alternatively files a Form S-1 with the SEC in mid-to-late June. The company decides that strong business momentum and positive reception at the summit justify moving forward with IPO plans despite earlier caution",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Several factors support this assessment: First, Databricks just completed a massive $15.25 billion funding round in January 2025, which significantly reduces any near-term urgency to access public markets for capital. Second, as of late May 2025, there are no reports of the company selecting underwriters or making confidential SEC filings - typical prerequisites that occur months before IPO announcements. Third, with only 5 weeks remaining until the deadline, the window is extremely tight. Fourth, market conditions are described as uncertain with macroeconomic concerns potentially causing delays. Fifth, the CEO has previously expressed flexibility about timing, mentioning both 2025 and 2026 as possibilities, and characterized 2024 as a 'dumb' year for IPOs, suggesting a cautious approach to market timing. The one potential catalyst is the Data + AI Summit scheduled for June 9-12, which could theoretically serve as a venue for such an announcement. However, major IPO announcements are typically made through formal channels rather than at company conferences, and the presence of high-profile CEO speakers suggests the focus will be on business partnerships and product announcements. My forecast is not higher because: the Summit does provide a window, and a January 2025 report suggested an IPO within a year 'wouldn't be a huge surprise,' keeping alive some possibility. My forecast is not lower because: there is still a major company event before the deadline, and surprises do occasionally happen in the IPO market. To update higher, I would need to see: news of underwriter selection, leaks about confidential filings, or explicit signals from management about near-term IPO timing. To update lower, I would need: explicit statements ruling out near-term IPO plans or further market deterioration",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn January 2025, Databricks completed a major funding round, raising over $15.25 billion.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
