    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks (≈38 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the HTS entry 9903.01.60 continues to display an additional ad valorem duty of 31% for products of Switzerland in column 1-General.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Between now and June 1, the administration or USITC revises or renumbers the entry so that 9903.01.60 no longer shows 31% for Switzerland (e.g., the rate is changed, the country is removed from that subheading, or the provision is deleted/renumbered such that 9903.01.60 no longer contains the 31% listing).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The HTS remains as currently configured through June 1, with subheading 9903.01.60 showing an additional 31% duty for articles the product of Switzerland (even if marked suspended).",
    "rationale": "- Framing: Resolution hinges on what the HTS displays alongside 9903.01.60 on or after June 1, 2025, not on whether the duty is in force. Suspension status is irrelevant; the key is that the rate shown is 31% for Switzerland.\n- Status quo/recency: The April reporting indicates a specific, unusual rate (31%) for Switzerland as part of the administration’s new tariff actions. Such specificity and the explicit subheading reference suggest the entry has been or is being codified in Chapter 99. Once USITC posts a Chapter 99 entry, it typically remains stable over short horizons unless superseded by a subsequent proclamation.\n- Inertia and timeline: Only ~5 weeks remain. HTS changes require formal action (presidential proclamation/FR notice) and USITC updates. Rapid reversal or renumbering within this short window, especially for a relatively small bilateral relationship, is uncommon. Courts may enjoin enforcement, but that usually does not immediately force the HTS to remove or alter the posted rate; and suspension doesn’t affect resolution here.\n- Risks pushing to No: (1) The underlying measure might still be in a proposal stage rather than fully codified—if it hasn’t been formally implemented, the HTS may not show 31% by June 1. (2) A fast policy revision that changes the rate or migrates Switzerland to a different 9903 subheading, leaving 9903.01.60 without the 31% listing. (3) An unusual USITC housekeeping change that renumbers entries before June 1.\n- Why not higher: Nontrivial uncertainty about whether the 31% has already been formally embedded in the HTS and the possibility of quick administrative tweaks while the new tariff program is being calibrated. Also, the exact anchoring to 9903.01.60 creates tail risk if the rate gets moved to a differently numbered subheading.\n- Why not lower: The short time horizon, typical stability of HTS postings once published, and the political signaling value of the new tariff architecture argue for persistence through June 1.\n- What would move me up: Confirmation via Federal Register/USITC that 9903.01.60 currently displays 31% for Switzerland; evidence of finalized proclamations with effective dates spanning June 1. \n- What would move me down: Credible reporting or official notices indicating the measure is being revised, renumbered, or not yet codified in the HTS; USITC updates replacing 9903.01.60 or altering the listed percentage before June 1.\n- Research assistant: No additional information provided beyond the prompt; thus, I weight general process/inertia and the NYT reporting context.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tariff schedule list the tariff on Switzerland as 31% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Swiss Indignant to Make the Top 10 of Trump’s Tariffs List](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/trump-tariffs-switzerland.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 31% for Switzerland at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=switzerland) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this question is asking whether the cell in the 'RATES OF DUTY' column '1, General' appearing alongside subheading 9903.01.60 on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule indicates an additional ad valorem duty rate of 31% for articles the product of Switzerland, regardless of any specificities noted in the 'Article Description' column.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
