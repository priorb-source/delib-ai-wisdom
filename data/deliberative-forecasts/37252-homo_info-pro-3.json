    "review": "All three forecasters agree that the probability is high, anchoring on the extreme political volatility in South Korea. Forecaster 2 correctly identifies the upcoming June 3rd snap presidential election as a significant, specific catalyst for mass mobilization, which strengthens the case for a 'Yes' outcome. However, Forecaster 3 provides the most compelling and decisive evidence. They point to a high-frequency base rate of at least four qualifying protests between January and April 2025, and critically, they note that the May 1st protest (the first day of the forecast period) has already occurred with police estimates of up to 13,000 attendees. This shifts the core of the question from 'will a protest occur?' to 'will the qualifying protest be reported in time?'.",
    "rationale": "I am increasing my forecast from 85% to 90%. Forecaster 3's data-driven argument is highly persuasive. My initial forecast correctly identified the high likelihood of an event, but their evidence of a consistent monthly base rate of qualifying protests and, most importantly, a likely qualifying event having already occurred on May 1st, significantly reduces the uncertainty. The primary risk is no longer the event's occurrence but the reporting speed and methodology of the Global Protest Tracker. Given the two-month window until resolution, it is highly probable that a major, widely-covered event like the May Day rally will be documented by the source. The upcoming June 3rd election, as highlighted by Forecaster 2, provides a strong secondary catalyst, ensuring that even if the May 1st event is somehow missed, another is very likely to occur. I am aligning with Forecaster 3's 90% probability, as it appropriately reflects the near-certainty of a qualifying event while retaining a 10% buffer for reporting failure or an unexpected and sudden de-escalation of political tensions.",
