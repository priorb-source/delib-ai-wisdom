    "review": "The deliberation highlighted a critical point of disagreement in interpreting the resolution criteria. Forecaster 3 argued that 'A protest... active at the launch of this question does not count' means an entirely new protest *movement* is required, which led to their low 20% forecast. I find this interpretation overly restrictive; the criteria focus on 'a protest' with a 'start date,' suggesting a specific, discrete event. A new demonstration, even if related to an ongoing issue like the land law, should qualify if it has a start date after May 2nd. Therefore, I find Forecaster 3's core argument unconvincing. However, both Forecaster 2 and 3 made a very persuasive case that I had under-weighted the short (<2 month) timeframe and the significant risk of a reporting lag from the Global Protest Tracker. These two factors introduce much more uncertainty than I initially accounted for.",
    "rationale": "I am revising my forecast downward from 70% to 58%. This significant adjustment is a direct result of the deliberation. My core thesis remains that India's high base rate for large-scale protests makes a 'Yes' outcome likely. However, my peers convinced me that my initial forecast did not adequately discount two key constraints. First, the two-month window is very short, and a period of relative calm without a single new mass mobilization is plausible. Second, the reliance on a single, non-real-time source (the Global Protest Tracker) introduces a critical reporting lag risk; a protest could occur in late June but not be documented before the July 1st deadline. While I still reject Forecaster 3's strict interpretation of the rules, their analysis prompted a more careful consideration of what constitutes a 'new' protest event. My updated forecast of 58% still favors a 'Yes' outcome due to the low 10,000-participant threshold (modest for India) and existing political tensions, but it now reflects the substantial uncertainty introduced by the short timeframe and reporting methodology.",
