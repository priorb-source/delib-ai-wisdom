    "review": "The other forecasters provided valuable perspectives that I had not fully weighted in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2 correctly identified a range of uncertainties, including the potential for the UN to reduce its personnel, which would lower the risk exposure. Forecaster 3 introduced two crucial and somewhat opposing points: the significant downside risk of OCHA changing or ceasing its reporting cadence (which would lock the result at 295, a 'No'), and the upside potential from retroactive confirmations of prior deaths being added to the official tally (which makes reaching 300 more likely, even without new incidents). I found Forecaster 3's reasoning particularly compelling, as it highlighted a key procedural failure mode for my forecast that I had overlooked. While I agree with the uncertainties raised by Forecaster 2, I believe their 65% forecast is too low given that only five additional reported fatalities are needed. The arguments presented by Forecaster 3 prompted me to reconsider the robustness of a high-confidence forecast.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 88% was based primarily on the high probability of at least five new fatalities occurring over the two-month period, given the extremely low threshold and the ongoing high-risk environment. After deliberation, I am adjusting my forecast downward to 83%. The main reason for this five-point reduction is to properly account for the procedural risk highlighted by Forecaster 3: OCHA could cease issuing these specific impact snapshots before July 1, 2025. In that scenario, the last reported figure of 295 would stand, and the question would resolve 'No'. While I assess this as unlikely given OCHA's consistent reporting cadence during the crisis, it is a non-trivial possibility. I did not lower my forecast further because Forecaster 3 also raised the excellent point about retroactive confirmations. This acts as a counterweight to the procedural risk, as previously unconfirmed deaths could be added to the tally in the next report, meaning the threshold could be crossed even in a period of relative calm. The fundamental situation remains unchanged: the number of additional reported deaths required is extremely small (5) relative to the number that have already occurred (295). Therefore, my confidence in a 'Yes' resolution remains high, but is now tempered by the procedural uncertainties.",
