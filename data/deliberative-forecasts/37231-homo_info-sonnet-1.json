    "review": "Both forecasters arrived independently at 65%, considerably lower than my 93%. The key discrepancy is in our baseline data. Forecaster 2 references a baseline of 2.8% with only 0.2 percentage points of buffer, while Forecaster 3 explicitly states they lack access to recent February-March 2025 data. However, my research assistant provided specific March 2025 data showing 2.2% unemployment from Inegi - a full 0.6 percentage points lower than what the other forecasters are using. This dramatically changes the analysis. With a 2.2% baseline, we have 0.8 percentage points of buffer, not 0.2. An increase of 0.8+ percentage points in a single month would be unprecedented absent a major economic crisis. The other forecasters make valid points about tariff impacts and economic headwinds, but correctly note these effects take 3-6 months to manifest fully. All forecasters agree we're already at April 29th, so the outcome is essentially determined. The other forecasters appear to be working with outdated or incomplete information, which explains their lower confidence. That said, they raise important considerations about data source uncertainty and potential revisions that warrant some moderation of my forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain high confidence but will moderate slightly. The critical factor is data quality: my research assistant provided March 2025 data (2.2%) that the other forecasters apparently lack. Forecaster 3 explicitly admits not having February-March 2025 data, and Forecaster 2's reference to a 2.8% baseline appears outdated. If Mexico's unemployment was indeed 2.2% in March 2025 with a downward trend (2.5% Feb → 2.2% March), an April increase to 3.0% or higher would require an extraordinary 0.8+ percentage point jump - something that doesn't occur without major economic shocks. While the other forecasters correctly identify tariff-related headwinds, they also note these impacts typically lag 3-6 months. Since we're measuring April and it's already April 29th, any recent tariff announcements wouldn't have fully materialized in April employment data. However, I should account for: (1) possible discrepancies between Inegi and Trading Economics data sources, (2) potential data revisions, (3) the wisdom of crowds suggesting I may have blind spots. These considerations warrant a modest downward adjustment from 93%, but the fundamental strength of having recent data showing 2.2% in March with a consistent downward trend remains compelling.",
