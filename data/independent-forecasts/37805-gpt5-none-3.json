    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (≈42 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — SPN currently has only a small handful of scheduled non-stop destinations (e.g., Guam and a couple of Korean cities), fewer than the 5 needed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The summer 2025 schedule holds with Guam plus 1–3 Korea routes (ICN, possibly PUS and/or another Korean secondary city), and no additional Japan/Philippines/China or inter-island services appear in the OAG/FlightsFrom listing by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "By July 1, at least two more destinations are listed on FlightsFrom, for example a resumed Japan route (e.g., Narita) and Manila, or multiple additional Korean secondary-city routes, or scheduled inter-island services to Rota/Tinian being reflected in OAG and thus counted by FlightsFrom.",
    "rationale": "- Short horizon: There are only ~6 weeks until the check date. Airline adds or resumptions typically publish and sell weeks to months in advance, so late surprises that add multiple destinations are unlikely.\n- Status quo: SPN’s post-pandemic network has been thin and volatile. Reliable service has centered on Guam (UA) and Korean leisure routes (Jeju Air/T’way to ICN, sometimes PUS). Japan service has been limited or charter-heavy, and Philippines/China routes that existed pre-2019 have not durably returned. The linked background article points to ongoing struggles and suspensions, reinforcing a conservative base rate.\n- Threshold is high: To beat “>4,” SPN needs 5+ distinct destinations on FlightsFrom. If today’s effective count is ~2–4, that likely requires at least one or two new city pairs to be scheduled and visible in OAG by July 1.\n- Wild cards: If scheduled inter-island services to Rota (ROP) or Tinian (TIQ) were published in OAG and thus shown on FlightsFrom, they would count and could push the total over 4. However, recent inter-island operations have often been on-demand and may not appear as scheduled service on FlightsFrom.\nWhy not higher: The combination of short lead time, recent route suspensions, and the need for multiple additions makes a sudden jump to 5+ destinations improbable.\nWhy not lower: It’s plausible that summer Korean leisure capacity includes more than one secondary city, or that a Japan route resurfaces as scheduled, or that inter-island flights get listed, any of which could tip the count to 5.\nWhat would move me up: Credible announcements and published schedules (OAG/airline timetable) adding any two of: a Japan route (e.g., NRT), Manila, another Korean secondary city, or confirmed scheduled listings for Rota/Tinian on FlightsFrom.\nWhat would move me down: Evidence that Busan or a secondary Korean route is suspended for summer 2025, or confirmation that no inter-island flights will be displayed as scheduled on FlightsFrom.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 4 direct flight destinations from Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Northern Marianas struggles to revive tourism amid flight suspensions and travel restrictions: What you need to know?](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/northern-marianas-struggles-to-revive-tourism-amid-flight-suspensions-and-travel-restrictions-what-you-need-to-know/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 4 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Saipan (SPN)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/SPN) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
