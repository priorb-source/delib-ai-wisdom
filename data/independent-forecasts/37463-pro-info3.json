  "information": "Analysts from sources including NASDAQ and The Motley Fool have highlighted Amazon's growth potential, particularly through its cloud infrastructure service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is reportedly growing by a high-teens percentage year-over-year. In May 2025, both JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley raised their target price for Amazon stock to $230.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one week. The 13F filing for the quarter ending March 31, 2025, is due to be filed with the SEC by May 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Berkshire Hathaway's last reported holding was exactly 10,000,000 shares. The status quo is that they did not change this holding during Q1 2025, which would mean their holding is not greater than 10,000,000 shares.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway's investment managers made no changes to the company's Amazon stake in Q1 2025. They may have viewed the stock as fairly valued or preferred other capital allocation opportunities. The Q1 2025 13F filing consequently reports a holding of exactly 10,000,000 shares or fewer.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "During the first quarter of 2025, one of Berkshire's investment managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, identified an opportunity to increase the company's stake in Amazon. Driven by long-term conviction in businesses like AWS, they purchased additional shares, bringing the total holding to a number greater than 10,000,000.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily weights the status quo, as Berkshire Hathaway is known for its long-term, buy-and-hold investment strategy. Large, established positions like the one in Amazon are not frequently altered. The last reported filing showed exactly 10,000,000 shares, and the most probable outcome is that this position size was maintained through Q1 2025. The information from my research assistant about analyst price target increases in May 2025 is noted, but it occurred after the investment period in question and is unlikely to reflect Berkshire's independent, value-oriented decision-making process during Q1. Berkshire often acts contrarian and is not swayed by general market sentiment.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because the threshold for a 'Yes' outcome is extremely low—only one additional share purchased would trigger it. It is plausible that one of the investment managers, who have more latitude than Buffett himself, decided to add a small amount to the position based on their conviction in Amazon's future, such as the continued high-teens growth in AWS. Amazon is a high-quality business that fits the Berkshire mold, and a modest addition is always possible.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 15% because any active decision to purchase more shares requires a compelling valuation, which is something Amazon's stock has not frequently offered by Berkshire's traditional standards. The strong default action for Berkshire's portfolio is inaction, and I believe this inertia is the most powerful factor. For me to increase my forecast, I would need evidence of a significant, unexplained dip in Amazon's stock price during Q1 2025 that might have presented a unique buying opportunity. For me to decrease it, I would need to see public comments from Berkshire leadership from that period suggesting a general dissatisfaction with market valuations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Amazon stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nStockCircle: [Berkshire Hathaway's Amazon Stake](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett/amzn/transactions)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 10,000,000 shares of Amazon.com, Inc.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAnalysts from sources including NASDAQ and The Motley Fool have highlighted Amazon's growth potential, particularly through its cloud infrastructure service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is reportedly growing by a high-teens percentage year-over-year.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
