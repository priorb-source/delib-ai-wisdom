  "information": "According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Inegi), Mexico's unemployment rate reached a historic low of 2.2% in March 2025. This was a decrease from 2.3% in March 2024 and 2.5% in February 2025. The total number of unemployed individuals was 1.4 million. The economically active population (PEA) was reported at 61.1 million, with a participation rate of 59.3%. In contrast, the informal labor sector accounted for 54.4% of the workforce, and the number of underemployed individuals—those needing to work more hours—rose to 3.9 million, representing 6.6% of the employed population.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome should be known within approximately 1-3 weeks, as we are at the end of April 2025 and official unemployment statistics for April 2025 will be published by Inegi and reported on Trading Economics shortly.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - if the unemployment rate remains similar to March 2025 levels",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Mexico's unemployment rate would need to jump from 2.2% in March 2025 to 3.0% or higher in April 2025, representing an increase of at least 0.8 percentage points in a single month. This could occur if the US tariffs mentioned in the background article caused sudden, massive layoffs in the auto manufacturing sector and related supply chains, creating an immediate shock to the labor market.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mexico's unemployment rate continues at or near its March 2025 level of 2.2%, remaining well below the 3.0% threshold. This would represent a continuation of the declining trend observed over the past year (2.5% in Feb 2025, 2.3% in March 2024, 2.2% in March 2025).",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. Mexico's unemployment rate was at a historic low of 2.2% in March 2025, significantly below the 3.0% threshold. For a No outcome, the rate would need to increase by at least 0.8 percentage points (more than 36% relative increase) in just one month - an extremely rare occurrence absent a major economic catastrophe. Unemployment rates typically change gradually as they reflect aggregate labor market conditions across an entire economy. While the AP article mentions US tariffs affecting auto supply chains, there are several reasons why this is unlikely to cause such a dramatic one-month spike: (1) we're already at the end of April, so any major disruption would likely already be visible in early indicators; (2) even when tariffs cause job losses, the effects typically materialize over months, not days; (3) layoffs take time to process and show up in official statistics. The declining trend over the past year (2.5% → 2.3% → 2.2%) suggests underlying labor market strength. What would make me revise downward: credible reports of massive layoffs (hundreds of thousands) in Mexico during April, or early labor market indicators showing sharp deterioration. What would make me revise upward: confirmation that April data has been collected and shows continued low unemployment, or evidence that tariff impacts remain limited. Given the extremely low March baseline, the historical rarity of large month-to-month unemployment jumps, and the fact that we're essentially at the end of the measurement period, I assign a high probability to the Yes outcome.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mexico's unemployment rate be under 3% in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [US tariffs ripple through auto supply chains into Mexico](https://apnews.com/article/mexico-stellantis-trump-tariffs-sheinbaum-569ae29d203b1997d50a3a9655c928a8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mexico's unemployment rate is less than 3.0% for April 2025 according to data presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/mexico/unemployment-rate).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Inegi), Mexico's unemployment rate reached a historic low of 2.2% in March 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
