  "information": "This is a rematch for the UFC bantamweight title, scheduled to headline UFC 316 on June 7-8, 2025, in Newark, New Jersey. In their first fight at UFC 306 in September 2024, Merab Dvalishvili defeated Sean O'Malley by unanimous decision to win the championship. Commentator Joe Rogan has questioned how O'Malley gets past Dvalishvili's abilities, and former champion Henry Cejudo has referred to Dvalishvili as the greatest bantamweight of all time.\n\nMerab Dvalishvili is the current UFC bantamweight champion and is on a 12-fight winning streak. His last fight was a unanimous decision victory over Umar Nurmagomedov in January 2025, marking his first successful title defense. In the weeks leading up to the fight, Dvalishvili has reported suffering minor injuries to his finger and a toe on his right foot during training, but stated his intention to compete regardless.\n\nSean O'Malley is the former bantamweight champion. This fight will be his first since undergoing hip surgery in October 2024 following his loss to Dvalishvili. In preparation for the rematch, O'Malley has been sparring with former UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya. O'Malley has stated he is confident in his skills and expects to be significantly better than he was in the first fight post-surgery.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12 days (UFC 316 is June 7–8, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Dvalishvili wins again by decision after sustained wrestling pressure (fight proceeds as booked).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Late withdrawal or opponent change cancels the matchup; or O’Malley stays upright, lands clean counters, and wins by KO/TKO or outstrikes to a decision; or a draw/No Contest.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Fight goes ahead; Dvalishvili forces clinches, mat returns, and top control over five rounds, edging striking volume and control time to a clear decision or late ground-and-pound stoppage.",
    "rationale": "I decompose the forecast into (1) probability the bout happens as scheduled and (2) probability Dvalishvili wins if it happens. • Bout occurrence: With ~12 days to go, main-event cancellations are uncommon but non-trivial. Dvalishvili has minor finger/toe issues; O’Malley is coming off hip surgery. I put fight-go likelihood around 90% after factoring weigh-ins/medical checks. Because this market resolves No if the bout doesn’t occur or if Merab fights someone else, this attrition risk meaningfully pulls the Yes probability down. • If they fight: The prior head-to-head (Dvalishvili UD over O’Malley at UFC 306) plus Merab’s continued form (UD over Umar Nurmagomedov in Jan 2025 per RA) point to a style edge: elite pace, chain wrestling, clinch control, and cardio in 5 rounds. O’Malley’s win paths are (a) improved takedown defense and scrambles post-hip surgery and (b) high-precision counters producing a KO/TKO. He’s elite at range and reportedly has strong camp reps (e.g., with Adesanya), so his finishing equity is real. Still, the matchup historically favors Merab over 25 minutes. Allowing a small chance of draw/NC, I’m around 72% for Merab conditional on the fight occurring. Combined: 0.90 × 0.72 ≈ 0.65. Why not higher? Late-camp injury/withdrawal risk, O’Malley’s KO threat and potential TDD improvements, and small draw/NC probability. Why not lower? Recent dominant H2H, proven 5-round wrestling template against top opposition, and Merab’s momentum. What would move me: • Upward: clean bill of health at fight week, strong Merab open workout/weigh-in, reports of O’Malley’s TDD not holding in camp, or market/analytics moving decisively toward Merab. • Downward: any setback on Merab’s injuries, rumors of compromised weight cut, sharp betting toward O’Malley, or confirmation O’Malley’s mobility and defensive wrestling have markedly improved.",
