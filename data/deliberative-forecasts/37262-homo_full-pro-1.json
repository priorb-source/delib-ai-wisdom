    "review": "The other two forecasters reached the same conclusion (75%) based on similar evidence: India's protest history, multiple current flashpoints (farmers' rights, land/religious laws), and specific intelligence about a planned 10,000-person march. Their reasoning is convincing. The main difference from my initial analysis is the weight given to the uncertainties. Both forecasters seem less concerned than I was about the specific resolution criterion of the Global Protest Tracker. Forecaster 3 made a particularly persuasive point that a protest with 10,000+ participants would be highly newsworthy and thus very likely to be captured by the international media sources that the tracker monitors. This argument directly addresses one of my primary reasons for a more conservative forecast, which was the risk of the tracker simply missing the event. While a reporting lag remains a possibility, the risk of complete omission is smaller than I first estimated.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am updating my forecast upward. I was initially more cautious, placing significant weight on the risk that the Global Protest Tracker might fail to report a qualifying event in time. However, the other forecasters' arguments, especially the point that a 10,000+ person protest is a major news event unlikely to be missed, have convinced me that I was overweighting this specific risk. The core drivers for a 'Yes' outcome remain very strong: multiple, potent social and political grievances are active, and there is specific intelligence of groups already organizing at the required scale (the planned 10,000-farmer march). India's proven capacity for mass mobilization supports this. While the risks of government suppression and a reporting lag for a late-June event still exist, the high probability of a qualifying protest occurring in the first place justifies a higher confidence level. The consensus at 75% seems to strike the right balance between the strong positive signals and the remaining uncertainties. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast from 65% to 75%.",
