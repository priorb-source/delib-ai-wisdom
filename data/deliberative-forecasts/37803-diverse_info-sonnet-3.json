    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I reached similar conclusions (12% vs 15%), while Forecaster 3 is more bearish at 5%. Forecaster 3 raises the most compelling new evidence: historical precedent from Trump's first administration where similar websites remained offline for years. This is highly relevant and something I failed to consider. Forecaster 3 also mentions June hearings, which provide a potential pathway but with insufficient time before July 1 to drive restoration. Forecaster 2 makes an insightful technical point about redirects/placeholders - the resolution only requires the site to be 'online' per the checker, not fully functional. This creates a narrow pathway where a quick redirect could satisfy the criteria without reversing the policy. However, this seems like a low-probability bureaucratic workaround. The specific details about Climate Action 2030 rescission and $377m budget cuts reinforce the deliberate, systematic nature of the removal.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the arguments, I'm updating downward based primarily on the historical precedent evidence. During Trump's first term, similar sites remained offline for years - not weeks or months. This suggests these removals are treated as permanent policy decisions, not temporary measures. The 6-week timeline is extremely constraining for any reversal process. The June hearings mentioned by Forecaster 3 are too late and unlikely to produce binding action before July 1. Against lowering further: Forecaster 2's redirect/placeholder scenario remains plausible. Federal agencies sometimes create minimal placeholders for broken links or to address constituent complaints. Technical restoration is trivial if ordered. Some non-zero probability must remain for unexpected internal dynamics or external pressure we cannot observe. However, the weight of evidence - explicit policy direction, concrete budget cuts, historical precedent, and the short timeline - argues for a lower forecast than my original 12%. I'm settling on 8%, splitting the difference between my initial view and Forecaster 3's more pessimistic assessment.",
