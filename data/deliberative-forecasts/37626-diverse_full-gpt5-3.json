    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a useful emphasis on the knife-edge: from March’s 62.5¢, only a 0.5¢ uptick breaches the threshold. They also stress that May will be the first full month post-tariff, increasing the likelihood of pass-through. I find this persuasive and a nontrivial downside risk I should weight a bit more. Forecaster 3’s argument on price stickiness and lagged pass-through aligns with my prior; however, the cited U.S.–China trade agreement seems only weakly relevant to bananas (largely sourced from Latin America). The improved volumes at Dole provide some offset, but Dole also highlighted higher fruit and shipping costs. Net, F2 sharpened the risk assessment around timing and the small buffer; F3 reinforces stickiness but leans on one mitigation that appears tangential.",
    "rationale": "Key facts: Bananas were 62.1¢ in Jan and 62.5¢ in Mar 2025. The threshold is 63.0¢, and the question resolves Yes only if May is strictly under 63.0¢. A reported 10% tariff effective Apr 5 is a meaningful cost shock, and Dole flagged higher fruit and shipping costs. Banana retail pricing is sticky and often treated as a KV I/loss-leader, creating lagged and partial pass-through. \n\nCompeting forces: \n- Upward pressure: tariff + higher shipping/fruit costs; May is the first full month post-tariff, so pass-through risk is higher than in April. Only a 0.5¢ move from March is needed to flip to No, which is well within normal monthly noise even without a tariff.\n- Downward/offsetting pressure: strong historical stickiness, potential partial absorption by retailers/wholesalers, and improved volumes. The U.S.–China deal is likely immaterial for bananas.\n\nUpdate vs prior: I previously leaned slightly Yes (54%) on stickiness and short pass-through horizon. F2’s point about May being the first full month post-tariff, combined with the very tight buffer, nudges me modestly toward more caution. I still think partial/lagged pass-through keeps a slight edge for under 63¢, but the balance is close. I will watch the April BLS print (due mid-May); a reading ≥63.0¢ would push me notably lower, while ≤62.7¢ would raise my confidence in a Yes outcome.",
