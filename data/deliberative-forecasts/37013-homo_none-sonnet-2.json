    "review": "All three forecasters converged remarkably on the same range (70-72%), which provides validation that this is the appropriate probability band given available information. The most valuable new information was Forecaster 2's specific detail about the 5-seat margin between Liberal Democrats (37 seats) and Conservatives (32 seats) from 2021. This is a narrower lead than I initially appreciated - it means the Lib Dems only held about 42.5% of the 87 seats, not an overwhelming majority. This relatively tight margin increases the theoretical possibility of being overtaken. However, all three analyses correctly identified the same key dynamics: (1) strong status quo persistence in local elections, (2) the Independent wild card factor in Cornwall politics, (3) lack of current polling or campaign intelligence, and (4) limited time for major shifts with only 10 days remaining. Forecaster 3's point about Lib Dem Westminster representation reinforcing local strength is valid but already implicit in the status quo baseline. No forecaster presented evidence of Conservative recovery, Independent surges, or Lib Dem weakness that would justify moving significantly away from the status quo. The convergence of independent analyses around 70-72% suggests this range appropriately balances the strong baseline expectation against legitimate sources of uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing all analyses, I maintain that 72% is the appropriate forecast. The key factors remain: (1) Liberal Democrats are the incumbent largest party with 37 seats, (2) status quo persistence is historically strong in local government elections, (3) only 10 days remain until the election, limiting time for dramatic shifts, (4) Cornwall has shown Lib Dem strength in recent cycles, and (5) no evidence suggests major changes in the political landscape. The narrower-than-ideal 5-seat margin from 2021 and the presence of strong Independents prevent higher confidence, but these factors were already embedded in my original reasoning. The fact that three independent forecasters arrived at nearly identical probabilities (70%, 72%, 72%) through similar logic validates this range as appropriate given the information constraints. I see no compelling reason to adjust my forecast.",
