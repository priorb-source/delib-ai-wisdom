    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~15 days until the June 24, 2025 primary; likely called within 0–7 days after RCV tabulation begins.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Cuomo is narrowly leading in public polling and, absent a late shift, slightly more likely than not to finish first and hold on through RCV transfers to become the presumptive Democratic nominee.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Mamdani consolidates the anti-Cuomo vote, benefits from second-choice transfers from other progressive candidates in RCV, and overtakes Cuomo in later rounds, or a late-breaking event (endorsement wave/negative story/turnout differential) shifts first-choice shares away from Cuomo.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cuomo tops the first-round vote by a clear margin and retains enough second-choice support from moderates/others to surpass 50% after transfers, leading credible outlets to call him the presumptive nominee within days of the primary.",
    "rationale": "Time horizon is short and the main signal we have is a poll showing Cuomo still leading while Mamdani gains. With New York City’s Democratic primary using ranked-choice voting, a polarizing frontrunner can be vulnerable if most other voters list someone else and transfers coalesce against him. However, status quo dynamics—name recognition, a likely fragmented field, and the tendency for late-deciding, lower-information voters to break toward the best-known candidate—slightly favor Cuomo. If Eric Adams is not in the race, much of the moderate/outer-borough coalition that won in 2021 is up for grabs; Cuomo is a plausible inheritor of a chunk of that vote, even with high negatives. Conversely, Mamdani’s progressive base is intense but may have a ceiling citywide unless he captures broad second-choice support beyond the left. \n\nReasons my forecast isn’t higher: Cuomo’s liabilities (scandals, high unfavorables) make him unusually exposed in RCV; a close race in late polling suggests real risk that transfers break against him. Reasons it isn’t lower: he remains the leader in available polling, retains superior name recognition, and benefits from any fragmentation among non-left candidates. \n\nWhat would move me up: fresh high-quality polls showing Cuomo expanding his lead (especially on head-to-head RCV simulations), major union/borough-machine endorsements breaking decisively for him, and early vote data suggesting strong moderate, outer-borough turnout. What would move me down: credible polling with Mamdani ahead or showing Cuomo’s negatives climbing, a consolidated progressive/left endorsement slate clearly steering transfers to Mamdani, or reporting that other non-left candidates are fading and their voters intend to rank Mamdani above Cuomo. \n\nResearch assistant provided no additional info; the main input is the referenced poll headline indicating a narrowing but intact Cuomo lead, plus structural considerations of NYC’s RCV primary.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Andrew Cuomo win the 2025 Democratic primary for New York City mayor?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Cuomo’s lead narrows as Mamdani gains ground in NYC mayoral race: poll](https://pix11.com/news/politics/cuomos-lead-narrows-as-mamdani-gains-ground-in-nyc-mayor-race/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Andrew Cuomo is the presumptive Democratic nominee for Mayor of New York City after the primary is held on June 24, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIf by the end of this tournament's scoring no presumptive nominee has been called (for example because there are not yet conclusive results from the vote counting), this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
