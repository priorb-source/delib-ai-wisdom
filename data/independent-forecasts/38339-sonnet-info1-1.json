  "information": "The 13-year gas transmission agreement between Bulgaria’s state-owned gas company Bulgargaz and Turkey’s BOTAŞ was signed in January 2023. The contract includes a 'take or pay' clause, obligating Bulgargaz to pay approximately $580,000 per day regardless of whether it uses the reserved capacity. Since July 2024, Bulgargaz has ceased payments, accumulating a debt reported to be around 4 billion leva (approximately €2 billion). Bulgarian officials have stated the company does not have the financial capacity to pay this debt, and Bulgargaz reportedly expects to incur a loss of 280 million leva in 2024.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 24 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No formal cancellation announcement is made by either party before the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the ongoing non-payment crisis and accumulated debt of approximately €2 billion, neither Bulgaria nor Turkey formally announces cancellation of the agreement. The situation continues in a state of financial distress, with negotiations, potential arbitration proceedings, or diplomatic discussions ongoing but without reaching a formal cancellation announcement. Both parties may prefer to avoid the legal and diplomatic complications of formal cancellation, instead allowing the situation to remain in limbo or pursuing resolution through other channels.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Given the severe financial crisis and Bulgargaz's bankruptcy risk, either Bulgaria unilaterally announces termination of the agreement citing financial impossibility (force majeure or material breach), or Turkey announces cancellation due to persistent non-payment since July 2024. The Bulgarian government's public request to Erdogan for cancellation leads to a formal bilateral agreement to terminate, or one party acts unilaterally before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "This forecast must weigh extreme financial distress against the typical inertia of international state agreements. Supporting higher probability: Bulgargaz has accumulated approximately €2 billion in debt and stopped payments nearly a year ago; Bulgarian PM Borissov has publicly requested cancellation; reports indicate bankruptcy risk; the 'take or pay' obligation of ~$580,000 daily is clearly unsustainable. However, several factors favor the status quo (No): With only 24 days remaining and no cancellation announcement yet reported, time is very limited; international agreements between state entities rarely get cancelled quickly even in crisis; formal cancellation requires navigating complex legal, diplomatic, and financial considerations; both parties may prefer negotiation over formal termination (Turkey wants payment, Bulgaria fears legal consequences); geopolitical sensitivities between an EU/NATO member and Turkey add complexity. The research assistant provides no evidence of an imminent announcement. Critically, we need a formal *announcement* of cancellation - even if both sides want out, achieving and announcing this within 24 days is challenging. Status quo bias is particularly strong here: the default is that nothing dramatic happens in such a short window. For my forecast to be higher (40-50%), I would need evidence of: active cancellation talks concluding imminently, official statements indicating a decision within days, or arbitration forcing immediate resolution. For it to be lower (5-10%), I would need: evidence of recent negotiated payment plans, official statements committing to continue the agreement, or legal analysis showing cancellation is prohibited. The extreme financial situation prevents going too low, but the short timeframe and lack of any announcement yet prevents going higher.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Botas Gas Agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey be cancelled before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Borissov to Erdogan: Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal](https://www.novinite.com/articles/232423/Borissov+to+Erdogan%3A+Bulgaria+Needs+Out+of+the+Botas+Gas+Deal) | [Bulgargaz on verge of bankrupty due to debts to Turkish gas company BOTAS: Turkish media](https://www.turkiyetoday.com/business/bulgargaz-on-verge-of-bankrupty-due-to-debts-to-turkish-gas-company-botas-turkish-med-3201881)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, the natural gas transmission agreement between Bulgargaz EAD and BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corp is announced by either party as being cancelled.\n\nTermination of the agreement by either side, even if denied by the other side, would still count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe 13-year gas transmission agreement between Bulgaria’s state-owned gas company Bulgargaz and Turkey’s BOTAŞ was signed in January 2023.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
