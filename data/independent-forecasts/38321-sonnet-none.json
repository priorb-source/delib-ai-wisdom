    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-3 weeks. The NATO Summit is scheduled for June 2025, and today is June 4, 2025. NATO summits typically occur mid-to-late June, so the outcome should be known very soon.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Trump attends the summit. As the sitting US President, the default expectation is that he would attend this NATO Summit. US Presidents have historically had very high attendance rates at NATO summits, which are considered essential diplomatic events for the United States' most important military alliance.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump does not attend due to an unexpected health emergency, a major domestic crisis requiring his immediate presence in the US (such as a natural disaster or security emergency), or scheduling conflict with an unforeseen critical event. Alternatively, an unprecedented diplomatic breakdown could theoretically lead to non-attendance, though this would be highly unusual.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump attends the NATO Summit in The Hague following standard presidential protocol. He participates in meetings with other NATO heads of state, engages in bilateral discussions, and represents US interests in the alliance. This follows the pattern of his previous summit attendances and fulfills the presidential responsibility to maintain alliance relationships.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors attendance. US Presidents virtually always attend NATO summits as they are core diplomatic commitments involving America's most important military alliance. Trump attended NATO summits during his first term despite his occasionally critical rhetoric about the alliance. No information suggests any reason he would not attend this summit. We are already in early June 2025, very close to when the summit should occur. If there were significant issues preventing attendance (health problems, schedule conflicts, diplomatic disputes), we would likely have heard announcements by now. The absence of such news strongly suggests attendance is proceeding as planned. Why not higher than 90%? There remains a small probability of unforeseen circumstances - sudden health issues, unexpected domestic emergencies, or other unpredictable factors that could prevent travel even at this late stage. Why not lower? Because all available information points toward attendance being the default outcome, we're very close to the event date with no contrary indicators, and presidential attendance at NATO summits is essentially standard practice barring extraordinary circumstances.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the NATO Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Netherlands to host 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_225618.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a NATO summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the NATO Summit such that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
