    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 raise critical information I completely missed: the massive $15.25B funding round in January 2025. This is the most important piece of evidence and fundamentally changes the analysis. Companies that raise enormous late-stage rounds typically don't IPO within months - the entire purpose of such funding is to delay going public. Combined with employee liquidity provisions in that round, the main drivers for an IPO are absent. Both forecasters correctly emphasize the complete absence of preparation signals (no underwriters, no confidential S-1), which is damning with only 40 days left. I over-indexed on the Data + AI Summit as a catalyst - IPOs follow SEC timelines and market windows, not conference schedules. The CEO's 'dumb to IPO this year' statement deserves much more weight than I gave it, especially with no changed rhetoric since. Their reasoning is highly convincing and my 22% was far too optimistic.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly lowering my forecast based on the January 2025 funding round information. A $15.25B raise just 4 months ago at $62B valuation removes the capital need and timing urgency that typically drives IPO decisions. The inclusion of employee liquidity provisions addresses another key IPO motivation. With zero public signals of preparation (no underwriter selection, no leaked S-1 filing) and only 40 days remaining, the probability of an announcement is very low. IPO preparations typically span many months and leave visible traces. The CEO's explicit statement that it would be 'dumb to IPO this year' remains unchallenged by any new information. Strategic investor Meta's participation suggests long-term private alignment. My earlier focus on the Data + AI Summit was misplaced - while a prominent event, conference timing doesn't drive IPO announcements, which follow regulatory and market-driven processes. I'm not going to absolute zero because 40 days provides non-trivial time and companies can occasionally surprise markets with announcements that precede longer preparation timelines. However, the convergence of recent mega-funding, explicit CEO statements, zero preparation signals, and short timeframe justifies a probability in the low single digits.",
