    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 provide thoughtful analyses of the Ivorian political climate, but their forecasts are based on a critical factual error. They both operate under the assumption that none of the named candidates have been disqualified yet. For example, Forecaster 3 states, \"As of today, there is no confirmed disqualification of the listed candidates,\" and Forecaster 2 suggests the research assistant's report implies \"none may have been disqualified yet.\" This premise is directly contradicted by the provided BBC background article from October 2024, which is titled \"Main opposition leader removed from Ivory Coast electoral list\" and specifies that this leader is former President Laurent Gbagbo, one of the five individuals named in the question. Because their entire analytical framework is built on forecasting a *new* disqualification event within the next month, their reasoning and resulting low-to-mid confidence forecasts are unconvincing. They have misidentified the question's core uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my high-confidence forecast and not updating it. My initial reasoning stands: the condition for a 'Yes' resolution has already been met. The provided BBC article explicitly confirms that Laurent Gbagbo, one of the five named candidates, was removed from the electoral list in October 2024. The resolution criteria state this question resolves 'Yes' if any of the candidates \"has been removed from the electoral list\" before July 1, 2025. Since Gbagbo's removal is an existing and ongoing status, the question is not about the probability of a *new* disqualification, but rather the probability that this *existing* disqualification will be reversed in the next 32 days. A reversal would require an extraordinary political intervention, such as a presidential pardon or a successful and rapid court appeal, which is extremely unlikely given the deep-seated political rivalries and the short timeframe. The analyses of the other forecasters, while sound in their assessment of general political dynamics, are misapplied because they start from a false premise. My 95% forecast reflects the very high probability that Gbagbo's disqualification will persist past the July 1 deadline, with the 5% accounting for the small but non-zero chance of a sudden, unexpected political development.",
