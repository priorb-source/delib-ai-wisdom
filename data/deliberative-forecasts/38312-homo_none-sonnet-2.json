    "review": "All three analyses converge remarkably on the same key factors and similar probability ranges (15%, 15%, 18%). This convergence is actually informative - it suggests we've identified the critical considerations correctly: (1) the timing constraint of being in early June with no invitation yet, (2) Canada's apparent deliberate exclusion given other countries have been invited, (3) the Canada-India diplomatic tensions since 2023, and (4) the logistical challenges versus the small possibility of rapid diplomatic shifts. Neither forecaster raised new evidence or arguments I hadn't considered. The slight variation between 15% and 18% appears to reflect minor differences in how we're quantifying the same low-probability scenario rather than substantive disagreement about the underlying situation. The convergence actually increases my confidence that 15-18% is the appropriate range for this forecast.",
    "rationale": "The convergence of all three independent analyses around 15-18% strengthens my confidence in this probability range. No new information or arguments were presented that would warrant changing my assessment. The key facts remain: it's June 3rd, India has not been invited despite other countries receiving invitations, Canada-India relations are strained, and logistical planning for G7 summits typically requires advance notice. While diplomatic situations can shift rapidly and there's technically still time for an invitation, the combination of factors makes Modi's attendance highly unlikely. The small differences between our forecasts (15% vs 18%) are within the margin of uncertainty for quantifying low-probability events and don't suggest any of us are systematically over or under-estimating. My original assessment captured the situation accurately.",
