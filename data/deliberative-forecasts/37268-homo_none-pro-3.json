    "review": "The other two forecasters presented analyses that were highly consistent with my own, both in terms of the core arguments and the final probability. We all agree that the primary factor is the strong status quo, driven by Muqtada al-Sadr's very public withdrawal and boycott, which has been consistently reaffirmed. A reversal would be costly to his credibility without a significant political victory. We also all agree that the main driver for a potential 'Yes' outcome is Sadr's well-known unpredictability and the strategic imperative to prevent his rivals from consolidating power. The other forecasters did not raise any new evidence, but their consensus at a slightly lower probability (15% vs. my 20%) is a valuable signal. Their reasoning, which places a little more weight on the inertia of Sadr's current position, is convincing and has prompted me to reconsider the precise balance of these factors.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other expert forecasts, I am lowering my probability from 20% to 15%. My core reasoning remains unchanged, but the deliberation process has led me to adjust the weighting of the key factors.\n\nThe case for a 'No' outcome remains very strong. The status quo is that Muqtada al-Sadr is boycotting the political process. He made a dramatic show of this by withdrawing all his MPs in 2022 and has repeatedly confirmed this stance since. Reversing this position without securing major concessions would be a significant political climb-down, potentially damaging his credibility with his base. With less than two months until the deadline, the window for the kind of political breakthrough that would justify such a reversal is rapidly closing.\n\nHowever, the probability of 'Yes' is not negligible due to Sadr's famously erratic and unpredictable political style. The primary motivation for him to reverse course would be to prevent his rivals in the Coordination Framework from securing another term in power and further marginalizing his movement. He could calculate that participation is the lesser of two evils.\n\nI am lowering my forecast because the consensus of the other forecasters at 15% has convinced me that my initial 20% may have slightly overweighted the 'unpredictability' factor and slightly underweighted the powerful inertia of Sadr's current public stance. The arguments for the status quo holding are extremely robust, and in the absence of any signals of a change in thinking, a lower probability is more justified. This 5-point adjustment reflects a fine-tuning of my assessment based on the persuasive and consistent reasoning of my peers.",
