    "review": "Both forecasters align with my base-rate framing and short window logic. They add two useful nuances: (1) a rough price “danger zone” (sub-$30) historically associated with removals in a price-weighted index, and (2) plausible strategic adds (Alphabet/Meta) that would imply candidates for removal (IBM, 3M, Verizon, Boeing). They also flag Boeing’s regulatory risk as a potential catalyst. None of these overturns the base case, but they sharpen the tail-risk pathways. I don’t see new concrete catalysts or credible reporting, yet Boeing’s situation and the committee’s occasional desire for representativeness provide a modest upward nudge.",
    "rationale": "The near-term window (~66 days) and the Dow’s low change frequency argue for a No. The last reshuffle (Feb 2024) makes another update soon less likely absent a forcing event. Current nominal prices of weaker names aren’t at Walgreens-like levels, and no constituent has a known, scheduled corporate action that would require a swap by July 1. However, I give slight additional weight to: (a) Boeing’s ongoing regulatory/operational risk as a potential fast-moving catalyst; (b) the possibility the committee could seek to add a major platform company for representativeness, which would necessitate dropping a current member; and (c) the resolution criterion only requires an announcement before July 1, even if effective later. These tails are still small but real. Given this, I modestly raise my estimate from 8% to 9%. I would move up on credible reporting of a pending Dow change, an announced merger/spin-off among constituents, a severe further price collapse into the sub-$30 area, or explicit S&P DJI commentary on sector representation. I would drift down as we approach mid-June with no signals.",
