  "information": "The original proposal is being reworked into a broader rule that would prohibit pushing or pulling a ball carrier anywhere on the field, not just in the specific quarterback sneak formation. This change aims to frame the issue around general football principles rather than targeting a specific team. On the other hand, the NFL's health and safety department possesses no data indicating any injuries have occurred from the 'Tush Push'. The Philadelphia Eagles, who have used the play with a high success rate, have vocally opposed the ban.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The resolution date is June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The 'Tush-Push' is currently a legal play in the NFL.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The NFL owners do not hold a vote on the matter, or a vote is held and fails to get the required 24 votes for a rule change before June 1, 2025. Consequently, the play remains legal for the upcoming season.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At an owner's meeting before June 1, 2025, a proposal to ban the 'Tush-Push' or the general act of pushing a ball carrier is formally presented and receives at least 24 votes, resulting in an official rule change.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards the status quo, where the 'Tush-Push' remains a legal play. The primary reason is the high bar for rule changes in the NFL, which requires a supermajority of 24 out of 32 owners. This is a difficult threshold to meet, especially for a controversial rule. The research report notes that a previous attempt to vote on a ban was tabled, indicating a lack of consensus. Furthermore, the league's own health and safety department has not found data linking the play to increased injuries. This significantly weakens the most compelling argument for any rule change, which is player safety. Powerful teams that have successfully utilized the play, like the Philadelphia Eagles, are actively lobbying against a ban. While the report mentions a new, broader proposal to ban all pushing of a ball carrier, which is a clever reframing, it is unclear if this has successfully swayed the necessary number of owners. Given the very short timeline until the June 1, 2025 deadline, there is limited time to whip votes and build the required coalition for such a significant change. My probability is not lower than 20% because the issue remains a prominent topic of discussion, and the Competition Committee is clearly motivated to pass a ban. The reframed proposal could potentially be more palatable to some owners, making a successful vote a non-trivial possibility. My probability is not higher because the structural barriers—the high voting threshold, the lack of a safety justification, and powerful opposition—are substantial and favor the preservation of the current rule. I would increase my forecast if influential owners publicly switched their stance to support the ban. I would decrease it if reports emerged that the proposal lacks support and will not be a primary focus of the next league meeting.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the NFL ban the \"Tush-Push\" before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nESPN: [Vote on tush push ban tabled by NFL owners for more discussion](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44490292/sources-tush-push-ban-vote-tabled-nfl-owners) | CBS Sports: [Expansive 'Tush Push' ban could have strong support at NFL's next owners meeting, per report](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/expansive-tush-push-ban-could-have-strong-support-at-nfls-next-owners-meeting-per-report/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Football League officially approves or announces a rule restricting the quarterback sneak known as the [Tush-Push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sneak#Tush_push) before June 1, 2025. If there are no reports of this occurring before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe original proposal is being reworked into a broader rule that would prohibit pushing or pulling a ball carrier anywhere on the field, not just in the specific quarterback sneak formation. This change aims to frame the issue around general football principles rather than targeting a specific team.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
