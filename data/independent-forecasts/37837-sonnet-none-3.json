    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 39 days until the outcome is known (June 2025 will conclude and data will be accessible on or after July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo outcome is that June 2025 will have a typical number of UFO sighting reports consistent with recent monthly patterns at NUFORC, which based on the threshold set in the question, appears to be in the range of 350-450 reports per month",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 has 400 or fewer reports due to typical or below-average reporting patterns. This could occur if weather conditions limit outdoor activity, if there are no major UAP-related news events to drive public interest, or if the month simply falls within the normal lower range of monthly variation in sighting reports",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 exceeds 400 reports due to favorable conditions for sightings and reporting. This could result from good summer weather encouraging outdoor activity, a major UAP-related news event generating public attention, normal seasonal increases in summer reporting, or an actual uptick in unusual aerial phenomena. June historically tends to be a high-reporting month due to increased outdoor activity and longer daylight hours",
    "rationale": "With no specific historical monthly data provided by my research assistant, I must rely on baseline reasoning. NUFORC has processed 180,000 reports over 50 years (averaging 3,600/year or 300/month historically), but reporting patterns have likely increased significantly with internet accessibility and recent heightened public interest in UAPs following government disclosures since 2017. The question's specific threshold of 400 reports suggests this is a meaningful benchmark - likely around or slightly above the median for recent months. June, as a summer month, typically sees elevated reporting due to increased outdoor activity, better weather, and longer days. These seasonal factors create favorable conditions for both genuine sightings and reports. However, the question asks specifically about exceeding 400 (not just reaching it), and status quo thinking favors outcomes that fall within normal ranges. My forecast is not higher because there's no information suggesting any extraordinary events or conditions that would drive exceptional reporting in June 2025. It's not lower because June's seasonal advantages and the general upward trend in UAP interest over recent years provide reasonable support for above-average reporting. I would update higher if data showed recent monthly averages consistently above 400, or if a major UAP-related news event occurred in May-June 2025. I would update lower if data showed recent monthly averages below 350, or if June 2025 had unusually poor weather or competing major news events",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of UFO sightings reported by the National UFO Reporting Center exceed 400 for June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts greater than 400 UFO/UAP sighting reports at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) for the month of June 2025, as displayed when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
