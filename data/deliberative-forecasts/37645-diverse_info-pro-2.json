    "review": "The other forecasters provide compelling arguments regarding the political dynamics in Serbia, but their analyses appear to be based on a different set of facts than my own. Both seem to premise their forecasts on the idea that the political crisis following the PM's resignation is ongoing in mid-May, with a decision between forming a new government and calling elections still pending. My information states that a new government was successfully formed in mid-April, resolving the constitutional trigger. This fundamental discrepancy makes it difficult to accept their high probabilities of 30% and 38%. However, their reasoning does highlight crucial factors I under-weighted. Specifically, Forecaster 2's point about Serbia's long and recent history of calling snap elections for purely tactical reasons is highly salient. Forecaster 3's analysis of the fragmented opposition, which could lower the risk for the ruling party, is also a valid consideration. While I disagree with their assessment of the immediate situation, their arguments about the underlying political culture are convincing and warrant an update to my forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast based on the arguments raised by the other forecasters regarding Serbia's political culture, while maintaining my core assumption based on the provided research. My initial forecast of 10% was anchored heavily on the fact that a new government won a confidence vote in mid-April 2025, removing the constitutional necessity for a snap election. This dramatically lowered the immediate probability. However, the other analysts rightly emphasize that Serbian politics has a strong track record of snap elections being called for strategic, rather than necessary, reasons. A fragmented opposition, as noted by Forecaster 3, could make a snap election a tempting strategic move for the ruling party to consolidate power, even with a newly formed government. The new government could have been formed merely to meet a constitutional deadline, with the intent to call an election at a politically opportune moment soon after. Therefore, I am increasing my probability to account for the significant chance of a politically-motivated election announcement. I am raising my forecast from 10% to 20%. This reflects that while the immediate crisis is resolved, the strategic incentives for a snap election, which are a recurring feature of Serbian politics, remain.",
