    "review": "Forecaster 2 leans heavily on political incentives and the claims-based resolution, arguing they’ll “find a way” to bridge a small gap. Their arithmetic (recent pace ≈ $24B/month → ~$199B by July 1) and the round-number milestone point are useful. However, 85% seems too high given timing/transition risks and the clear deceleration. Forecaster 3 emphasizes the slowdown, transition to OMB, and mounting scrutiny as real headwinds, plausibly framing the status quo as slightly short. Their 48% feels a bit low because the required run rate to add ~$25B in a month matches recent pace and the administration has shown willingness to be aggressive with claims. Both analyses sharpen the key trade-off: small remaining gap and strong incentives vs. decelerating trajectory and organizational/timing risk. Neither introduces hard evidence of a freeze, rollback, or site migration that would materially lower odds, nor firm commitments that would justify 80%+.\n",
    "rationale": "This is a claims-only criterion, and the remaining gap (~$25B) is modest relative to recent increments. Continuing the mid-March to late-May pace roughly gets them to the threshold by early July, and the symbolism of $200B around early July gives strong incentive to push it over. Leadership (Vought/OMB, Trump, Musk as advisor) favors aggressive framing, and prior criticism hasn’t halted upward revisions. Countervailing risks are nontrivial: clear deceleration, potential bureaucratic friction during the OMB/Treasury transition, and update timing (Metaculus may check on July 1 before an Independence Day–style announcement). There’s also a small chance of methodology reset or site migration that delays visible updates. Weighing these, I see the incentive-plus-small-gap story slightly dominating but not overwhelmingly so. I raise my forecast modestly to reflect the strong incentive to clear a round-number milestone and the fact that the needed cadence aligns with recent claims, while still discounting for timing/transition risks.\n",
