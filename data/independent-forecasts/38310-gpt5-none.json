    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1–4 weeks (the summit occurs in June 2025; the outcome will be known during the summit dates).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — he attends in person.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden battlefield or domestic security crisis compels Zelenskyy to remain in Ukraine; credible intelligence suggests elevated travel risk; he opts to participate only by video; or the G7 June meeting is postponed beyond June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Zelenskyy travels on a secure government aircraft with allied support and joins at least one leaders’ session at the Kananaskis venue in June, appearing in the same room as G7 heads of state.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: When invited to major summits since 2023, Zelenskyy has often chosen in-person attendance for top-tier fora, including G7, when the diplomatic payoff is high and security/logistics allow. The host (Canada) is strongly supportive of Ukraine, and a June G7 is a prime venue for aid, sanctions, and security announcements—giving strong incentives for him to appear in person. The status quo, given recent precedent (e.g., in-person at G7 2023 and 2024), points to attendance. Countervailing risks include: wartime volatility (a major Russian offensive, mass-strike campaign, or domestic emergency), last-minute security warnings, or a deliberate choice to limit long-haul travel. We are early in June, so a formal attendance confirmation may not yet be public; lack of confirmation slightly tempers confidence but does not outweigh the strong incentives and recent pattern. Why not higher: non-trivial chance of late-breaking security or operational constraints in a live war; possibility of video participation instead of travel. Why not lower: G7 is among Ukraine’s most consequential diplomatic platforms, security at Kananaskis is robust, and Zelenskyy has repeatedly undertaken similar trips. Upward updates: credible reports of confirmed in-person attendance, coordinated announcements or bilateral schedules in Canada, or travel sightings. Downward updates: reports of intensified fighting or crises in Ukraine near summit dates, security advisories affecting travel, or official indications of virtual participation. The research assistant provided no additional information; thus the estimate leans on base rates, incentives, and recent travel behavior.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Volodymyr Zelenskyy attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCalgary Herald: [Prime Minister Carney invites Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to G7 summit in Kananaskis](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/pm-mark-carney-invites-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-g7-summit-kananaskis)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
