    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - all players fall below .400 batting average by July 1",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Players who started the season hot experience normal regression to the mean as their sample size of at-bats increases. By July 1 (roughly 80-85 games into the season), even the best hitters have settled into more sustainable batting averages in the .320-.360 range, with none maintaining the .400 threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An elite hitter like Aaron Judge (referenced in the background article) is having a truly exceptional season and maintains their torrid hitting pace through early July. Despite normal statistical regression pressures, this player continues to get key hits and maintains a batting average at or above .400 on the specific date of July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The historical context is crucial here: no player has finished a season above .400 since Ted Williams in 1941, one of baseball's most enduring records. However, this question only requires maintaining .400 through July 1, not for a full season. The background article suggests Aaron Judge or another player recently had a .400 average, which is not uncommon in April or early May with smaller sample sizes. The key question is sustainability. By July 1, players will have approximately 300-400 at-bats, a substantial sample where regression to the mean becomes very powerful. Elite modern hitters typically stabilize around .300-.340. Maintaining .400 through nearly half a season would be extraordinary but not impossible. Without specific current data on who is hitting .400 right now and their underlying metrics (BABIP, contact rates, quality of contact), I must rely on base rates. Players occasionally maintain extremely high averages into June, but carrying it to July 1 is rare. The forecast is not higher because regression to the mean is extremely powerful in baseball, and .400 hitting over 2-3 months is historically very rare. The forecast is not lower because: (1) it only requires one player on one specific date, not sustained performance; (2) the article suggests someone was recently at this level; (3) with 30 teams and elite talent, outlier performances do occur. I would update higher if I knew multiple players were currently above .410 with strong underlying metrics, or lower if all players were already below .380.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if on July 1, 2025, any Major League Baseball player in the 2025 regular season has a batting average of greater than or equal to .400 according to the [ESPN baseball stats page](https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
