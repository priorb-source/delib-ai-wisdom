    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises an important point about political pressure and opportunity that I initially underweighted - the clearing field does create genuine strategic imperative for action. However, I find their 75% forecast overly optimistic given the complete absence of preparation signals. Their assumption that campaigns 'would have been in planning stages for months' is purely speculative without supporting evidence. In modern Senate races, we typically see pre-announcement indicators: staff hires, FEC activity, donor outreach, media trial balloons, or at minimum leaks to political reporters. The fact that we have zero such signals with only 10 days remaining is a very strong empirical constraint. Forecaster 3's analysis closely mirrors my own reasoning and appropriately weights the evidence vacuum. While political announcements can materialize quickly, a 75% probability requires positive evidence of preparation, not just theoretical opportunity. The clearing field argument would be more compelling if we were further from the deadline, allowing time for Stevens to assess and respond to the new landscape.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm making a modest upward adjustment from 18% to 20%. Forecaster 2's argument about political pressure and opportunity has some merit - the clearing of top-tier candidates (Whitmer, Buttigieg, McDonald, Rivet per the CNN article) does create a genuine vacuum that party leadership would want to fill quickly, and Stevens as a current representative from suburban Detroit is a plausible candidate. This increases the theoretical likelihood slightly. However, I remain anchored close to my original forecast because the empirical evidence is overwhelmingly on the side of 'no announcement.' With only 10 days remaining, the complete absence of any preparation indicators - no leaked staff hires, no FEC filings, no donor meeting reports, no media speculation about Stevens specifically, no exploratory committee formation - is highly informative. Modern Senate campaigns rarely materialize as complete surprises within such a compressed timeframe. The status quo of 'no announcement' remains the heavily favored outcome. My 20% forecast reflects: (1) acknowledgment that political circumstances can accelerate decision-making, (2) Stevens is a viable candidate who could theoretically announce quickly, (3) but the overwhelming weight of zero preparation signals with minimal time remaining.",
