    "review": "Both forecasters raised critical information I had not considered. Forecaster 3's specific milestones are particularly important: licenses already granted on April 30, public trial completed April 9, company registration March 29, and public statements targeting May 2025 launch. This is far more advanced than my initial analysis assumed. Forecaster 2's point about laser-linked satellites eliminating the need for local ground stations removes a major infrastructure delay I had implicitly factored in. However, I note it's now May 16 and the service isn't live yet despite the May target, which introduces some concern about execution risk or timeline slippage.",
    "rationale": "I significantly underestimated how far along the deployment process is. The April 30 license grants from BTRC represent actual regulatory clearance, not just political approval. Combined with the completed trial and company registration, this places Bangladesh much closer to launch than typical 'approval announcement' scenarios. The elimination of ground station requirements accelerates the timeline considerably. My initial 30% reflected generic multi-month rollout assumptions that don't apply here. However, I'm not moving all the way to Forecaster 3's 80% because: (1) we're already mid-May with no launch despite the May target, suggesting possible delays; (2) execution risks remain for payment systems, customs clearance, and final operational setup; (3) website map updates can lag actual readiness; and (4) 45 days is still a tight window with limited buffer for complications. The political investigation appears to be U.S. domestic politics unlikely to affect already-granted licenses. Balancing the strong evidence of advanced preparation against execution uncertainty and the tight timeline, I'm updating to 60%.",
