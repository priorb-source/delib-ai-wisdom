    "review": "Both forecasters add useful specifics I hadn’t surfaced: the tiny lot size (~303 lbs), very short best-by dates (Feb 21/23/25), and that distribution was confined to WA vending machines. Those features materially increase the plausibility of a May closure. I agree with their emphasis on administrative lag and the risk of a weekend cutoff. I’m less confident about the claim this is Class II; many undeclared allergen recalls (including fish) are Class I, which can lengthen verification. Even if it’s Class II, FSIS closures still often drift into the 3–6 month range. Their 62–63% feels a bit high given the page remains Active with only ~3 weeks left and the need for the status to flip before June 1 on the FSIS site.",
    "rationale": "I’m updating upward based on the added details that make rapid closure more likely: tiny volume, very perishable product with all lots expired in February, limited geographic footprint, and firm-initiated discovery with no illnesses. These factors suggest effectiveness checks and corrective actions should be straightforward and could feasibly wrap up in May. However, I’m keeping the probability below 50% because (1) as of May 8 the status is still Active with ~23 days left; (2) FSIS status changes often lag completion of field work, and bureaucratic timing can push updates into early June; and (3) if the recall is Class I (common for undeclared fish), verification requirements may be more rigorous. Net: I move from 34% to 48% (+14 pts) to reflect the stronger case for May closure while still weighting the nontrivial administrative-lag risk.",
