The event is a free conference intended for 2,000 top AI students, researchers, and recent graduates, with YC offering up to $500 for travel expenses.

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 20 days until the event begins (June 16, 7:59 AM PDT) and ~22 days until the resolution window closes (June 18, 12:00 AM PDT).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Both speak at YC AI Startup School but in separate sessions; or one appears remotely; or Musk cancels/arrives late/leaves early; or no clear evidence emerges by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "YC schedules a joint fireside chat/panel featuring both, or one joins the other’s session on stage for a brief conversation within June 16–17 PDT.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: YC’s AI Startup School (SF, June 16–17, 2025) lists both Sam Altman and Elon Musk as headline speakers. Altman and Musk have a contentious recent history (lawsuit, hostile bid). In May 2025 Altman reportedly extended an olive branch, signaling openness to collaborate; Musk has not publicly reciprocated.\n- Base rates and incentives: At large tech conferences, two high-profile rivals rarely share a stage unless it’s pre-announced as a debate or joint fireside. Without a published agenda indicating a joint session, the base case is separate talks. YC has upside in a blockbuster joint appearance but also brand/reputational risk of on-stage confrontation, especially for a student-focused event.\n- Attendance risk: Altman’s attendance is highly likely. Musk’s event attendance is notably variable; he sometimes cancels or opts for virtual appearances. The resolution requires both to be physically on the same stage.\n- Rough decomposition: P(Musk attends in person) ~ 60–70%; P(Altman attends) ~ 90–95%; conditional on both attending, P(they share a stage) ~ 20–35% absent a prior announcement. Multiplying yields ~12–22%.\n- Why not higher: No public agenda yet signaling a joint session; ongoing legal/competitive tensions; Musk’s scheduling unpredictability; YC may avoid overshadowing the program or creating controversy.\n- Why not lower: Both are billed as headliners; a public reconciliation would be massive PR for YC and both figures; the recent olive-branch narrative makes a joint chat at least plausible; there’s enough lead time for YC to announce a joint session.\n- What would move me up: Official agenda or credible reporting indicating a joint fireside/panel; public statements hinting at collaboration; YC teasing a “conversation with Sam and Elon.”\n- What would move me down: Agenda showing separate appearances; reports of either canceling or going virtual; renewed legal/PR hostilities; security/logistics constraints making a joint session impractical.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nY Combinator (YC) is launching its inaugural AI Startup School in San Francisco on June 16-17, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
