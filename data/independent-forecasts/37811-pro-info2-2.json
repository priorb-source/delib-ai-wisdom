  "information": "The Trump administration has implemented significant budget and staff cuts at NOAA. According to reports, hundreds of scientists and climate experts have been laid off, sparking concern over the future of climate research and environmental policy. These actions are seen by some as aligning with the 'Project 2025' plan promoted by the Heritage Foundation, which proposes dismantling the agency. Additionally, some of NOAA's regional climate centers have been shut down, and all contributors to the National Climate Assessment have been fired.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, the website is currently online and government websites have high persistence and uptime. The default outcome is that it remains online.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A politically-motivated decision by the Trump administration, likely as part of the 'Project 2025' agenda, results in a direct and swift order to take Climate.gov offline before the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite political and budgetary pressures on NOAA, bureaucratic inertia, technical implementation timelines, or a focus on other higher-priority policy actions prevents the website from being taken down before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. Government websites are generally persistent, and taking one down requires a deliberate, successful action. The website Climate.gov is currently online and functional. However, the information provided by my research assistant presents a significant and credible threat to the website's existence. The report of budget cuts, layoffs of scientists, and the closure of climate centers at NOAA, explicitly linked to the 'Project 2025' plan to dismantle the agency, indicates strong political will to curtail government climate activities. Taking down a public-facing website like Climate.gov would be a symbolic and relatively straightforward action in line with this agenda. The primary factor preventing a lower probability is the extremely short timeline of approximately six weeks until the resolution date. Even with strong political will, bureaucratic and technical processes can introduce delays. My forecast is not higher (e.g., 95%) because the reported actions against NOAA are not hypothetical; they are concrete and severe, making the 'No' scenario plausible even in a short timeframe. My forecast is not lower (e.g., 50%) because inertia is a powerful force, and there is no specific intelligence that Climate.gov is an immediate target for takedown. I would update my forecast lower (towards No) if there were official statements targeting government climate websites or if other similar websites began to go offline. I would update higher (towards Yes) if reports emerged of internal resistance to these actions or if the administration's focus was credibly diverted to other matters.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA's Climate.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNational Security Archive: [Disappearing Data: Trump Administration Removing Climate Information from Government Websites](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/climate-change-transparency-project-foia/2025-02-06/disappearing-data-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Climate.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Trump administration has implemented significant budget and staff cuts at NOAA. According to reports, hundreds of scientists and climate experts have been laid off, sparking concern over the future of climate research and environmental policy. These actions are seen by some as aligning with the 'Project 2025' plan promoted by the Heritage Foundation, which proposes dismantling the agency. Additionally, some of NOAA's regional climate centers have been shut down, and all contributors to the National Climate Assessment have been fired.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
