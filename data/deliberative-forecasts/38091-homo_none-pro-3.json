    "review": "The other two forecasters built their analyses on the same core evidence as I did: the recent and consistent rate of new signatories, averaging about one per month. We are in strong agreement on the primary driver of the forecast. I found two points particularly useful. Forecaster 2's reframing of the status quo as a 'dynamic process of expansion' rather than a static state is a compelling argument against a simple status quo bias. Forecaster 3's longer-term data, showing an average rate of 0.82 signatories per month over the last 17 months, provides valuable context and confirms that the recent momentum is not an anomaly but an acceleration of a sustained trend. Both of these points slightly strengthen the case for a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 60% was based on the clear trend of one new signatory per month in April and May, balanced against the inherent uncertainty of diplomatic timing. The analyses from the other forecasters have reinforced my confidence in this trend. The longer-term data provided by Forecaster 3 demonstrates that the recent pace is part of a sustained, accelerating pattern, not a brief spike. Furthermore, Forecaster 2's argument about the status quo being one of 'dynamic expansion' effectively counters my initial concern about a no-change bias. While the risk of a signing being delayed into July remains the primary reason for uncertainty, the consolidated evidence suggests the momentum is robust. The collective reasoning convinces me to slightly increase my forecast to better reflect the strength of this ongoing trend. I am therefore making a small upward adjustment of two percentage points.",
