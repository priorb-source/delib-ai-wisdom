    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling arguments that strengthen the case for a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 2's analysis is particularly persuasive by introducing a critical new piece of information: the specific court hearing date of June 18. This transforms the situation from a general question of pressure and reputational risk into one with a distinct, near-term legal event that could directly prevent the performance through remand or restrictive bail conditions. Forecaster 3 adds another powerful argument by highlighting the tangible risk to Glastonbury's operating license, a lever that authorities could use and which the festival organizers could not easily ignore. These points are more concrete and compelling than my initial reasoning, which focused more on general risk assessment.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downwards based on the structured deliberation. My initial 35% forecast correctly identified the exceptional gravity of a Terrorism Act charge but underestimated the specific mechanisms through which a cancellation would likely occur. The other forecasters' introduction of the June 18th court date and the risk to the festival's operating license provides these clear mechanisms. The probability of a court allowing a defendant in a terrorism case to perform at a major public festival just one week after their hearing seems very low; restrictive bail conditions are a standard and likely outcome. Furthermore, the risk of losing their license would make it almost impossible for the Glastonbury organizers to defy a formal security recommendation from the police. These factors significantly outweigh the status quo of the band remaining on the lineup and the festival's history of defiance. Therefore, I am revising my forecast from 35% down to 25%, aligning with the reasoning that the legal and licensing risks now present almost insurmountable obstacles to the performance.",
