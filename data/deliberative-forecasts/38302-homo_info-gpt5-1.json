    "review": "Both forecasters add useful, concrete signals I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: May PMIs (manu 49.5, non-manu 50.3), a mid-May RRR cut signaling policymakers still see weak demand, and the point that pork prices likely remained lower YoY due to high inventories. Forecaster 3’s note that Brent was modestly higher YoY but domestic energy likely still negative YoY is also relevant, implying energy remains a small drag. I find their framing credible: with core/services modestly positive (boosted by the May Day holiday) but food and energy still likely negative YoY, the headline sits near zero with a slight tilt below. Their arguments mostly reinforce the continuation case; the main counterweight remains services seasonality around the holiday, which could tip it to zero/+0.1%. Overall, their reasoning nudges me upward from my prior.",
    "rationale": "My initial 42% leaned slightly toward a positive/zero print due to services seasonality and improving odds that food drags might ease. The additional evidence—weak PMIs, policy easing that won’t affect May, and indications that pork and energy likely remained negative YoY—strengthens the case that headline stays just below zero. The outcome is still a near coin flip because the May Day travel impulse could lift services enough to offset part of the goods drag, and recent prints are very close to zero. But given the added signals of ongoing demand softness and persistent drags in food and energy, I update toward a modestly >50% chance of another negative.",
