    "review": "Both other forecasters arrived at a consensus of 72%, which is substantially lower than my initial 95%. Their primary argument, which I find compelling, is that the inherent risks and unpredictability of leading a country at war create a significant background probability of last-minute cancellations. They correctly note that there are past instances where President Zelenskyy has had to change travel plans or attend virtually due to urgent developments. This is a valid general risk factor that I had not weighted heavily enough; my initial analysis was focused almost exclusively on the specific, positive evidence for this particular trip.Forecaster 3 also provided useful context on Zelenskyy's concurrent travel schedule, which I agree makes the trip logistically feasible and reinforces the 'Yes' case, but their overall risk assessment still brought them to a lower probability.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am updating my forecast downward, though not to their level of 72%. The other forecasters correctly identified a weakness in my initial reasoning: I did not sufficiently account for the general 'base rate' of risk associated with any international travel by a wartime head of state. Their arguments about sudden battlefield escalations, security threats, or domestic crises leading to past cancellations are valid and warrant a higher probability for a 'No' outcome than I originally estimated.However, I believe a 72% forecast significantly underweights the power of the most recent and specific evidence. President Zelenskyy’s public, unequivocal statement on May 27, 2025 — 'I will be' — is an exceptionally strong signal. A public commitment of this nature is not made lightly and carries reputational costs if reversed for anything less than a severe, acute crisis. This, combined with Canada's advanced security preparations which include a no-fly-zone, indicates a very high degree of confidence from both parties just two weeks out.While the general risks are real, the specific evidence for this event pushes the probability much higher than 72%. I am therefore adjusting my forecast from 95% down to 90%. This change reflects a doubling of my estimated risk of cancellation (from 5% to 10%) based on the other forecasters' reasoning, while still maintaining that the specific commitments from both Ukraine and Canada make attendance the overwhelmingly likely outcome.",
