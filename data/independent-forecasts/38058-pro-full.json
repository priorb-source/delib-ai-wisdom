  "information": "U.S. President Donald Trump has postponed the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, moving the deadline from June 1 to July 9, 2025. The delay came after a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who stated more time was needed for negotiations. U.S. officials have expressed frustration with the EU's cautious approach and lack of specific proposals in the trade talks. A key U.S. demand for a new trade agreement is a commitment from the EU to impose tariffs on Chinese industrial goods, which has not yet been agreed to.\n\nDomestically, U.S. tariff policy has drawn media commentary. The New York Post's editorial board warned of 'tariff burnout' among President Trump's supporters due to inconsistent implementation. The Wall Street Journal's editorial board has also criticized the tariffs, suggesting they would primarily benefit lobbyists and could be used by politicians to leverage campaign contributions. Internationally, Vietnam is reportedly fast-tracking a $1.5 billion Trump golf resort, a move linked to efforts to secure a new trade agreement with the U.S. and avoid potential tariffs as a 90-day pause on trade levies approaches its end.\n\nThe discussions around U.S. tariff policy have had observable economic effects. President Trump's announcement to delay the EU tariffs led to a positive shift in market sentiment and a surge in U.S. stock futures. In early April 2025, after the signing of an executive order for a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff', there were reports of U.S. consumers stockpiling goods in anticipation of price increases. According to an estimate by the Tax Foundation, the proposed tariffs could cost U.S. households an additional $830 in 2025, reduce the nation's GDP by 0.4%, and result in the loss of 350,000 jobs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks, until June 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Given that tariffs are a central and ongoing economic and political issue for the current administration, the baseline expectation is that the topic will continue to receive prominent, daily media coverage, thus appearing on the front page of at least one of the specified newspapers each day.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing trade negotiations with the European Union remain tense and produce daily developments, or President Trump makes frequent public statements on the topic, ensuring that the word 'tariff' appears on the front page of either the NYT or WSJ every single day until July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On at least one day within the resolution window, likely a weekend or a day dominated by a different major breaking news event (e.g., a natural disaster, international crisis, or major domestic scandal), the tariff story is temporarily crowded out and fails to appear on the front page of both newspapers.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the tension between the high prominence of the tariff story and the low threshold for a 'Yes' resolution. The research indicates that tariffs are a top-tier news item due to the ongoing US-EU negotiations with a new deadline of July 9, 2025. This ensures the topic will remain highly relevant throughout the resolution period. The Wall Street Journal and New York Times are the papers of record for business and politics, making them very likely to cover this topic. However, the question resolves as 'No' only if the word 'tariff' appears on at least one of the two front pages *every single day* for approximately 35 consecutive days. This is a very high bar. News cycles are volatile, and it is common for even major stories to be temporarily displaced by other significant breaking news. The resolution needs only one such day for a 'Yes' outcome. The fact that the EU tariff deadline was pushed to July 9, after the resolution period, may also create lulls in front-page coverage as the immediate deadline pressure is removed. My probability is not higher because the story's prominence and the president's focus on it create a strong chance of daily mentions, especially given the broad inclusion criteria (e.g., the WSJ's 'What's News' section). It is not lower because the statistical likelihood of *any* single topic achieving perfect, unbroken daily front-page presence across two outlets for over a month is very small. I would lower my forecast if a new, dramatic tariff-related event with a deadline inside June were to occur. I would raise it if the US-EU talks were officially paused until July.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. Before July, will we see tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on any single day after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, the words \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\" appear on neither the digital version of the front page of The New York Times nor the Wall Street Journal.

Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\n* Grammar or spelling will not prevent a **No** resolution.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, including \"Pages A2-A3 and Corrections\", \"What's News: Business & Finance\" not just the initial section at the top.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
