  "information": "The 2026 Florida gubernatorial race involves several candidates. For the Republican nomination, Congressman Byron Donalds has launched his campaign and received an endorsement from former President Trump. Other potential Republican candidates include Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis, former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, and Lt. Governor Jeanette Nuñez. On the Democratic side, former U.S. Representative David Jolly has announced his candidacy. State senator Jason Pizzo also announced he will run as an independent. Florida's primary election is scheduled for August 18, 2026, with the general election on November 3, 2026.\n\nAs of early June 2025, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has publicly stated he is considering a run for governor. A poll conducted by The James Madison Institute in May 2025 showed Suarez with 5% support in the Republican primary field. In local politics, the Miami City Commission was set to vote on a proposal to move the city's November election to 2026, which would extend the terms of current commissioners and Mayor Suarez by one year.\n\nHistorically, in the last two open Florida gubernatorial cycles (2018 and 2022), major candidates typically announced their campaigns 12 to 18 months before the primary election. For the 2026 cycle, some contenders, such as Republican Byron Donalds and Democrat David Jolly, had already announced their candidacies by early June 2025. Reports note that as of early June, there have been no leaks of a launch date, no exploratory committee paperwork filed by Suarez, and no scheduled kickoff events for a gubernatorial campaign.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement - Suarez continues to consider a run but does not formally announce candidacy before the July 1 deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Suarez remains in the exploratory phase through June, citing the need to resolve the Miami election timing issue and assess fundraising viability. He either announces after July 1st or decides not to run at all given his low polling (5%) and the crowded Republican field with Trump-endorsed Byron Donalds already leading.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Suarez concludes his deliberations within the next 3-4 weeks and makes a formal announcement in late June. This could be triggered by securing major donor commitments, receiving encouragement from Florida Republican establishment concerned about the current field, or deciding that waiting longer would put him at too much of a disadvantage against already-announced candidates.",
    "rationale": "The key factors pointing toward a lower probability: (1) Complete absence of concrete preparation signals - no exploratory committee paperwork, no leaked launch dates, no scheduled kickoff events as of early June 2025; (2) Only 26 days remaining, which while technically sufficient, leaves little time for what is typically a planned rollout; (3) The pending Miami City Commission vote on extending terms suggests Suarez may be waiting to resolve local political issues first; (4) His low 5% polling support may discourage entry. Factors supporting some probability: (1) We are within the historical 12-18 month pre-primary window when major candidates typically announce; (2) Other candidates have already jumped in, creating pressure to decide; (3) 26 days is enough time for an announcement if a decision is made; (4) He has publicly stated he is considering the race. The status quo strongly favors no announcement given the complete lack of visible preparation. If Suarez were seriously planning to announce before July 1st, we would typically expect to see some activity by now. However, politicians can move quickly when motivated, so I cannot rule it out entirely. For me to revise upward, I would need evidence of: exploratory committee formation, scheduled events, staff hiring, or credible media reports of an imminent announcement. For me to revise downward further, I would need Suarez to explicitly rule out a run or announce he is waiting until later in 2025.",
