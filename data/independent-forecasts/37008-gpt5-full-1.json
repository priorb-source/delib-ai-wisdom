  "information": "A state of emergency was declared in Samoa on March 31, 2025, due to a severe energy crisis. The declaration was scheduled to be in effect for 30 days, from April 1, 2025, through April 29, 2025.\n\nAccording to reports from Samoa NewsHub and the Samoa Observer, temporary generators were expected to be operational by the end of April, coinciding with the scheduled end of the state of emergency. However, the permanent solution to the power crisis is not anticipated to be in place until August 2025.\n\nAs of April 21, 2025, the Samoan government had not announced any plans to extend the state of emergency. The National Emergency Operation Centre's update on April 15 confirmed that emergency orders were valid until April 29. The crisis has had a significant economic impact, estimated at a 16% hit to the country's GDP.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current emergency proclamation expires at 11:59 pm on April 29 and is not extended or reissued. Temporary generators come online on schedule (around late April), stabilizing supply enough that the government allows emergency powers to lapse.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before April 29, the government extends the existing emergency or issues a fresh proclamation covering April 30 (e.g., due to delays commissioning temporary generators, continuing rolling blackouts, fuel/logistics constraints requiring emergency powers, or an unrelated hazard such as a severe weather or health emergency).",
    "rationale": "- What we know: Samoa declared a state of emergency for the energy crisis on March 31, scheduled for 30 days through April 29. As of April 21, no extension has been announced; NEOC said orders are valid until April 29. Temporary generators were expected by late April; permanent fixes are not due until August. The crisis has large economic impacts.\n- Status quo baseline: If nothing changes, the proclamation lapses on April 29, so there would be no state of emergency on April 30. I place extra weight on this default because governments often let time-limited emergencies expire when a short-term workaround is in sight.\n- Reasons for Yes risk: (1) Schedule risk: late-April commissioning could slip a few days; in a small island system, shipping/installation delays are common. (2) Adequacy risk: even if installed, temporary capacity or fuel logistics may be insufficient initially, prompting continued rationing and a legal need for emergency powers. (3) Policy risk: the government may prefer to keep emergency authorities briefly to expedite procurement and enforce conservation while testing the new setup. (4) Low but nonzero chance of an unrelated emergency (e.g., severe weather or health) coinciding with April 30.\n- Reasons against Yes: (1) Clear signaling so far—orders noted as valid only until April 29; no public plan to extend as of April 21. (2) Political incentive to normalize once a stopgap is in place. (3) The expected timing of temporary generators aligns with the SoE’s scheduled end, reducing the need for extension.\n- Why not higher: Lack of extension signals to date and plausible on-time commissioning keep the default at No. If the government intended a straightforward continuation, indications often surface within the final week. \n- Why not lower: The system remains fragile, and small slippages could easily warrant a short extension; Samoa has precedent of rolling extensions in past emergencies (e.g., COVID), so the mechanism and tolerance for extensions exist.\n- What would move me up: Reports of generator delays or failures, worsening outages, fuel shortages, or official hints from the PM/NEOC about continuing restrictions or procurement under emergency powers. Any new hazard declaration. \n- What would move me down: Confirmation that temporary generators are installed/commissioned ahead of April 29, official statements that the emergency will lapse, or clear improvement in grid stability and lifting of rationing measures.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count. (Note that when it was declared, it was scheduled to be in effect through April 29, 2025.)\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA state of emergency was declared in Samoa on March 31, 2025, due to a severe energy crisis.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
