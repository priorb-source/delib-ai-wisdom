  "information": "Following his election win on April 28, 2025, Prime Minister Mark Carney presented a new, smaller cabinet of 29 ministers, down from 39 in the previous administration. Key figures such as François-Philippe Champagne (Finance) and Dominic LeBlanc (US Trade) were retained. Carney's government announced it would not table a full federal budget before the summer, opting for a fall economic statement instead. The new administration's immediate promises include a tax cut and the elimination of all inter-provincial trade barriers by July 1. Carney signed a symbolic decree to lower the first taxable income bracket from 15% to 14%, a measure requiring parliamentary approval. The Liberal party's platform includes additional spending that projects the national deficit for 2025-26 to be $62.3 billion Canadian dollars, an increase from the $42.2 billion forecast in December.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Mark Carney likely has higher approval than Donald Trump due to honeymoon effect",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump's approval rating remains steady in the mid-40s while Carney's honeymoon period ends abruptly due to concerns about the projected $62.3 billion deficit or other early controversies. Alternatively, Trump experiences an approval bump from significant policy wins or international successes that boost his ratings above typical levels.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Carney maintains his post-election honeymoon period through July 1st, with Canadians responding positively to his new cabinet, tax cut promise, and pledge to eliminate inter-provincial trade barriers. Meanwhile, Trump's approval remains at his historically typical levels in the low-to-mid 40s, which has consistently been below average for US presidents.",
    "rationale": "Mark Carney won a national election on April 28, 2025, meaning he'll have been Prime Minister for just over two months by July 1st. This places him squarely in the typical 'honeymoon period' for new leaders, which historically lasts 3-6 months and features elevated approval ratings. His election victory itself demonstrates significant public support. The research indicates he's taken popular symbolic actions like the tax cut decree and cabinet streamlining. Donald Trump's approval ratings during his first presidency typically ranged from 38-49%, often hovering around 40-43% - historically low compared to other modern presidents. His polarizing style makes dramatic approval increases unlikely, though his second term could see some variation. The Morning Consult methodology using 7-day rolling averages should capture relatively current sentiment for both leaders by July 1st. My forecast is not higher because: (1) we lack current baseline data for either leader; (2) Carney's platform includes a significant deficit increase which could dampen enthusiasm; (3) Trump could experience an approval bump; (4) honeymoon effects, while common, aren't guaranteed. My forecast is not lower because: (1) the honeymoon effect is well-documented and robust; (2) Trump's approval patterns are historically predictable and typically low; (3) Carney just won an election, indicating strong support; (4) early July is very soon, limiting time for Carney's approval to decline significantly. I would update higher if polls showed Carney starting with very high approval (60%+) and Trump remaining in the low 40s. I would update lower if early Canadian polling showed weak approval for Carney's government or if Trump demonstrated sustained approval in the high 40s.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mark Carney has a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing his election win on April 28, 2025, Prime Minister Mark Carney presented a new, smaller cabinet of 29 ministers, down from 39 in the previous administration.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
