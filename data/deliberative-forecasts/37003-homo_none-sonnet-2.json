    "review": "All three forecasters converged on remarkably similar analyses, ranging from 70-75%, which increases my confidence that we've identified the key factors correctly. The unanimous recognition of SPÖ's 80-year dominance in Vienna as the overwhelming baseline is appropriate. Forecaster 2 made an excellent point about institutional 'patronage networks built over decades' that I hadn't explicitly articulated - this is a significant structural advantage beyond just historical voting patterns. Forecaster 3's mention of 'long-term incumbency fatigue' is a valid counterweight. Both forecasters also referenced broader European trends of social democratic parties losing traditional strongholds to populist right-wing parties, which contextualizes national FPÖ gains within a larger pattern. The tight clustering of our forecasts (70-75%) suggests strong agreement on how to weight the competing factors. I note that all three of us identified essentially identical update conditions: we'd move higher with polls showing 10+ point SPÖ leads, and lower with evidence of a tight race or major SPÖ problems.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my initial 70% forecast may have been slightly too cautious. The convergence of all three analyses around 70-75% suggests this is the appropriate range, and the institutional advantages highlighted by the other forecasters - particularly the patronage networks and unprecedented 80-year control - are genuinely substantial. While I maintain concern about national FPÖ momentum and potential incumbency fatigue, Vienna's distinct political culture and demographics provide stronger insulation from national trends than I initially weighted. The reference to March 2025 polling suggests active monitoring but not necessarily a crisis for the SPÖ. Without access to those specific numbers, the historical baseline deserves heavy weight. I'm updating upward modestly to align with Forecaster 3's balanced assessment, which appropriately weighs both the overwhelming status quo advantage and the genuine uncertainties from broader political trends.",
