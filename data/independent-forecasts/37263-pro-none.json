    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Turks and Caicos government, influenced by the local taxi industry and concerned about regulation, does not approve Uber's entry into the market. The existing transportation model remains in place, and Uber does not officially launch its services by the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a bid to modernize its tourism offerings and provide more choice for visitors, the Turks and Caicos government fast-tracks regulatory approval for Uber. The company, seeing a lucrative market, launches its service just in time for the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted on the status quo. Uber is not currently available in the Turks and Caicos Islands, and establishing operations in a new country, particularly a small island nation with an established taxi industry, is a complex process. The timeframe of approximately two months is very short for the necessary regulatory approvals, driver recruitment, and logistical setup. The provided article indicates that local stakeholders are focused on reinforcing the existing licensed taxi system and cracking down on 'illegal' operators, suggesting a regulatory environment that is likely unreceptive or hostile to a disruptive service like Uber. There is no public information to suggest that Uber is currently in negotiations or planning a launch in this market. While a surprise agreement is not impossible, it is highly improbable given the lack of evidence and the significant logistical and political barriers. My probability is not lower than 5% to account for the small chance of a sudden policy shift by the government or a pre-existing, non-public agreement being announced. It is not higher because the strong opposition from entrenched local taxi unions, as is common in many tourism-dependent island nations, combined with the short timeline, presents a formidable obstacle. I would increase my forecast upon seeing credible reports of negotiations between Uber and the TCI government or official announcements of a planned launch. Conversely, I would lower it if TCI officials make statements reaffirming the exclusivity of the current taxi model.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Uber be available in the Turks and Caicos Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tourism Stakeholders Warned About Encouraging Use of Illegal Taxis](https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/tourism-stakeholders-warned-about-encouraging-use-of-illegal-taxis/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Uber is available in Turks and Caicos as shown on the [Uber website](https://www.uber.com/us/en/search-results/?query=TURKS+AND+CAICOS) or according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
