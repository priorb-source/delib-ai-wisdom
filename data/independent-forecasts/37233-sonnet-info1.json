  "information": "In a January 2025 address to the diplomatic corps, President Alassane Ouattara stated he was in 'perfect health and ready to continue serving my country', but clarified that he had 'not yet made a decision' regarding a candidacy in the October 2025 presidential election. He noted that his party, the RHDP, has at least a dozen potential candidates. Previously, in 2020, Ouattara had announced his intention to step down but reversed this decision to run for a third term after the sudden death of his designated successor.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "33 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ouattara has not declared his candidacy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ouattara continues deliberating and delays his decision beyond June 1, 2025, possibly waiting until closer to the October election to maintain strategic flexibility and assess the political landscape. He may be waiting to see how other candidates from his party perform or to gauge public sentiment before committing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ouattara decides to run for re-election and makes a formal declaration in the next 33 days. Given his January comments about being 'ready to continue serving' and his 2020 precedent of reversing a retirement decision, he announces his candidacy in May, energizing his RHDP party base ahead of the October election.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome - as of January 2025, Ouattara explicitly stated he had 'not yet made a decision' about running. With only 33 days until the June 1 deadline, the base rate suggests he remains undecided. However, several factors create upward pressure on the probability: (1) His January language ('perfect health and ready to continue serving') signals openness to running, (2) He has precedent for reversing retirement decisions (2020), and (3) 33 days provides meaningful time for such announcements. Against this, there's no apparent urgency to declare by June 1 specifically - the October election is still 5+ months away, giving ample time for a declaration in June, July, or August. His party has 'at least a dozen potential candidates,' suggesting he may wait to assess alternatives. Politicians often delay major announcements for strategic reasons, and Ouattara has shown comfort with maintaining ambiguity. The specific June 1 cutoff is arbitrary from a campaign perspective, making it more likely he waits beyond this date even if he ultimately runs. My forecast would increase substantially if credible reports emerged of imminent announcements or electoral law requirements for early registration. It would decrease if he made statements leaning away from candidacy or if strong alternative candidates gained momentum within RHDP. The combination of status quo bias, short timeframe, and lack of deadline pressure suggests roughly 30% probability.",
