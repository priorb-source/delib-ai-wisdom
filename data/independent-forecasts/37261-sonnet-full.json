  "information": "The '50501' movement, a decentralized organization originating from a Reddit forum, planned nationwide protests on May 1, 2025, coinciding with International Workers' Day. The protests were organized to oppose the Trump administration's policies on immigration and labor. The movement's website listed over 1,000 events across all 50 states, with major demonstrations expected in Washington D.C., Chicago, Denver, Seattle, and Los Angeles. Organizations supporting the protests included the Political Revolution PAC and the Service Employees International Union. News reports following the event stated that over 1,100 protests took place under the '50501' banner across the U.S. and worldwide.\n\nOn April 5, 2025, demonstrations under the \"Hands Off!\" campaign occurred across all 50 U.S. states and in several international cities. A coalition of over 150 groups, including Indivisible and MoveOn, organized the events in response to administration policies such as federal layoffs, rising tariffs, and civil rights rollbacks. Participation estimates varied: one report cited over 1,400 events with nearly 600,000 attendees, while another stated over 600,000 people participated in more than 1,200 rallies. Solidarity protests were also held in cities like Berlin, London, and Paris.\n\nData from the Crowd Counting Consortium from early 2025 showed a notable trend in protest activity. The consortium recorded 2,085 protests nationwide in February 2025, more than double the 937 recorded in February 2017. However, the data also indicated that the average size of these events had decreased to an estimated 60-88 participants per protest. In separate protest movements, over 300 actions were reported on university campuses related to the conflict in Israel.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - unless the Global Protest Tracker has already or will soon report one of the recent large protests with 10,000+ participants",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recent protests on April 5 and May 1, despite being widespread, did not have individual events reaching 10,000 participants at a single location. The Global Protest Tracker either doesn't cover these events or reports them with participant counts below 10,000. No additional large-scale protests occur in the remaining two months before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the 'major demonstrations' from the May 1 '50501' movement (in Washington D.C., Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, or Denver) or the April 5 'Hands Off!' campaign events had 10,000+ participants at a single location, and the Global Protest Tracker captures and reports this. Alternatively, another large protest occurs between now and July 1 that reaches this threshold.",
    "rationale": "The key evidence suggests substantial protest activity has already occurred in the relevant timeframe. The May 1 '50501' protests included explicit 'major demonstrations' in multiple large cities, and the April 5 'Hands Off!' campaign saw nearly 600,000 participants across 1,200-1,400 events. However, the critical question is whether any single event reached 10,000 participants. The Crowd Counting Consortium data showing average protest sizes of only 60-88 participants in early 2025 is concerning and suggests that even with widespread activity, individual events may be smaller. Calculating rough averages: 600,000 participants across 1,200-1,400 events yields 429-500 average participants per event. For a single event to have 10,000+ participants would require it to be roughly 20x the average size. However, in major metropolitan areas like Washington D.C., Los Angeles, or Chicago, it's plausible that flagship protests could draw substantially larger crowds than the national average. The multi-city nature of the campaigns might dilute attendance at any single location, but the explicit labeling of certain demonstrations as 'major' suggests organizers expected significant turnout in key cities. With approximately 2 months remaining, additional protest opportunities exist, though the status quo of recent activity already occurring is most relevant. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the average protest size data suggests smaller crowds, (2) uncertainty whether the Global Protest Tracker has or will capture these events with accurate 10,000+ counts, and (3) the distributed nature of events may prevent any single location from reaching the threshold. My forecast is not lower because: (1) explicit mention of 'major demonstrations' in large cities, (2) substantial overall participation numbers, (3) two months remain for additional events, and (4) historical precedent shows that major U.S. protests can draw large crowds in flagship cities. I would update higher if: evidence emerges that the Global Protest Tracker has already logged a 10,000+ event, or reports of specific event attendance showing 10,000+ at single locations. I would update lower if: detailed attendance breakdowns show all events were below 10,000, or if the Global Protest Tracker's methodology appears unlikely to capture or verify large U.S. protests.",
