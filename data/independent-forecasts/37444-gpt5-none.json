    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 55 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Nord Stream 2 AG remains on OFAC’s SDN list when checked on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration continues to debate but opts to avoid a politically costly delisting without a broader Russia-related deal. OFAC keeps Nord Stream 2 AG on the SDN List, perhaps issuing or adjusting licenses for narrow activities but not removing the listing. The pipeline’s non-operational status reduces any urgency to act, and congressional pushback plus Ukraine-war optics keep the status quo in place through July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "As part of a broader diplomatic or sanctions-recalibration package, the administration directs OFAC to delist Nord Stream 2 AG under EO 14024/PEESA authorities, framing it as a technical correction or confidence-building step. OFAC publishes a delisting notice in June, and the entity no longer appears in the Sanctions List Search by July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Nord Stream 2 AG has been on the SDN List since 2022. Delistings of high-profile Russia targets are uncommon absent clear policy shifts, and the pipeline is damaged/non-operational, lowering practical pressure to delist. With only ~8 weeks left, the status quo strongly favors “No.”\nSignal: The April 23 Politico report that the White House is debating lifting some sanctions, including Nord Stream 2, raises the probability above a pure inertia prior. It implies an internal pathway exists and the logistics (OFAC updates occur regularly) are feasible within the window if a decision is made.\nCountervailing factors: Political optics around Russia remain difficult. Delisting Nord Stream 2 AG is symbolically charged and would likely trigger bipartisan criticism unless packaged within a broader agreement (e.g., prisoner exchanges, ceasefire steps, or G7-aligned recalibration). Congress cannot easily block an OFAC delisting quickly, but the anticipated backlash is a deterrent. Germany and EU energy security no longer hinge on Nord Stream 2, so external pressure to act fast is muted.\nWhy not higher: No concrete follow-up since the Politico leak, the short timeline, and the high-profile nature of the target all argue that in the absence of a visible deal, default is that it stays listed. A general license or waiver without delisting would not satisfy the resolution criteria.\nWhy not lower: The explicit White House debate suggests a real (if minority) chance. If the administration is preparing a June sanctions package, delisting could be included, and OFAC can implement quickly.\nUpdates that would move me up: Credible reporting of a forthcoming June sanctions package with explicit reference to delistings; official readouts hinting at Russia-related confidence-building steps; public German/European support; a US-Russia diplomatic milestone tied to sanctions relief. Updates that would move me down: Public statements ruling out relief on Nord Stream 2; new Russian escalation; congressional moves to harden sanctions; OFAC actions reinforcing current designations without signs of a broader recalibration.\nResearch assistant summary: No additional information beyond the Politico report, which I treat as the main positive signal but insufficient to outweigh the strong status-quo bias within the short timeframe.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
