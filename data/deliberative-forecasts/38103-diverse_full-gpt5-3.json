    "review": "- Both forecasters convincingly emphasize status quo inertia, strong political backing (Premier Eby, Minister Dix), and that this move is part of a broader, coordinated policy response (e.g., liquor actions), which supports persistence through July.\n- Forecaster 2’s 98% feels overconfident given the resolution hinges on explicit mention on the specific BC Hydro page. Even if policy persists, BC Hydro could revise the page to brand-neutral wording or relocate the detail, leading to a No resolution despite continued exclusion.\n- Forecaster 3’s 85% aligns more closely with my prior view and implicitly leaves room for web-copy or communications drift.\n- Neither added new facts beyond the RA, but their emphasis on cross-sector alignment and short timeline strengthens the case that explicit language is likely to remain through early July, especially during a grandfathering window when clarity is important.",
    "rationale": "I continue to see the dominant forces favoring a Yes outcome: the exclusion is recent (March 12), publicly defended, and embedded in a broader Buy-Canadian posture. With ~1 month to go, a policy reversal is unlikely. Importantly for this question, agencies often keep explicit, consumer-facing clarifications during transition/grandfathering periods, which supports continued explicit mention of Tesla on the page.\n\nKey tail risks remain: (1) BC Hydro could sanitize the page to brand-neutral language or move specifics into a different document/page, which would resolve No under the strict criterion; (2) unexpected, rapid trade détente triggering a comms change; (3) site reorganization. These are possible but not probable on the short timeline.\n\nGiven the additional weight from the other forecasters on institutional momentum and cross-sector policy consistency, I’m nudging my forecast up modestly while still reserving probability mass for the web-copy/placement risk. Change: 83% -> 87%.",
