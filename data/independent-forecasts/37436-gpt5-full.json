  "information": "As of April 30, 2025, the official UN OCHA impact snapshot reported 295 UN staff fatalities in Gaza. Reports from late April cited UNRWA stating that 295 of its personnel had died since October 7, 2023. This number reflects a steady increase over time; a UN report on March 19, 2025, had stated at least 280 UN employees were killed, and an OCHA report cited on January 9, 2025, listed 263 UNRWA staff fatalities. Broader figures for humanitarian workers indicate a higher total toll; an OCHA report on April 23, 2025, stated that at least 418 humanitarian workers, including the 295 UN staff, had been killed in Gaza since the conflict began. A specific incident on March 23, 2025, resulted in the deaths of 15 humanitarian personnel, including staff from the Palestinian Red Crescent and one UN staff member.\n\nThe United Nations has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, exacerbated by a blockade that severely restricts access to aid, food, water, and medical supplies. In early May 2025, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher called the aid blockade a form of 'cruel collective punishment,' noting that over 3,000 aid trucks were stalled at the border. According to OCHA reports from late April and early May 2025, insecurity and access restrictions have compelled humanitarian organizations to close nutrition centers. The same reports indicated an 80% rise in children being treated for malnutrition and that 65% of residents lack access to clean drinking water. The UN Population Fund also announced it had exhausted its supply of emergency shelter materials and hygiene products.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Israel's security cabinet reportedly approved a plan to intensify military operations in the Gaza Strip. This follows a period of renewed violence since a ceasefire broke down in mid-March 2025. The UN has described Gaza as one of the most dangerous places in the world for humanitarian workers, with its personnel and facilities at risk from military activity. The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has stated that humanitarian efforts are severely hindered by severe restrictions on movement within the territory. The International Red Cross also noted that the deteriorating security situation is hindering the work of its staff and partners.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the latest OCHA impact snapshot (April 30, 2025) reports 295 UN staff fatalities",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "OCHA posts no further impact snapshots before July 1 (so April 30’s 295 stands), or the May/June snapshots remain below 300 (e.g., 297–299), or a late revision brings the final pre–July 1 snapshot back under 300",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one new impact snapshot before July 1 (e.g., end-May or end-June) reports ≥300 UN staff fatalities, reflecting additional deaths or late confirmations pushing the cumulative total over the threshold",
    "rationale": "Baseline: As of April 30, 2025, OCHA’s impact snapshot lists 295 UN staff killed in Gaza. Earlier figures show a steady rise: ~263 (Jan 9), ~280 (Mar 19), 295 (Apr 30). That is +15 from Mar 19 to Apr 30 (~6 weeks), implying roughly 2–3 additional UN staff deaths per week during that period. Only five more deaths are needed to reach 300. OCHA typically issues monthly snapshots, so there are likely one or two more snapshots (end-May and/or end-June) before July 1. The operating environment remains extremely dangerous for aid workers. The RA notes OCHA reported at least 418 humanitarian workers killed by late April (including the 295 UN staff) and cites escalating operations and access constraints in early May, which are more likely to increase, not decrease, risk. Given trend, proximity to the threshold, and the likelihood of continued reporting, crossing 300 by the final pre–July 1 snapshot is more likely than not. Why not higher: There is a non-trivial chance OCHA pauses or stops posting this specific snapshot series before July 1, in which case the April 30 figure (295) would lock the outcome as No. It’s also possible the casualty rate among UN staff slows due to reduced field presence, evacuations, or altered operations, or that verification lags keep the reported number under 300 through the final pre–July 1 release. Rare downward revisions could also keep the final number below 300 even if an interim update exceeds it. Why not lower: The historical trend is upward, the threshold is close (+5), and conflict dynamics (including a planned Israeli intensification in May/June) likely sustain high risk to UN personnel. What would move me up: Confirmation of additional UN staff deaths, OCHA continuing monthly snapshots, and/or a May snapshot at ≥298. What would move me down: Indications OCHA will not issue further snapshots before July 1, a sustained ceasefire or major UN drawdown sharply reducing exposure, or authoritative reports that there have been no additional UN staff fatalities since April 30.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025.
