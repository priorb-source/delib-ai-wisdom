    "review": "The other two forecasters provide sound and well-structured analyses, arriving at a consensus forecast of 35%. Our reasoning aligns on the central tension: Donald Trump's personal diplomatic style and the urgency of the Ukraine war push towards 'Yes', while diplomatic inertia, political risks, and the narrow time window push towards 'No'. Forecaster 2 introduced two points I hadn't sufficiently weighed: the domestic political risk for Trump in holding the call, and, more importantly, the high resolution bar requiring public acknowledgement from *both* sides. A call could occur but not be mutually acknowledged for strategic reasons, making this an important potential failure point for a 'Yes' resolution. Forecaster 3 made a convincing argument about the specific timing, suggesting that May-June, being about four months into a new term, is a very plausible window for a major foreign policy initiative after an initial settling-in period. This counters my initial view that a potential February call would make a May call *less* likely.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I have decided to maintain my forecast of 30%. Their arguments were persuasive and highlighted factors I had under-weighed, but they ultimately reinforced my initial assessment of a finely balanced situation rather than shifting it definitively. Forecaster 3's point that the May-June timeframe is a plausible action window for a new administration effectively neutralizes my initial concern that a hypothetical February call would mostly preclude a call in this period. However, this upward pressure on my forecast is counteracted by Forecaster 2's excellent point about the resolution criteria requiring acknowledgement from *both* sides. This is a significant hurdle that I had not fully appreciated. The strategic incentives for a mutual, public acknowledgement may not align, even if a call does take place. Given that these two new considerations pull in opposite directions, my estimate of the overall probability has not changed. I remain slightly more pessimistic than my peers, placing a bit more weight on the specific and stringent resolution criteria and the inherent difficulties of scheduling and executing such a high-stakes, publicly-acknowledged call within a tight 34-day window. The 5-point difference between our forecasts reflects a minor disagreement on how heavily to weigh these competing factors.",
