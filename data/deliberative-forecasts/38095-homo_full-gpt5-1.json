    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the very low threshold (>2) and the existence of an active clemency pipeline staffed to produce ongoing output. They also highlight timing risks: a potential July 4 clustering, month-to-month lumpiness after a late-May blitz, and the requirement that actions be publicly disclosed within June. Forecaster 3 adds a useful angle about potential June hooks (e.g., themed or symbolic dates like Juneteenth) that could motivate at least a small tranche. Neither presents new hard evidence beyond what I used, but their framing strengthens the case that even a modest June drip would clear the bar. I find their reasoning largely convincing; the main downside remains strategic bunching for early July or a short-term pause after the May spree.",
    "rationale": "I slightly increase my probability. The core logic holds: the administration’s demonstrated pace, infrastructure (OPA leadership, WH clemency lead), and explicit signaling of more to come make a complete June lull unlikely, and the bar is very low. Even a minor set of actions or a themed announcement would suffice. The principal downside is a tactical decision to hold grants for a July 4 package, plus some chance of near-term queue depletion or optics-driven pause. Balancing these, the consensus arguments modestly raise my confidence that we’ll see >2 publicly disclosed June actions. I move up from 80% to 84%.",
