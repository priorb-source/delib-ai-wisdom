    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until June 30, 2025, inclusive)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite high-level approval, BTRC licensing, spectrum/landing rights, import clearances, and/or a local gateway or compliance conditions take more than six weeks. Starlink keeps Bangladesh marked as “Coming Soon/2025” and does not flip the map to “Available” before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the leader’s final approval, BTRC issues the operational license quickly, commercial terms are settled (possibly with a local partner), and initial logistics are cleared. Starlink enables service via laser backhaul to an existing regional gateway and updates the map to “Available” in Bangladesh within weeks.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: There are roughly 1.5 months left. The status quo on the map today is not “Available,” so the default outcome is No unless Starlink and Bangladesh complete the remaining steps quickly.\n- Evidence and base rates: After regulatory greenlights, Starlink has sometimes moved from approval to availability within weeks (e.g., some Asia-Pacific and African cases), but in other countries post-approval execution has taken longer due to licensing formalities, spectrum/landing-rights specifics, import rules, and local compliance. Bangladesh’s regulatory environment is relatively controlled; data localization/monitoring expectations or a requirement for a local gateway could add friction.\n- The Anadolu Agency report that the Bangladeshi leader gave final approval is a strong positive signal, but it may not mean all operational licenses and compliance conditions are fully concluded. Starlink typically updates its map when customers can place orders; that depends on license issuance and practical ability to deliver/activate terminals.\n- Why not higher: Only ~6 weeks remain; any bureaucratic lag, partner negotiations, or gateway/monitoring requirements could push go-live into Q3 2025.\n- Why not lower: SpaceX sometimes executes quickly once the political decision is made; if BTRC paperwork is already in motion and Starlink can leverage existing regional gateways via laser links, flipping Bangladesh to “Available” by late June is plausible.\n- What would move me up: Official BTRC license issuance, announcement of a local partner/distributor, evidence of terminals cleared for import, or Starlink adding Bangladesh to its order page with near-term delivery windows.\n- What would move me down: Reports of additional regulatory conditions (e.g., mandatory local gateway/monitoring build-out), pushback from domestic operators, customs/Type Approval delays, or Starlink’s map showing only “Targeting late 2025.”\n- Research assistant summary: No additional info beyond the cited article; forecast relies on general Starlink rollout patterns and regulatory considerations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Bangladesh as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Bangladeshi leader gives final approval to Musk's Starlink service](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/bangladeshi-leader-gives-final-approval-to-musks-starlink-service/3551404)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Bangladesh listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
