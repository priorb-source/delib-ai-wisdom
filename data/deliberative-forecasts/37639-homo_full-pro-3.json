    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental dynamics of this question. We all identify the central conflict as the very short timeline (under seven weeks) versus the typically slow pace of the U.S. judicial system, especially when a federal court's temporary restraining order (TRO) is in place. All three of us correctly pinpoint the judge's finding of \"plausible\" First Amendment claims as the key factor strengthening the legal barrier to deportation. The primary difference is a minor one of weighting. Forecaster 2's analysis at 10% is nearly identical to my initial reasoning. Forecaster 3, at 15%, places slightly more emphasis on the ability of intense political will from the executive branch to potentially expedite the legal process. This is a subtle but important point that I had not weighed as heavily.",
    "rationale": "I am slightly increasing my forecast from 10% to 12%. The deliberation process was valuable. While my core analysis remains the same—that the legal hurdles and short timeline make deportation highly unlikely—I am persuaded by Forecaster 3's reasoning that I may have slightly underestimated the chance that the executive branch's intense focus on this case could accelerate the judicial proceedings. The government, citing national security and foreign policy concerns, might successfully petition the court for an expedited hearing on the preliminary injunction. While the court is by no means obligated to grant this, the high political profile of the case makes it a non-trivial possibility. This acceleration would slightly increase the chances that a legal window for deportation could open before the July 1 deadline. This adjustment from 10% to 12% reflects this added consideration, acknowledging a greater-than-initially-forecasted risk of a rapid, politically-driven legal outcome against Khalil.",
