  "information": "Multiple news outlets, including RotoWire on May 6, 2025, and MMA Fighting on May 9, 2025, reported that Johnny Walker had withdrawn from his scheduled bout against Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316. The reason provided for the withdrawal was an injury. Walker's official Wikipedia page was also updated to reflect his withdrawal from the event.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known on the date of the UFC 316 event, which is expected to occur in mid-2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The fight is reported to be cancelled due to a withdrawal by Johnny Walker.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The reports of Johnny Walker's injury and withdrawal are accurate. The fight against Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316 does not happen, causing the question to resolve to 'No'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The initial reports of Walker's withdrawal are proven to be incorrect or his injury is extremely minor. The fight is subsequently reinstated for the UFC 316 card, and Johnny Walker proceeds to win the match.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based almost entirely on the research provided, indicating that multiple reputable news outlets have reported Johnny Walker's withdrawal from the UFC 316 bout due to an injury. The status quo is that the fight is off. The resolution criteria explicitly state that if Walker does not fight Murzakanov at this event, the outcome is 'No'. Therefore, the likelihood of a 'Yes' outcome is exceptionally low. My forecast is not zero because there is a remote, non-zero possibility that the reports are inaccurate or that an unprecedented series of events leads to the fight being re-booked for the same card. This would require the injury to be insignificant and for both the UFC and the opponent's camp to agree to reinstate the fight, which is highly unusual. The probability is not any higher because the evidence for the cancellation is multi-sourced and credible within the MMA reporting community. For me to raise this forecast, I would need to see official statements from the UFC or Johnny Walker's team refuting the withdrawal reports and confirming the fight is proceeding as scheduled.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Johnny Walker defeats Azamat Murzakanov at [UFC 316](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_316).\n\nIf Walker does not fight anyone at UFC 316 or fights someone else, this resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMultiple news outlets, including RotoWire on May 6, 2025, and MMA Fighting on May 9, 2025, reported that Johnny Walker had withdrawn from his scheduled bout against Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316. The reason provided for the withdrawal was an injury. Walker's official Wikipedia page was also updated to reflect his withdrawal from the event.\n\nToday is 2025-05-26.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
