  "information": "The 2026 Florida gubernatorial race involves several candidates. For the Republican nomination, Congressman Byron Donalds has launched his campaign and received an endorsement from former President Trump. Other potential Republican candidates include Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis, former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, and Lt. Governor Jeanette Nuñez. On the Democratic side, former U.S. Representative David Jolly has announced his candidacy. State senator Jason Pizzo also announced he will run as an independent. Florida's primary election is scheduled for August 18, 2026, with the general election on November 3, 2026.\n\nAs of early June 2025, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has publicly stated he is considering a run for governor. A poll conducted by The James Madison Institute in May 2025 showed Suarez with 5% support in the Republican primary field. In local politics, the Miami City Commission was set to vote on a proposal to move the city's November election to 2026, which would extend the terms of current commissioners and Mayor Suarez by one year.\n\nHistorically, in the last two open Florida gubernatorial cycles (2018 and 2022), major candidates typically announced their campaigns 12 to 18 months before the primary election. For the 2026 cycle, some contenders, such as Republican Byron Donalds and Democrat David Jolly, had already announced their candidacies by early June 2025. Reports note that as of early June, there have been no leaks of a launch date, no exploratory committee paperwork filed by Suarez, and no scheduled kickoff events for a gubernatorial campaign.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Francis Suarez has not announced his candidacy for governor and will not do so before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Francis Suarez continues to publicly state he is considering a run for governor but does not make a formal announcement or file official paperwork before the July 1, 2025 deadline, choosing to wait and assess the political landscape further.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seeking to gain an edge in a developing Republican primary field and begin fundraising before the end of the second quarter, Francis Suarez holds a press conference in Miami before July 1, 2025, to formally announce he is running for Governor of Florida.",
    "rationale": "The primary factor driving this forecast is the extremely short timeframe. With the deadline of July 1, 2025, less than a month away, there are no public indicators that a major campaign announcement is imminent. My research assistant's report confirms there have been no leaks of a launch date, no exploratory committee has been filed, and no kickoff events are scheduled. Launching a statewide gubernatorial campaign is a significant logistical undertaking that is typically preceded by such signals. The current status quo is that Suarez is only 'considering' a bid, a common exploratory position that does not commit him to a timeline. While other candidates have already declared, Suarez's relatively low polling at 5% suggests he may benefit from a more strategic, longer-term approach rather than a rushed announcement. My probability is not lower because a surprise announcement is always possible in politics, and he may feel pressure to declare before the Q2 fundraising deadline on June 30th. My probability is not higher because the complete lack of logistical groundwork makes an announcement within the next 26 days highly improbable. I would increase my forecast if there were leaks of a planned announcement or if campaign paperwork were filed. I would decrease it if Suarez publicly stated he would make a decision 'later this year'.",
