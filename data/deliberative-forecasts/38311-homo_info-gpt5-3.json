    "review": "Both added concrete, near-term signals I hadn’t explicitly cited: official participant lists including Trump as of June 3, Canadian controlled-access and airspace restrictions (June 10–18), and evidence of U.S. engagement via preparatory meetings. These materially reduce risks of postponement or format change and indicate logistics are locked. The arguments about proximity (Canada) further lower operational risk. I find their reasoning sound; tail risks they note (health, crisis, security, weather, boycott) remain but are low probability in a 12-day window.",
    "rationale": "Status quo strongly favors attendance: the White House has confirmed the trip; official participant lists now include Trump; Canada’s security footprint and airspace restrictions are in place for mid-June; and pre-summit bilats (e.g., Scholz at the White House on June 5) point to normal leader-level engagement. G7 attendance by U.S. presidents is historically near-universal, and the event’s timing and location reduce logistical risk. The Nikkei report about potential lack of a joint communiqué does not undermine attendance; if anything it underscores the need for in-person negotiation. Residual downside risks persist—sudden health issues, an urgent domestic/international crisis, a credible security threat, or severe disruption—but with firm logistics and a short time horizon, these remain tail events. Given the added evidence (official lists and host-country security measures), I’m nudging my estimate up slightly from 93% to 95%.",
