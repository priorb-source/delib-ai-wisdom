    "review": "My initial forecast of 25% now appears too high after reviewing my colleagues' analyses. Forecaster 2 presented compelling external evidence I had not fully weighed, specifically that major bank analysts (Goldman, BofA, Morgan Stanley) have pushed their consensus for the first rate cut to July or later. Forecaster 3 reinforced this with another crucial data point: CME FedWatch probabilities, a direct measure of market pricing, also point to a cut in September or later. Both forecasters correctly emphasized the extremely limited timeframe, with only one FOMC meeting before the resolution date, and the rarity of inter-meeting cuts absent a crisis. Their arguments that recent resilient economic data (e.g., jobs reports) further diminish the urgency for a cut are convincing and align with my initial assessment, but the inclusion of these market-based indicators provides a much stronger quantitative anchor for a lower probability.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast down from 25% to 15%. The new evidence from my peers, particularly the consensus of bank analysts and market pricing via FedWatch, has persuaded me that my initial forecast was insufficiently skeptical of a near-term cut. I had placed too much weight on the Fed's 2025 projection for two cuts and not enough on the powerful inertia and the very strong signals from informed market participants that these cuts are back-loaded to the second half of the year. The Fed dislikes surprising markets, and with the market clearly not pricing in a June cut, the bar for such a move becomes exceptionally high. It would require a series of shockingly weak economic data releases in the next few weeks. While a downside shock is still possible, the path to a pre-July cut is much narrower than I first estimated. My new forecast of 15% aligns more closely with my peers' reasoning, reflecting the high bar for a June cut while still acknowledging the non-zero chance of a rapid data deterioration or a financial stability event forcing the Fed's hand.",
