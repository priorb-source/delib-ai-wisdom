    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize two constraints: (1) the binding ceiling keeps TPDO flat near ~$36.2T until lifted, and (2) to reach ≥$37T by June 27 requires both an earlier-than-usual deal (around mid-June) and a fast unwind/issuance cadence that adds roughly $0.8T in days. They also highlight that June 27 is a business day, so the dataset should report that day, limiting reliance on the “first date after” clause. Their focus on timing incentives (BPC’s X-date window later than late June, suggesting less urgency to act by mid-June) increases the weight on the status quo No. I find their reasoning solid and largely consistent with my own, with the main incremental point being stronger emphasis on Congressional timing relative to the likely later X-date window, which pushes the odds modestly lower. I didn’t see new quantitative evidence that the immediate post-lift jump would exceed ~$800B by June 27 absent a mid-June deal, and they appropriately flag that prior catch-ups were ~+$360B next day and ~+$600B within a week.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: TPDO is about $36.2T and constrained by the reinstated limit. To resolve Yes, the gap to $37T is ≈$0.8T by June 27. Historical unwind magnitudes suggest ~+$0.36T next day and ~+$0.6T within a week after a lift; getting to +$0.8T by June 27 thus likely requires a deal by roughly mid-June and an aggressive issuance/TGA rebuild schedule. Political timing argues against that: Treasury’s letter points to around June 27 as the limit for extraordinary measures, but BPC’s later X-date window reduces pressure to act much earlier than that. If a deal lands on or near June 27, there’s little time for the reported total to exceed $37T that same day. Conversely, if no deal by that date, TPDO stays capped below $37T. I still allow non-trivial probability for a mid-June resolution plus rapid catch-up, and acknowledge that today’s financing needs could support a larger immediate rebuild than in 2023. However, on balance, the added weight on later X-date expectations and the need for both an early deal and unusually fast execution nudges me slightly down from my prior 25% to 22%. Key updaters: credible reports of a mid-June deal and Treasury signaling heavy near-term bill issuance would move me up; signs of slippage beyond late June or updated guidance extending extraordinary measures into July would move me down.",
