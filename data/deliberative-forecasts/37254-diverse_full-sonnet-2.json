    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments for lower probabilities. Forecaster 2 and 3 both emphasize points I underweighted: (1) The US policy shift in February 2025 - voting against UN resolutions demanding Russian withdrawal - signals a desire for de-escalation and suggests the US would be less inclined to make inflammatory accusations unless facing unambiguous aggression. This is a significant constraint I didn't fully appreciate. (2) The complete lack of Western intelligence or independent think tank corroboration for Ukraine's 150,000 troops in Belarus claim is telling. If such a buildup existed, RUSI, CSIS, or Western intelligence would likely have detected it. (3) Forecaster 3's detailed theater analysis is excellent - each potential target has specific, significant constraints. The Moldova/Transnistria scenario requires logistics Russia currently lacks; NATO targets risk Article 5; Georgia and Belarus have specific complications. (4) Forecaster 3 notes West-2025 exercises may be 'later in the year' - if after July 1, they're irrelevant to this resolution. However, I still see value in maintaining slightly higher probability than 3-5% because: (1) Two months isn't extraordinarily short for military events, (2) Russia has demonstrated capacity for rapid, unexpected moves, (3) The US policy shift, while notable, doesn't preclude accusations if clear invasion occurs, (4) We can't fully rule out Moldova/Transnistria flashpoints or other tail scenarios.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating downward from 10% to 6%. The most compelling new considerations are: (1) The February 2025 US diplomatic shift is more significant than I initially weighted - voting against withdrawal demands signals genuine de-escalation efforts that would make inflammatory accusations less likely unless provoked by undeniable aggression, (2) The complete absence of Western intelligence corroboration for Ukrainian warnings about Belarus suggests those warnings may be intended to maintain support rather than reflecting genuine near-term threats, (3) The detailed constraint analysis shows each potential theater faces specific, substantial barriers. However, I'm not going as low as 3% because: (1) Russia retains capability for limited operations despite Ukraine commitments, (2) Moldova/Transnistria remains a viable flashpoint with existing Russian presence, (3) The two-month window, while short, has seen rapid geopolitical changes historically, (4) The US would still accuse Russia if a clear invasion occurred regardless of diplomatic preferences. My 6% reflects heightened skepticism about near-term invasion probability while maintaining appropriate tail risk allowance for unexpected developments.",
