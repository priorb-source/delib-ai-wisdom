    "review": "Forecaster 2 highlighted a crucial point I had not incorporated correctly: Berkshire’s Amazon stake has been exactly 10,000,000 shares for a long stretch, and the resolution criterion is strictly >10,000,000. That flips the base case from “already Yes” to “No unless they added,” which is a material correction to my prior view. Their emphasis on Berkshire’s recent net-selling posture and trims to large tech (e.g., Apple) also lowers the likelihood of a buy in AMZN during Q1. Forecaster 3’s points about Berkshire’s defensive stance and AMZN’s valuation echo the same directional push toward a lower probability, but they didn’t fully engage with the hard threshold issue; the key is not whether 10M is achievable, but whether they moved above it in Q1. Overall, F2’s threshold framing is the most persuasive and directly changes my base case.",
    "rationale": "I’m revising down substantially because my earlier assumption that Berkshire’s AMZN holdings were already above 10M appears likely wrong; multiple trackers historically show a flat 10,000,000-share position post-split. Given that, a “Yes” outcome requires an incremental purchase in Q1 2025. Overlaying Berkshire’s recent pattern of building cash and being a net seller, plus trimming in mega-cap tech, the odds of adding to AMZN in Q1 look modest. I allow some chance for a deputy-driven add if they saw idiosyncratic value or wanted to scale the position slightly, but with no evidence of a Q1 tech drawdown or explicit signals from Berkshire, that tail seems limited. I also include a small probability of outcomes like confidential treatment or a trim, both of which would keep the position at or below 10M and resolve No. Net: I move from 82% to 22%, reflecting the corrected base case and Berkshire’s recent portfolio stance.",
