  "information": "This is a rematch for the UFC bantamweight title, scheduled to headline UFC 316 on June 7-8, 2025, in Newark, New Jersey. In their first fight at UFC 306 in September 2024, Merab Dvalishvili defeated Sean O'Malley by unanimous decision to win the championship. Commentator Joe Rogan has questioned how O'Malley gets past Dvalishvili's abilities, and former champion Henry Cejudo has referred to Dvalishvili as the greatest bantamweight of all time.\n\nMerab Dvalishvili is the current UFC bantamweight champion and is on a 12-fight winning streak. His last fight was a unanimous decision victory over Umar Nurmagomedov in January 2025, marking his first successful title defense. In the weeks leading up to the fight, Dvalishvili has reported suffering minor injuries to his finger and a toe on his right foot during training, but stated his intention to compete regardless.\n\nSean O'Malley is the former bantamweight champion. This fight will be his first since undergoing hip surgery in October 2024 following his loss to Dvalishvili. In preparation for the rematch, O'Malley has been sparring with former UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya. O'Malley has stated he is confident in his skills and expects to be significantly better than he was in the first fight post-surgery.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12 days (event on June 7–8, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Fight proceeds as scheduled and Dvalishvili wins a decision via pressure wrestling and control.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Bout is canceled or an opponent change occurs before UFC 316; or the fight happens and O’Malley wins or the result is a draw/NC.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Dvalishvili fights Sean O’Malley at UFC 316 and wins by decision, TKO/KO, or submission.",
    "rationale": "Two components drive this: (1) the fight actually occurring as Dvalishvili vs. O’Malley, and (2) Dvalishvili’s win chance conditional on the bout happening. With ~12 days to go, late cancellations still happen but are less likely; minor finger/toe issues for Dvalishvili are noted but he intends to compete. If the matchup holds, the status quo favors Dvalishvili: he already beat O’Malley by clear unanimous decision in their first meeting (per the assistant) and subsequently defended against Umar Nurmagomedov, reinforcing a style edge built on elite cardio, chain wrestling, and pace over five rounds. O’Malley’s paths are sharp counters and a possible KO, plus improvements post-hip surgery and targeted prep (training with Adesanya), which raise his ceiling. Those factors, along with judging variance and small risks of a draw/NC, keep the probability from being higher. It’s not lower because the recent head-to-head result, matchup dynamics, and Dvalishvili’s form (12-fight streak, first title defense) are strong, while O’Malley returns from surgery and a layoff. I would update upward if weigh-ins and late-week reports confirm both are 100% and betting markets shift further toward Dvalishvili; I’d move downward on credible news of aggravated injuries, compromised weight cuts, or sharp market movement toward O’Malley indicating improved defensive wrestling or specific tactical edges.",
