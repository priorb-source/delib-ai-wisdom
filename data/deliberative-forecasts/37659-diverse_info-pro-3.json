    "review": "The other two forecasters anchor their analyses on a central, critical misunderstanding of the provided evidence. Both Forecaster 2 (48%) and Forecaster 3 (30%) repeatedly state that their primary source of uncertainty is an 'unknown current baseline' on May 16. However, the research report explicitly provides a very recent and specific baseline: 105 objectives were classified as 'Done' on April 16. Their entire reasoning, which speculates on scenarios where the count might be 60 or 80, is built on a false premise. They seem to have completely missed or disregarded the most important piece of data in the prompt. While they raise valid secondary points, such as the tendency for policy momentum to slow and the oppositional nature of the tracker, these do not justify such low probabilities. In fact, Forecaster 2's point about the tracker's oppositional viewpoint could be interpreted as a bullish signal, suggesting their criteria for 'Done' are strict and the 105 baseline is robust. Forecaster 3's point about high traffic confirms the tracker is actively maintained, reducing the risk of a 'No' outcome from stale data. Because their fundamental models are based on ignoring the provided data, I find their reasoning and low-probability forecasts unconvincing.",
    "rationale": "I will not be changing my forecast. My initial analysis rests on a straightforward calculation based on the specific data provided in the research report, data that the other forecasters seemingly ignored. The state of play as of April 16 was 105 completed objectives. To reach the threshold of 120 by July 1, an additional 15 objectives must be completed in the 76 days between those dates. This requires a completion rate of just under 0.2 objectives per day. \n\nThe most recent observed rate, between April 8 (100 Done) and April 16 (105 Done), was 5 objectives in 8 days, or 0.625 objectives per day. This rate is more than three times what is needed to meet the target. Furthermore, the report notes that 44 other objectives are already 'in progress', making it overwhelmingly likely that at least 15 of them will transition to 'Done' over a 2.5-month period. \n\nThe other panelists' concerns about policy friction are valid, but this was already factored into my initial forecast of 90%, which accounts for a potential slowdown. Their arguments for a much lower probability are based on a flawed reading of the available evidence. No new information or compelling counter-argument has been presented to change the fundamental and very favorable arithmetic of this forecast. The project needs to complete objectives at one-third of its recent pace to succeed; therefore, a high probability of a 'Yes' outcome remains the most logical conclusion.",
