    "review": "Forecaster 2 appears unaware that the tariff is currently suspended - they discuss it as if it's actively in effect. Forecaster 3 correctly recognizes that suspended tariffs count as Yes but expresses uncertainty about whether the tariff has been formally implemented in the HTS yet. This is a crucial gap. According to my research assistant, the tariff IS already formally listed under subheading 9903.01.60 but marked as suspended through July 9, 2025. If this information is accurate, it fundamentally changes the analysis - we're not waiting for implementation or hoping the status quo holds, we're asking whether something already listed will be removed in 38 days. The other forecasters raise valid concerns about negotiation dynamics and Switzerland's leverage, but they seem to miss that suspension (which keeps the listing intact) is actually the negotiating strategy being used. Complete removal during active negotiations would eliminate US leverage.",
    "rationale": "My research assistant provided specific information that neither other forecaster appears to have: the tariff is currently listed under subheading 9903.01.60 as 31% but suspended until July 9, 2025. The resolution criteria explicitly state suspended listings count as Yes. This means the status quo ALREADY satisfies the resolution criteria. For a No outcome, the administration would need to completely remove Switzerland from the HTS listing (not just suspend it) or change the rate from 31% in the next 38 days. Removal during the 90-day negotiation window seems unlikely as it would eliminate leverage. However, I'm updating slightly downward from 87% to acknowledge: (1) epistemic uncertainty - the other forecasters' lower confidence suggests I may be overconfident in my information source; (2) Forecaster 3's valid point about uncertainty regarding formal implementation status; (3) the possibility of administrative complications or errors I haven't fully considered. Still, if my research assistant's information is accurate (and the specificity suggests it is), this should resolve Yes with high probability. The key insight remains that suspension doesn't prevent Yes resolution, and complete removal in 38 days during active negotiations is unlikely.",
