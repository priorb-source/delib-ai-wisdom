  "information": "China's manufacturing activity contracted for the second consecutive month in May, with the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) standing at 49.5, below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. The non-manufacturing PMI also showed a slight decline to 50.3 in May from 50.4 in the previous month. In the property sector, new-home sales from the 100 largest developers fell by 8.6% year-on-year in May, following an 8.7% drop in April.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1–2 weeks (China’s May CPI is typically released around June 10–12; FRED is updated shortly after).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — CPI YoY has been negative in recent months; absent a clear positive shock, another slight deflation print is more likely than not.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Holiday-driven services inflation (May Day travel), modest rebounds in food (notably pork) and energy lift YoY CPI to 0.0% or slightly positive.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Weak domestic demand persists; continued discounting and soft food prices outweigh any services uptick, keeping YoY CPI modestly below zero.",
    "rationale": "- Framing: The resolution depends only on whether China’s May 2025 CPI YoY (FRED series CHNCPIALLMINMEI) is negative. Recent reports indicate April was negative, implying three straight months already; May would be the fourth if still below 0.\n- Status quo weight: Good practice is to overweight the existing trend. With recent CPI prints below zero and no clear demand acceleration, the base case is a small negative again in May.\n- Current signals: Your assistant notes May manufacturing PMI at 49.5 (contraction), non-manufacturing at 50.3 (barely expansion), and another large YoY drop in new-home sales. These point to weak domestic demand, consistent with ongoing disinflation/deflation pressure.\n- Seasonal and base effects: May often sees some services price firming from the Labor Day holiday, which could nudge CPI toward zero. Food seasonality can be soft in May (vegetables/fruit), while pork is the swing factor. Energy effects look muted. Hence, the balance is close to the zero line.\n- Why not higher: Three consecutive negative YoY readings, weak PMIs, and property drag make a clean move to positive less likely without a clear upside shock in services or food.\n- Why not lower: Holiday services inflation, potential pork price firmness, and the possibility that deflation has been narrowing make a zero or +0.1% print plausible.\n- What would move me up: Evidence of continued discounting late in May, weak high-frequency food prices (including pork), and falling fuel prices; further deterioration in service activity. \n- What would move me down: Strong tourism/transport price data from the May Day holiday, clear pork price increases into late May, or reports of broader services inflation surprising to the upside.\nNet: Slightly more likely than not that May YoY CPI remains below zero, but it’s a close call near the threshold.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill China experience a 4th month in a row of deflation in its May CPI report?\n\nQuestion background:\nSCMP: [China’s consumer prices fall in April, fuelling fears of deflation](https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3309834/chinas-consumer-prices-fall-april-fuelling-fears-deflation)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the \"Percent Change from Year Ago, Not Seasonally Adjusted\" data presented at [FRED Consumer Price Indices (CPIs, HICPs), COICOP 1999: Consumer Price Index: Total for China (CHNCPIALLMINMEI)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CHNCPIALLMINMEI#) is negative for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nChina's manufacturing activity contracted for the second consecutive month in May, with the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) standing at 49.5, below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
