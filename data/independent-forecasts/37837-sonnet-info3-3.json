  "information": "Public interest in UFO-related topics is supported by ongoing events and media attention. The 11th annual 'Contact in the Desert' conference, a major gathering for UFO experts and enthusiasts, is scheduled to run from May 29 to June 2, 2025, in California. Regionally, Washington state ranks third in the U.S. for the total number of UFO reports submitted to NUFORC, and several sightings have been reported from the state's Columbia Basin region since the beginning of 2025. The topic of UAPs also continues to receive attention from mainstream news outlets and the U.S. Congress.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025, when data for June 2025 sightings becomes available on NUFORC's website.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the threshold of 400 sightings is not exceeded. Based on the long-term historical average of approximately 300 reports per month (180,000 reports over 50 years), normal conditions would result in fewer than 400 reports.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 sees typical reporting patterns with approximately 300-350 sightings reported to NUFORC. No major UFO incidents occur to drive exceptional public interest. The Contact in the Desert conference generates some reporting activity in early June but not enough to significantly elevate the monthly total above 400.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A combination of factors drives elevated reporting: the Contact in the Desert conference (May 29-June 2) stimulates increased awareness and reporting in early June; ongoing Congressional attention to UAPs maintains elevated public interest; a notable sighting event occurs during June generating media coverage; and summer weather conditions across the U.S. lead to more people outdoors observing the sky, resulting in over 400 reports for the month.",
    "rationale": "The historical baseline suggests approximately 300 reports per month (180,000 over 50 years equals ~3,600 per year). However, this average masks potential changes in reporting patterns over time. Recent years have likely seen elevated reporting due to increased mainstream legitimacy of UFO/UAP topics through Congressional hearings and media coverage. The threshold of 400 represents approximately 33% above the historical average. The Contact in the Desert conference running from May 29-June 2 could stimulate early June reporting, and Washington state's high ranking for UFO reports (#3 nationally) suggests regional activity. However, I lack specific data on recent monthly reporting rates, which creates uncertainty. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the historical average is below 400, (2) one conference alone may not drive a 33%+ increase in monthly reporting, and (3) status quo outcomes typically prevail. My forecast is not lower because: (1) recent years likely show higher reporting than the 50-year average due to increased UAP legitimacy, (2) the summer timing and conference could create favorable conditions, and (3) mainstream attention continues. I would update higher if shown recent monthly data consistently exceeding 350-400 reports, or if a major UFO incident occurred in late May or early June. I would update lower if recent monthly data showed consistent reporting below 300.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of UFO sightings reported by the National UFO Reporting Center exceed 400 for June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts greater than 400 UFO/UAP sighting reports at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) for the month of June 2025, as displayed when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nPublic interest in UFO-related topics is supported by ongoing events and media attention. The 11th annual 'Contact in the Desert' conference, a major gathering for UFO experts and enthusiasts, is scheduled to run from May 29 to June 2, 2025, in California. Regionally, Washington state ranks third in the U.S. for the total number of UFO reports submitted to NUFORC, and several sightings have been reported from the state's Columbia Basin region since the beginning of 2025. The topic of UAPs also continues to receive attention from mainstream news outlets and the U.S. Congress.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
