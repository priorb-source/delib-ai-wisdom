  "information": "Joe Rogan, a prominent UFC commentator, has publicly announced he will not be attending UFC 315 in Montreal. He cited his discontent with the Canadian government as the reason, stating he 'doesn't go to Canada anymore' and would 'rather go to Russia.' Rogan also mentioned that he had discussed US-Canada relations with Donald Trump, who had joked about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Likely ~1–2 months (UFC 315 is expected around early-to-mid June 2025); resolution occurs on event night.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "UFC 315 is held in Montreal and Trump does not travel to Canada due to political optics, legal/admissibility or security complications, or conflicting commitments.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump travels to the UFC 315 venue (e.g., Bell Centre in Montreal) and makes an appearance anywhere on the grounds—cageside, backstage, or in a suite—possibly as a surprise guest alongside Dana White.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Trump frequently attends high-profile UFC PPVs in the United States (Miami, Las Vegas, New York/New Jersey), but there is no precedent for him attending UFC events in Canada. If UFC 315 is indeed in Montreal, the default (status quo) is that he does not go. Canada-specific headwinds: (1) Potential admissibility issues if he has any disqualifying criminal convictions or court-imposed travel constraints; Canada can deem such individuals inadmissible absent a waiver (TRP). (2) Political optics and security complexity for a polarizing figure in a foreign country, likely drawing protests and substantial coordination with Canadian authorities. (3) Trump’s strained relations with Canadian leadership and his own rhetoric make a discretionary Canadian trip for leisure/spectacle less likely. Conditional on office status: If Trump is the sitting President in 2025, a non-official trip to a foreign sports event is extremely unlikely. If he is not President, attendance is still low given the above Canada-specific factors, though not impossible given his relationship with Dana White and his history of showing up at UFC PPVs. Research assistant info incorporated: Joe Rogan publicly said he won’t attend UFC 315 in Montreal, adding he doesn’t go to Canada anymore and mentioning having discussed US–Canada relations with Trump (including a Trudeau joke). While Rogan’s decision isn’t dispositive for Trump, it is directionally consistent with reluctance among Trump-aligned figures to attend an event in Canada and hints Trump may not be eager to go. Why not higher: International venue (Canada), admissibility/legal uncertainties, optics/security burdens, and atypicality of such a trip make attendance unlikely. Why not lower: Trump’s unpredictability, strong ties to Dana White, and a pattern of enjoying UFC spotlights create a non-zero chance—especially if logistics align and he is not constrained by office or legal terms. What would move me up: (a) Confirmed reports that UFC 315 is in the U.S. (if the venue changes), (b) credible reports of Trump planning Canadian travel around that date, (c) indication Canadian authorities granted or are facilitating entry, (d) UFC/Dana White teasing or confirming a Trump appearance. What would move me down: (a) Firm confirmation of Montreal as host with no travel facilitation signals, (b) known schedule conflicts or legal restrictions, (c) heightened security/protest risks or Canadian refusal/complications for entry.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump is anywhere within the grounds of the venue where [UFC 315](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-315) takes place. Otherwise this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nJoe Rogan, a prominent UFC commentator, has publicly announced he will not be attending UFC 315 in Montreal. He cited his discontent with the Canadian government as the reason, stating he 'doesn't go to Canada anymore' and would 'rather go to Russia.' Rogan also mentioned that he had discussed US-Canada relations with Donald Trump, who had joked about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.\n\nToday is 2025-04-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
