    "review": "The other forecasters provide thoughtful analyses centered on bureaucratic inertia and the short timeline, which are valid considerations. However, their reasoning appears to be based on an anachronistic understanding of the situation. Forecaster 3 explicitly references a 'scrivener's error' from 2018 and dismisses the research assistant's report on the new April 2025 policy. Forecaster 2's analysis, while acknowledging a new policy, seems to conflate its reversal with correcting an unintended consequence. Neither fully grapples with the core information from the research report: the 50% tariff is the result of a deliberate, new, and recently implemented 'reciprocal tariffs' policy from which Lesotho was explicitly not exempted. Their arguments about the difficulty of changing the status quo are correct, but they underestimate the difficulty because reversing a deliberate policy is far harder than correcting a clerical error.",
    "rationale": "I am not changing my forecast. My initial analysis was based squarely on the provided research assistant's report, which states the 50% tariff is a result of a new, formula-based 'reciprocal tariffs' policy implemented on April 9, 2025. The report also provides a critical piece of evidence that the other forecasters overlooked: the administration granted a 90-day pause to some countries but specifically excluded Lesotho. This is a strong signal of intent, framing the tariff as a deliberate policy choice, not an accident or a lingering error. Correcting a 'scrivener's error' (as Forecaster 3 believes) is an administrative task; reversing a newly-enacted, deliberate policy is a political act that requires a significant change of course. Given the extremely short timeframe until June 1, 2025, and this explicit signal of intent, the probability of a reversal is very low. The other forecasters' arguments about institutional inertia and the low priority of Lesotho for the U.S. actually reinforce my position when applied to the correct context of a deliberate policy. Therefore, my initial forecast of 90% remains the most logical conclusion based on the evidence provided.",
