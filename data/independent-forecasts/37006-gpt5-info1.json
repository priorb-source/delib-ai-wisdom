  "information": "In the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections, the Bloc Québécois won 32 seats in Quebec, while the Conservative Party of Canada won 10 seats in each of those elections. Historically, the Bloc has won more seats in Quebec than the Conservatives in the last five to seven elections.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 months (election expected in late October 2025, likely Oct 20)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the Bloc Québécois wins more Quebec seats than the Conservatives",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A strong Conservative surge among francophone voters lifts CPC vote share across multiple regions (Quebec City CMA, Chaudière-Appalaches, Mauricie, Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean, Centre-du-Québec), while the Bloc slips into the teens/low 20s in vote share as Liberals (potentially under a refreshed leader) peel off soft nationalist voters in suburban Montreal. Bloc seat count falls into the single digits or low teens, while CPC climbs to the mid-teens or higher, surpassing the Bloc in seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Bloc maintains a small but durable lead among francophones and preserves its efficient seat map outside Montreal. CPC gains remain concentrated in the Quebec City region and a handful of adjacent ridings, netting only incremental pickups. Any Liberal recovery primarily hurts the Bloc in popular vote but translates to Liberal wins in the Montreal area, not CPC wins, leaving the Bloc’s seat total still above the CPC. Candidate hiccups for CPC in specific ridings (e.g., Quebec City) further cap their Quebec seat ceiling.",
    "rationale": "Baseline favors the Bloc. In 2019 and 2021, the Bloc won 32 Quebec seats while the Conservatives won 10 each time. The research assistant also notes that in recent cycles the Bloc has repeatedly outpaced the Conservatives in Quebec seats. Quebec’s electoral geography tends to make the Bloc’s vote relatively efficient across francophone ridings, whereas CPC support is more regionally concentrated, which often limits their seat ceiling absent a broad francophone surge.\n\nWorld changes slowly: Without a major realignment, the status quo implies the Bloc continues to edge the Conservatives in Quebec seats. Even with a national Conservative surge, translating that into a Quebec-wide seat plurality over the Bloc typically requires (1) meaningful francophone gains beyond the Quebec City belt and (2) a Bloc slump. A potential Liberal leadership change and resurgence (e.g., a Carney-led bounce) could damage the Bloc, but that scenario mostly converts Bloc seats into Liberal ones around Montreal rather than into Conservative seats. The cited riding-level hiccup for the Conservatives in Quebec City that benefits the Bloc also nudges the balance toward the Bloc holding a seat lead.\n\nWhy not higher than this? Quebec can swing quickly. If Conservatives begin leading or tying the Bloc among francophones provincewide, they could unlock multi-region gains and surpass the Bloc. A strong Liberal resurgence could also compress the Bloc’s seat count enough that even modest CPC gains put them ahead.\n\nWhy not lower? Recent elections show a persistent Bloc seat advantage over the Conservatives, and CPC’s Quebec growth has historically been regionally bounded. The Bloc’s vote efficiency outside Montreal remains a structural edge.\n\nWhat would change my view upward (toward Yes)?\n- Polls showing Bloc maintaining a clear francophone lead and mid- to high-20s seat projections in Quebec.\n- Evidence of CPC candidate or organizational setbacks in key Quebec battlegrounds.\n\nWhat would change my view downward (toward No)?\n- Sustained polling showing CPC at or above the Bloc among francophones and leading the popular vote in Quebec.\n- Seat models projecting CPC > Bloc in Quebec, or Bloc dropping into low-teens seat territory.\n- A strong Liberal revival specifically cannibalizing Bloc vote in suburban francophone ridings coupled with CPC breakthroughs outside Quebec City.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Bloc Québécois win more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Carney’s Surge in Quebec Could Wipe the Sovereigntist Party Off the Map](https://thewalrus.ca/carneys-surge-in-quebec-could-wipe-the-sovereigntist-party-off-the-map/) | [In Quebec City, a Conservative candidate cannot run and the Bloc is benefitting](https://nationalpost.com/news/in-quebec-city-a-conservative-candidate-cannot-run-and-the-bloc-is-benefitting)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Bloc Québécois party wins more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party of Canada in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election). If it wins the same or fewer seats, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections, the Bloc Québécois won 32 seats in Quebec, while the Conservative Party of Canada won 10 seats in each of those elections. Historically, the Bloc has won more seats in Quebec than the Conservatives in the last five to seven elections.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
