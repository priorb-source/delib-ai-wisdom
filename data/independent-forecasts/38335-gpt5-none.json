    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement before July 1, 2025 (resolves No)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "She delays a decision into late summer/fall 2025 or decides not to run, especially given Trump’s endorsement of Byron Donalds and polling showing her trailing. She continues public-facing initiatives without formal candidacy and allows the field to clarify before making any move.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "She announces before the June 30 end-of-quarter fundraising deadline to show early strength, framing the run as a continuation of the DeSantis agenda and a counter to Trump’s bid to clear the field for Donalds.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: With less than a month left and no announcement yet, the default is No. High-profile candidates typically telegraph an announcement with staffing, filings, or event scheduling; absent such signals (and with the research assistant providing no new info), inertia favors no announcement in June.\n- Headwinds: The cited May 9 report indicates Trump endorsed Byron Donalds and a poll shows Donalds leading Casey DeSantis. In Florida GOP politics, Trump’s endorsement is potent and likely deters immediate entry. Jumping in right after that endorsement would be costly unless she intends a full-scale confrontation, which would usually be preceded by visible groundwork.\n- Timing considerations pushing toward Yes: There is a plausible incentive to announce before June 30 to notch a strong first fundraising report and secure donor commitments for the 2026 cycle. Florida’s 2026 gubernatorial timeline makes mid-2025 announcements common, so a late-June launch is feasible.\n- Why not higher: Trump’s endorsement plus recent polling against her reduce the near-term incentive to announce. The lack of clear pre-announcement signals by early June further lowers odds. Time is short.\n- Why not lower: She remains a high-salience potential candidate with name recognition and an existing network via the governor; a strategic pre–end-of-quarter announcement is still possible.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of scheduled launch events, filings with the Florida Division of Elections indicating a formal candidacy, senior staff hires, or donor meetings signaling an imminent announcement.\n- What would move me down: Additional high-profile GOP endorsements consolidating behind Donalds, public statements from Casey DeSantis ruling out a run or emphasizing non-campaign initiatives, or reporting that she will decide later in 2025.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information beyond the poll/endorsement context, which I weigh as negative for an immediate announcement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Casey DeSantis announce her candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Poll: Trump's endorsement boosts Byron Donalds over Casey DeSantis for Florida governor](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/05/09/poll-byron-donalds-surges-past-casey-desantis-with-trump-backing/83412367007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Casey DeSantis announces her candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
