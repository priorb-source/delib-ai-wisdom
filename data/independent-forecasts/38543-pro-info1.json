  "information": "Following a phone call between the two leaders, Donald Trump stated that Xi Jinping had invited him to visit China, an invitation he accepted. Trump also extended a reciprocal invitation for Xi to visit the US. On June 11, 2025, Trump posted on social media that he and Xi had agreed to meet in person, with the date and location to be announced later. The official statement from the Chinese government mentioned that Trump was invited to visit China but did not mention Xi accepting an invitation to visit the US. In March 2025, Trump had announced that Xi would visit Washington in the 'not too distant future,' without specifying a date.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two weeks, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Presidential visits between major powers are logistically complex and are typically planned months, not days, in advance. The status quo is that the necessary arrangements will not be completed within the short timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the public statements of intent, the logistical and security arrangements for a presidential visit to China cannot be finalized and executed before the July 1, 2025 deadline. The respective diplomatic teams agree on a date for the visit in July or later.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by a desire to address an urgent economic or geopolitical issue, both President Trump and President Xi direct their administrations to bypass standard protocols and arrange a summit on an accelerated timeline. An official announcement is made in the coming days for a brief, focused visit to occur in the last week of June.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the extreme logistical difficulty of arranging a presidential visit to China within a two-week timeframe. Today is June 15, 2025, leaving only about 15 days until the deadline. Such visits involve massive security details, complex diplomatic protocols, and extensive advance planning, which is nearly impossible to execute properly on such short notice. The status quo assumption is that bureaucratic and logistical inertia will prevent the visit from happening so quickly.\n\nThe key evidence supporting this is the lack of a confirmed date or location, with the June 11 announcement only stating these details would be 'announced later.' This suggests that concrete planning is still in its nascent stages.\n\nHowever, the probability is not closer to zero because there is clearly strong, high-level political will. The research indicates both Trump and the Chinese government have publicly confirmed an agreement for a visit to take place. President Trump is known for an unconventional approach that can sometimes accelerate timelines. If a sufficiently urgent reason emerged, it is conceivable that a stripped-down summit could be arranged rapidly.\n\nMy forecast would increase significantly upon an official announcement of a specific date before July 1. Conversely, it would decrease if there is any official mention of 'scheduling difficulties' or if a date in July or later is announced.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit China before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFox News: [Trump touts 'very positive' breakthrough with Xi after slamming China for trade violation](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-touts-very-positive-breakthrough-xi-after-slamming-china-trade-violation) | Wikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after this question opens and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits China.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing a phone call between the two leaders, Donald Trump stated that Xi Jinping had invited him to visit China, an invitation he accepted.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
