    "review": "My initial forecast of 80% was too high. I focused correctly on the high likelihood of a >10,000 person protest occurring given the extreme political volatility in South Korea, but I failed to adequately analyze a crucial bottleneck in the resolution criteria identified by Forecaster 2. Forecaster 3's analysis (90%), while correctly assessing the protest environment, appears to misinterpret the resolution criteria by focusing on protests that occurred before this question's launch date. Forecaster 2's analysis (34%) provided the key insight: the Global Protest Tracker (GPT) likely catalogues protest *waves*, not individual rallies. This means a large protest in May 2025 linked to the ongoing political crisis would likely be considered a continuation of the wave that started in late 2024, and thus would not generate a *new entry* with a qualifying start date, leading to a 'No' resolution. This argument is highly persuasive and represents the most significant path to a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am making a significant downward revision to my forecast, from 80% to 45%. The main reason for this change is the compelling argument from Forecaster 2 regarding the GPT's specific methodology. My initial analysis did not properly weigh the high probability that new protests would be categorized as continuations of the existing anti-government movement, which would not trigger a 'Yes' resolution. This insight dramatically increases the probability of 'No'. However, I am remaining higher than Forecaster 2's 34% because I believe there is a substantial, roughly 45%, chance of a new, thematically distinct protest wave emerging that would warrant a new GPT entry. The most likely catalyst is the snap presidential election scheduled for June 3, 2025. Protests surrounding the legitimacy of the election process or its outcome would provide a clear narrative break from the preceding impeachment crisis, making it highly likely that GPT would classify it as a new event. My updated forecast of 45% balances the high likelihood of protests occurring against the specific and restrictive criteria of the resolution source, with the election acting as the key potential trigger for a 'Yes' outcome.",
