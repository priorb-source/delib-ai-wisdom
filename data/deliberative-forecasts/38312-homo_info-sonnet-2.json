    "review": "The other forecasters provide valuable specific information that strengthens the case for a lower probability. Forecaster 2 identifies the summit dates as June 15-17, meaning we have only 12-14 days remaining - even tighter than my 'imminent' characterization. Forecaster 3 raises a crucial point I missed: Sikh organizations in Canada are actively lobbying PM Carney against inviting Modi, adding significant domestic political pressure beyond just diplomatic tensions. Both forecasters also note that Canada has invited multiple non-G7 countries (Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, Brazil) but conspicuously not India, suggesting deliberate exclusion rather than oversight. The convergence of all three forecasts in the 7-12% range is notable and suggests we're honing in on the right probability range.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the specific timeline information is particularly damaging to the Yes case. With only 12-14 days until June 15-17, the logistical impossibility becomes clearer - security advance teams, bilateral meeting preparations, and diplomatic choreography simply cannot be rushed to this degree for a head of state visit. The active Sikh lobbying adds a domestic political cost to Carney that I had underweighted - it's not just about bilateral relations but also Canadian domestic politics. The fact that multiple other non-G7 countries received invitations while India did not suggests this is a considered decision, not an administrative delay. However, I'm not going as low as 7% because: (1) diplomatic miracles occasionally happen when strategic interests align, (2) other G7 members might pressure Canada to include India given its geopolitical importance, and (3) there remains technical possibility of a last-minute invitation. The new information warrants a modest downward revision.",
