  "information": "As of early May 2025, Republika Srpska (RS) has taken several legislative and political steps. A draft for a new constitution, which includes rights to self-determination and provisions for confederal relationships, completed its public consultation phase in mid-April 2025. The RS government has also passed laws to ban Bosnia's central judicial, police, and intelligence agencies from operating within its territory. Milorad Dodik, the leader of RS, has stated he is willing to declare independence if the central authorities, with international support, attempt to take control of RS property. Similarly, Nenad Stevanović, President of the RS Parliament, warned that continued pressure would lead to a declaration of independence, stating that RS is a functional entity capable of implementing its decisions independently.\n\nInternational reactions to the political situation in Republika Srpska are varied. The U.S. and EU have expressed strong opposition to secession, with a U.S. envoy labeling RS's proposals as \"secession by another name.\" The U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo has warned that disobeying the decisions of Bosnia's Constitutional Court, such as celebrating the banned January 9th holiday, may constitute a criminal offense. In contrast, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković has expressed support for Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership while voicing concern over secessionist rhetoric from RS, warning that delays in EU integration could allow Russia and China to increase their influence. Russia has appeared supportive of moves by RS, and a Russian military documentary film festival was scheduled to take place in Banja Luka in May 2025.\n\nHistorical and legal precedents provide context for a potential referendum. Bosnia's Constitutional Court has ruled on multiple occasions that celebrating Republika Srpska Day on January 9 is unconstitutional. Despite this, RS held a parade for the banned holiday in January 2025. Analysis of other independence movements shows varying timelines: the process for Catalonia's 2017 referendum took approximately 7-8 months from legislative groundwork to the announcement, while Scotland's 2014 referendum process took about 2 years. In contrast, Crimea's 2014 referendum, under Russian influence, was organized in about two weeks. The political structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina is based on the 1995 Dayton Agreement, which divided the country into two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 60 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - No official referendum date is announced. Republika Srpska continues with legislative changes and rhetoric but stops short of formally scheduling a referendum.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite escalating rhetoric and legislative groundwork, Dodik and RS leadership use the threat of referendum as a political negotiating tool but do not actually announce a date before July 1st. Strong international pressure from US and EU, combined with potential sanctions and economic consequences, deter formal announcement. The two-month window proves too short to organize the logistics and political support needed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A specific incident or confrontation with central Bosnian authorities triggers Dodik to follow through on his threats and officially announce a referendum date within the next 60 days. Russian encouragement emboldens the leadership, and they decide a rapid timeline (similar to Crimea's 2-week model) serves their interests. The announcement is made even if the referendum itself is scheduled for after July 1st.",
    "rationale": "The status quo heavily favors No. While RS has taken concrete steps (constitutional draft, laws banning central authorities, defiant January 9th parade), and Dodik has made explicit threats, no referendum date has actually been announced yet with only 60 days remaining. Historical comparison shows most referendums take much longer to organize (Scotland 2 years, Catalonia 7-8 months), though Crimea's rushed 2-week process under Russian influence is an outlier. Key factors weighing against announcement: (1) Very tight 2-month timeframe, (2) Strong US/EU opposition with threatened sanctions, (3) Dodik's historical pattern of using secessionist rhetoric as political leverage without full follow-through, (4) No evidence of actual referendum logistics being prepared. Factors supporting possibility: (1) Concrete legislative steps being taken, (2) Increased boldness shown by January parade defying Constitutional Court, (3) Explicit conditional threats from Dodik linking independence to central authority actions, (4) Russian support providing some backing, (5) Current political moment appears more escalated than previous cycles. The probability is not lower because real groundwork is being laid and boldness is increasing. It's not higher because the timeframe is extremely tight, international opposition is severe, and the gap between rhetoric and actual announcement remains large. I would update upward if referendum preparation committees are announced, specific timelines are stated, or a triggering incident occurs. I would update downward if negotiations begin, time passes without movement, or explicit denials are made.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early May 2025, Republika Srpska (RS) has taken several legislative and political steps.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
