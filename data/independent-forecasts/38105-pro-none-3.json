    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement is reached. Lebanon's political class fails to implement the reforms required by the IMF, continuing the years-long stalemate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Lebanese parliament and government fail to pass the key prior actions demanded by the IMF, such as a comprehensive bank restructuring plan and a capital control law. The deep-seated political divisions and opposition from powerful vested interests prevent any meaningful progress, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an agreement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and severe intensification of the economic crisis, combined with strong international pressure, forces a rare moment of political consensus in Lebanon. The required reforms are rapidly pushed through parliament, satisfying the IMF's conditions and allowing for a formal agreement to be announced just before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the persistent political paralysis that has prevented Lebanon from enacting necessary reforms for years, coupled with the extremely short timeframe of just one month. The status quo in Lebanon is one of political gridlock, where entrenched elites have consistently blocked the reforms required to unlock an IMF deal since a staff-level agreement was first reached in April 2022. These reforms, particularly regarding the restructuring of the banking sector and the allocation of financial losses, are politically explosive and face immense opposition. For a breakthrough to occur in the next month would require a fundamental shift in the political calculus of all major parties, which is a highly improbable event. The positive statements from officials like the finance minister are common but have seldom translated into concrete action. My probability is not lower, near zero, because there is always a small chance that external pressure or an unforeseen domestic shock could force a rapid, last-minute compromise. However, my probability is not higher because the structural impediments to reform are immense and the track record of the Lebanese political establishment overwhelmingly points towards continued inaction. I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of a major political bloc reversing its position and key legislation passing in parliament. Conversely, I would decrease it if major leaders publicly recommitted to blocking the reforms.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the IMF and Lebanon announce an agreement before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lebanon finance minister confident of a new deal with IMF to help crumbling economy](https://www.newarab.com/news/lebanon-finance-minister-confident-new-deal-imf)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Lebanon and the International Monetary Fund announce any economic agreement between the two entities signed after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025. In order to count, it must involve the IMF agreeing to provide money to Lebanon, whether through loans, grants, or any other means.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
