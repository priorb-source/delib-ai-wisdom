    "review": "New and persuasive points from the others: (1) Brazil’s public caution via Celso Amorim in May 2025 and draft agenda language that’s non-committal on enlargement (Forecaster 2) are strong host-signal evidence I hadn’t incorporated, and hosts can effectively park expansion absent unanimity. (2) The absence of credible leaks naming a candidate this close to the summit (Forecaster 3) matters—prior expansions had visible signaling. (3) Kazakhstan’s president reportedly ruling out seeking full membership on May 30 removes a plausible, consensus-friendly option. (4) Several partners (Algeria, Turkey, Vietnam) haven’t even confirmed partner status, which weakens the near-term upgrade pool. I still think Russia/China will push for a ‘win’ and the partner pipeline provides options, but Brazil’s stance plus India’s known caution and the lack of pre-signaling reduce the odds more than I initially allowed.",
    "rationale": "Unanimity plus host discretion and timing dominate. Key updates: Brazil’s explicit preference to “stabilise before admitting more” and non-committal draft agendas signal a consolidation year. India remains the likely brake; the April foreign ministers’ failure to agree on a communiqué underscores coordination frictions. With ~5 weeks left, the absence of credible leaks or convergent public cues suggests no pre-baked deal. The available partner pool has hurdles: some haven’t confirmed partner participation; Kazakhstan’s self-exclusion removes a clean Eurasian candidate; others (Belarus, Cuba, Turkey) are politically sensitive for India/Brazil. A Yes path still exists—e.g., a late bargain around a low-controversy ASEAN or Latin American partner (Malaysia, Thailand, possibly Bolivia)—but we’d usually see preparatory signaling. Given these factors, I revise down from 38% to 22%. I would move up on credible reports of consensus language or a named candidate emerging from sherpa/Parliamentary Forum tracks, or synchronized pro-expansion statements by Brazil and India. I would move down on explicit host/India statements ruling out expansion this year or authoritative agenda reporting excluding membership decisions.",
