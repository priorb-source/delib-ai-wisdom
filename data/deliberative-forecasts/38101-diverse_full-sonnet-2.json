    "review": "The other forecasters raised several important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the tie-resolves-as-No rule is crucial - this effectively raises the bar for Starmer, requiring him to be clearly ahead rather than just matching Ishiba. Forecaster 2's mean reversion argument for Ishiba is compelling: his recovery from 26% (March low) to 32% (late May) suggests stabilization momentum. Both forecasters also better acknowledged the discrepancy between data sources - the early May Morning Consult data (our actual resolution source) showed Starmer ahead 36% vs 29%, while late May reports showed a reversal to 28% vs 32%. This volatility is important and cuts both ways.\n\nHowever, I think Forecaster 2's 45% may be slightly optimistic given that: (1) the most recent data shows Ishiba ahead, (2) the tie-as-No rule structurally favors the current leader, and (3) Starmer faces the risky June 11 spending review. Forecaster 3's 41% seems most well-calibrated, acknowledging both the possibility of reversal given recent volatility and the structural factors favoring No.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast upward from 38% to 41%. My initial forecast underweighted three key factors: (1) The early May Morning Consult data from our actual resolution source showed Starmer clearly ahead just 3-4 weeks ago, demonstrating that a Yes outcome is feasible; (2) The dramatic swings we've already seen (8+ point relative movements in weeks) suggest one month is sufficient time for meaningful changes; (3) Both leaders remain unpopular and vulnerable to events, meaning neither has a stable base.\n\nHowever, I'm not moving all the way to 45% because the structural factors still favor No: the most recent data shows Ishiba with a 4-point advantage; the tie-resolves-as-No rule requires Starmer to be clearly ahead; the June 11 UK spending review and civil service cuts carry significant downside risk; and Ishiba's recovery from his March low suggests stabilization rather than continued decline. My updated 41% reflects moderate odds of a Starmer comeback while acknowledging that current momentum and the resolution rule favor Ishiba.",
