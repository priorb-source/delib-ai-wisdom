  "information": "The legal process to ban a political party in Germany requires an application to be submitted to the Federal Constitutional Court by the federal government, the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat. The court must then rule that the party aims to undermine the democratic order. Historically, only two parties have been banned in post-WWII Germany: the Socialist Reich Party (SRP) in 1952 and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1956. A 2017 attempt to ban the far-right NPD party failed. As of early May 2025, no formal application to ban the AfD had been filed with the Constitutional Court. Separately, Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV) has classified the AfD as a 'proven right-wing extremist organization,' which permits state surveillance.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No – no ban is officially announced by an authorized German body before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Debate continues and perhaps an application is prepared or even filed, but the Federal Constitutional Court does not issue a ban decision by July 1, 2025 (typical timelines are many months to years).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unprecedented fast-track: an application is filed immediately and the Federal Constitutional Court issues either an extraordinary interim order that effectively bans the AfD pending judgment or an accelerated final decision before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Process and authority: Under Germany’s Basic Law, only the Federal Constitutional Court can ban a political party, and only after an application by the federal government, Bundestag, or Bundesrat. Interior ministries or intelligence services cannot ban a party. \n- Status as of May 2, 2025: According to the research assistant, no formal application to ban the AfD has been filed. The Bundestag has debated the idea (Le Monde reports a cross-party motion by 124 MPs), but debate is far from a filed, consensus-backed petition. The BfV’s harsh classification of the AfD enables surveillance but is not a ban.\n- Historical baselines: Party bans are extraordinarily rare (SRP in 1952, KPD in 1956). The 2017 NPD case shows how high the bar is and how long such cases take; the Court declined to ban even while deeming the party unconstitutional in aims, citing lack of capacity to undermine the democratic order. \n- Timing: Even if an application were filed immediately, the Court’s evidentiary process and hearings would almost certainly push any decision well beyond July 1, 2025. An interim injunction that amounts to a de facto ban would be unprecedented and would still require a pending case and a severe, immediate harm standard.\nWhy not higher? The legal and procedural constraints plus the very short timeline make a pre–July 1 ban extraordinarily unlikely. \nWhy not lower (i.e., not absolute zero)? In principle, a sudden security crisis tied directly and credibly to the AfD’s organizational leadership, combined with a rapid, cross-institutional consensus and a lightning-fast filing, could prompt the Court to consider extraordinary interim measures. This is highly improbable but not logically impossible. \nWhat would move me upward? A formal, jointly backed application filed immediately by the federal government, Bundestag, or Bundesrat; clear public signals from the Constitutional Court about expedited handling; or a major, acute constitutional-security crisis attributable to the party’s leadership that prompts calls for interim relief. \nWhat would move me downward? Confirmation that no application will be filed this spring; Court statements implying no expedited timetable; or political indications that the governing coalition will pursue alternative measures (e.g., cutting public financing) instead of a ban.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Germany ban the AfD before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nLe Monde: [Germany's Bundestag debates banning far-right AfD party](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/01/31/germany-s-bundestag-debates-banning-far-right-afd-party_6737637_4.html) \"A cross-party group of 124 MPs put a motion on the agenda to bring proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the party, whose unprecedented alliance with the CDU caused a shock.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is an official announcement of a ban on the Alternative for Germany (AfD) by a German government entity with the authority to make such an announcement (e.g., the Federal Constitutional Court).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe legal process to ban a political party in Germany requires an application to be submitted to the Federal Constitutional Court by the federal government, the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
