    "review": "Both forecasters provide critical information I completely missed in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2 claims the 17% tariff is already codified under HTS heading 9903.01.48 with a suspension until July 9, 2025, while Forecaster 3 acknowledges a concrete announcement with that same July 9 date but notes uncertainty about whether it's currently visible on the HTS. The most crucial point both raise is that the resolution criteria explicitly state \"Whether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution\" - meaning if the 17% tariff appears in the HTS marked as suspended, that still resolves YES. This completely changes the dynamics. My initial analysis incorrectly assumed we'd need an active policy change from 10% to 17%. Instead, if a 17% tariff has been announced/codified but suspended until July 9, the question becomes whether it will be LISTED (even as suspended) by June 1. Forecaster 2's logic that inaction leads to YES is compelling if the tariff is already codified. Forecaster 3's caution about posting mechanics and timing is also valid. The specific July 9 suspension date mentioned by both, combined with the Times of Israel article about impacts, suggests something concrete has been announced that I failed to identify.",
    "rationale": "I significantly underestimated this probability due to three key errors: (1) I misunderstood the starting point - there appears to be a concrete 17% tariff announcement with a July 9 suspension, not just speculation about future increases; (2) I failed to properly parse the resolution criteria stating that suspended status doesn't affect the outcome; (3) I didn't recognize that the default path may be YES rather than NO. The evidence suggests a 17% tariff has been formally announced/codified with implementation suspended until July 9, 2025. For YES, the government either maintains this listing or does nothing. For NO, they must actively remove it from the HTS before June 1, which requires completing negotiations and administrative changes within 5 weeks. The tight timeline and bureaucratic processes favor status quo. However, I'm not going as high as Forecaster 2's 90% because: (a) there's factual uncertainty about whether it's currently posted, (b) the US-Israel relationship is strong enough that rapid diplomatic resolution is plausible, and (c) USITC posting timing could vary. I'm above Forecaster 3's 62% because the explicit language that suspended = YES significantly shifts the probability toward a positive resolution.",
