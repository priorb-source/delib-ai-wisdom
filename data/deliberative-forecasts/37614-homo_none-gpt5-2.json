    "review": "Both forecasters add helpful structure. The key additions versus my initial take are: (1) an explicit base rate that local recalls that reach the ballot remove officials roughly ~60% of the time (i.e., ~40% survival), and (2) emphasizing that in a town as tiny as Mountain View, simply qualifying the recall is itself a strong signal of mobilized opposition. They also underline the salience amplification from major local media coverage. I find these points consistent and persuasive; no counter-evidence (like lack of charges formally noted, endorsements, or early ballot data) was provided to offset the negative valence. I agree not to push survival probability too low given small-town idiosyncrasies and potential self-defense/no-charge narratives, but the base-rate framing plus salience justifies shading below 40%.",
    "rationale": "Starting from an approximate 40% survival base rate for local recalls, I adjust downward for the unusually severe allegation (high negative salience) and the signal embedded in a recall qualifying within a very small electorate, which suggests energized opposition likely to dominate a low-turnout special election. Countervailing factors include potential absence of charges, possible self-defense framing, incumbency/name recognition, and the volatility of very small electorates where personal relationships matter. With eight days to go and no concrete indicators (endorsements, early ballot returns, visible organizational advantages for Metz) to counterbalance, I modestly decrease my estimate from 40% to 38% rather than making a larger move. A meaningful update before Election Day would require new reporting (charges filed or, conversely, prosecutors declining to charge with clear exculpatory detail), visible elite endorsements, or early turnout data signaling broader-than-expected participation beyond the recall proponents.",
