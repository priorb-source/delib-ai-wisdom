  "information": "On May 13, 2025, Mali's military junta, led by General Assimi Goïta, issued a presidential decree dissolving all political parties and organizations. The government justified the decision by citing the need to rationalize the political landscape, which includes around 300 parties, and to preserve national unity and stability. The decree followed national consultations held in April 2025. Preceding the decree, the National Transitional Council (CNT) voted 130-2 to repeal the law governing the charter of political parties and the statute of political opposition. The government has stated its intention to draft a new legislative framework to regulate the political sector in the future.\n\nIn response to the dissolution decree, Malian political parties have initiated legal challenges, filing lawsuits in six courts in Bamako and a separate appeal to the administrative section of the Supreme Court. They argue the decree infringes on their rights to association, assembly, and participation in public life. On May 3, 2025, prior to the decree, hundreds of people attended a protest in Bamako organized by the parties. Following the decree, Malian intellectuals, including writers and lawyers, signed a statement denouncing the regime's actions. Reports indicate at least three opposition members have been arrested.\n\nThe international community has widely condemned the dissolution of political parties in Mali. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, publicly called on the Malian authorities to reverse the decision. Both Amnesty International and the United Nations have characterized the junta's actions as an attack on freedom of expression and association. The African Union (AU) has been called upon to mediate and support dialogue to restore democratic processes, in line with the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance. This international pressure comes after Mali previously announced its withdrawal from the regional bloc ECOWAS.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Malian junta ignores international condemnation and domestic legal challenges. The Supreme Court either rules in the government's favor, indefinitely delays its ruling, or is ignored by the junta. Protests remain small-scale and are effectively suppressed. The ban on political parties remains in effect as the government proceeds with its plan to create a new political framework on its own timeline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A combination of factors rapidly escalates pressure on the junta, forcing a tactical reversal. This could involve a surprise ruling by the Supreme Court that the junta feels compelled to respect to maintain some legitimacy, coupled with widespread civil unrest that threatens the stability of the regime, and the imposition of sudden, severe sanctions by key international partners.",
    "rationale": "The probability of the Malian government reversing its decision to dissolve political parties before July 1, 2025, is very low. The primary reason is the short timeframe; major policy reversals by authoritarian regimes rarely occur within weeks. The dissolution appears to be a deliberate and strategic step to consolidate power, not a rash decision. This is evidenced by the preceding vote in the National Transitional Council and the government's stated intention to draft a new legislative framework, which suggests a long-term plan rather than a temporary measure. The junta has demonstrated its willingness to suppress dissent through arrests and has a track record of defying international pressure, notably by withdrawing from ECOWAS. While domestic legal challenges and international condemnation create pressure, they are unlikely to be sufficient to force a reversal so quickly. The status quo, where the decree remains in force, is the most probable outcome.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 5% because there remains a small but non-zero chance that the legal challenges filed with the Supreme Court could succeed and that the junta, for internal reasons, might choose to abide by the ruling to avoid escalating the crisis. A rapid and unexpectedly large mobilization of popular protest could also change their calculation. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the junta's actions are consistent with authoritarian consolidation. They are actively suppressing opposition and have insulated themselves from regional diplomatic pressure. Reversing course would be a significant sign of weakness, which the regime is unlikely to display willingly in such a short period. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of a major split within the ruling junta, if protests grew exponentially to a scale that threatened government control in Bamako, or if a key partner like Russia or China unexpectedly joined the international calls for reversal with tangible threats.",
