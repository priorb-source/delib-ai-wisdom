  "information": "The Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) has been the leading party in every Viennese state election since 1945.\n\nPublic polls from outlets such as ElectsWorld and ORF ahead of the April 27, 2025, election consistently showed the SPÖ with 38-40% of the vote, compared to the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) with 21-24%, indicating a lead of 16-19 percentage points.\n\nThe SPÖ is the incumbent party governing Vienna and is noted to have a well-established and entrenched local party organization.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "6 days until the election on April 27, 2025, with results expected shortly thereafter",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The SPÖ wins the most seats, continuing their unbroken string of victories in Vienna since 1945",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Another party, most likely the FPÖ, surpasses the SPÖ in seats. This would require an unprecedented polling error of 16-19 percentage points or a dramatic last-minute collapse in SPÖ support due to a major scandal or crisis emerging in the final days before voting.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The SPÖ maintains their polling lead and wins the plurality of seats as all current indicators suggest. They perform at or near their poll numbers of 38-40%, comfortably ahead of the FPÖ's 21-24%, continuing their 80-year dominance in Vienna.",
    "rationale": "The evidence overwhelmingly favors the SPÖ winning the most seats. My research assistant's report highlights three critical factors: (1) unbroken historical dominance since 1945, (2) consistent polling showing a commanding 16-19 point lead over the nearest competitor with just 6 days remaining, and (3) strong incumbent status with an entrenched local organization. Multiple independent sources (ElectsWorld, ORF, IFDD) confirm this substantial lead. Polling errors large enough to overcome such a margin are extremely rare, especially this close to election day. The SPÖ would need to underperform polls by roughly 10+ points while the FPÖ overperforms by a similar amount - a combined swing of 20+ points, which is virtually unprecedented in stable democracies. I'm not forecasting 100% because elections always carry some irreducible uncertainty: unforeseen late-breaking scandals, systematic polling failures, or black swan events could theoretically occur. However, I'm not forecasting lower because the evidence is exceptionally strong across multiple dimensions. To update higher, I would need to see the actual election results confirming the SPÖ victory. To update lower, I would need evidence of late polls showing dramatic narrowing, reports of major scandals affecting the SPÖ, or credible analysis suggesting systematic polling bias.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
