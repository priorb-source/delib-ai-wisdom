    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the CDC’s strong precedent of keeping yellow fever at Level 2 even during much larger outbreaks (notably Brazil 2017–18) and the need for sustained urban transmission or unmitigable risk to justify Level 3. They also stress the short time window and policy-update latency. Forecaster 3 adds a useful point about the compressed timeline for confirmation and CDC action given incubation and reporting lags. Neither introduced materially new evidence beyond precedent and current epidemiology, but citing Nigeria 2019 as another precedent bolsters the base-rate argument. One gap they did not discuss is whether another disease could drive a Level 3 for Colombia; however, that pathway seems even less likely than yellow fever given CDC norms (dengue/measles/polio rarely prompt Level 3). Overall, their reasoning is consistent and slightly strengthens the case for a small downward nudge.",
    "rationale": "My prior was 6%, driven by the low but non-zero chance of sudden urban transmission, major vaccine access issues, or a CDC posture change. The other analyses reinforce that: (1) the CDC has not used Level 3 for yellow fever even in far larger events; (2) current cases are rural with no verified urban transmission; (3) vaccination is available and being scaled; and (4) the remaining time window is short for both epidemiologic escalation and CDC action. Considering also that alternative disease triggers for Level 3 are unlikely, I trim my forecast to 5% to reflect the strong precedent and timing constraints while preserving a small tail for rapid, adverse developments. I would update upward only with credible reports of sustained urban transmission in a major city, significant traveler/exported cases, or systemic vaccine/hospital strain prompting PAHO/CDC concern.",
