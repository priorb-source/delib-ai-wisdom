  "information": "The Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which aims to ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program. The bill, authored by Senator Charles Perry and supported by Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, passed the Senate on May 7, 2025, with a 25-6 vote and was sent to the House State Affairs Committee. Proponents cite concerns over public health and safety regarding unregulated high-THC products. Lt. Gov. Patrick has stated he will push for a special legislative session if a ban is not passed during the regular session. The proposed law would make possession of consumable hemp products punishable by up to one year in jail and a $4,000 fine.\n\nThe Texas House of Representatives has shown resistance to a full THC ban, instead advancing measures to expand medical cannabis access. House Bill 46 (HB 46), which broadens the state's Compassionate Use Program, was approved by the House with a vote of 118-16. This bill expands the list of qualifying medical conditions, increases the number of licensed dispensaries to 11, and gives military veterans special access to low-dose THC treatments. Furthermore, a House committee adopted a substitute version of the Senate's SB 3 that is not a full ban, but would allow certain low-THC beverages and tinctures while prohibiting vapes and synthetics. The Texas hemp industry, estimated to be worth $8 billion, and Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller have expressed concerns that a total ban would shutter thousands of businesses.\n\nThe Texas Legislature's regular session is scheduled to end on May 26, 2025, leaving a narrow window for new legislation to pass through all required procedural steps in both chambers and be signed by the governor. While Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick has threatened to force a special session, only Governor Greg Abbott can officially call one and set its agenda. As of mid-May, Governor Abbott's stated public priorities for the session did not include a THC ban. Public opinion appears to favor more access; a University of Houston survey found that 62% of Texans support marijuana legalization and 79% support a comprehensive medical marijuana program. Veterans' groups have also testified in opposition to a ban, citing THC products as an alternative to opioids.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025. The Texas Legislature's regular session ends May 26, 2025, which is only 12 days away.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - No full THC ban is currently law in Texas, and the legislative chambers are at odds with the Senate favoring a full ban while the House has created a substitute version that is explicitly NOT a full ban.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The regular legislative session ends on May 26 without the House and Senate reconciling their differences on SB 3. The House substitute version (allowing low-THC beverages/tinctures while prohibiting vapes and synthetics) does not constitute a full ban. Governor Abbott does not call a special session before July 1, or if he does, legislators cannot agree on a full ban given the House's demonstrated preference for expanding medical access rather than imposing prohibition.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The House reverses course in the remaining 12 days and passes the Senate's full ban version of SB 3, Governor Abbott signs it quickly, or alternatively, Governor Abbott calls a special session between May 26 and July 1, 2025, and both chambers pass identical full ban legislation that the governor signs into law.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. While the Senate passed SB 3 with a strong 25-6 vote on May 7, the House has already demonstrated clear resistance by: (1) passing HB 46 to expand medical cannabis access 118-16, and (2) creating a substitute version of SB 3 that is explicitly not a full ban. With only 12 days remaining in the regular session, reconciling these divergent positions through normal legislative procedures appears highly unlikely.\n\nKey factors weighing against a Yes outcome: The $8 billion hemp industry opposition, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller's concerns, strong public support for legalization (62%) and medical marijuana (79%), veterans' groups opposing the ban, and most critically, Governor Abbott has not made this a stated priority. Even Lieutenant Governor Patrick's threat of a special session requires Abbott to call one and set the agenda.\n\nFor a Yes outcome to occur, either: (1) the House must dramatically reverse its position in 12 days and pass the full Senate ban, or (2) Abbott must call a special session in the 5-week window after May 26 and both chambers must pass a full ban. The first scenario contradicts the House's demonstrated preferences, and the second requires Abbott to prioritize an issue he hasn't emphasized.\n\nI'm not forecasting lower (5-10%) because: legislative surprises do happen, the Senate showed strong support, Patrick is highly motivated, and a special session remains technically possible. I'm not forecasting higher (30-40%) because: the House has definitively shown its position, time is extremely limited, the governor hasn't prioritized this, strong opposition exists from multiple powerful constituencies, and public opinion runs counter to a ban. The procedural complexity of reconciling chamber differences in 12 days is substantial.\n\nTo update higher, I would need: evidence Abbott is prioritizing this issue, House members signaling willingness to accept the full ban, or concrete plans for a special session. To update lower: the regular session ending without passage, or Abbott publicly stating he won't call a special session on this matter.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which aims to ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
