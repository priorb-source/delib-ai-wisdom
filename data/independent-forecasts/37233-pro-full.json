  "information": "In a January 2025 address to the diplomatic corps, President Alassane Ouattara stated he was in 'perfect health and ready to continue serving my country', but clarified that he had 'not yet made a decision' regarding a candidacy in the October 2025 presidential election. He noted that his party, the RHDP, has at least a dozen potential candidates. Previously, in 2020, Ouattara had announced his intention to step down but reversed this decision to run for a third term after the sudden death of his designated successor.\n\nPresident Ouattara's party, the RHDP, has referred to him as its 'natural candidate' and has been calling for him to run since 2024. In late December 2024, Minister of State Anne Désirée Ouloto announced Ouattara would be the candidate. Similarly, in early January 2025, Minister of Transport Amadou KONÉ stated that Ouattara 'will be the candidate of the RHDP in October 2025.' In late April 2025, a supporter group, the Jeunesse pour la Renaissance du Grand Nord (JRGN), held a press conference publicly calling on Ouattara to run.\n\nSeveral key opposition figures face eligibility challenges ahead of the 2025 election. In late April 2025, a court ruled that potential challenger Tidjane Thiam, leader of the PDCI party, was ineligible to run for president due to his French nationality. Former President Laurent Gbagbo was excluded from electoral lists in 2023 following a conviction for embezzlement. Another political figure, Guillaume Soro, remains in exile and is ineligible due to a 2021 conviction; in April 2025, a trial began for his former aide-de-camp for an alleged coup attempt against Ouattara.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with the resolution deadline being June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "President Alassane Ouattara has not officially declared his candidacy for the 2025 presidential election. If the current situation persists until the deadline, the outcome will be No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "President Ouattara continues his strategy of ambiguity, choosing to delay his official announcement until after June 1, 2025. He may wait for a large RHDP party congress in the summer to formally accept the nomination, thereby maximizing media impact and maintaining strategic control over the political timeline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Responding to sustained and public pressure from his RHDP party, which has already named him its 'natural candidate', President Ouattara decides to formalize his candidacy to unify his supporters and project strength. He makes a formal declaration in a televised address or at a party event during May 2025.",
    "rationale": "The current status quo is that President Ouattara has not declared his candidacy. However, there is immense and coordinated pressure from his ruling party, the RHDP, for him to run. Multiple high-ranking ministers have publicly stated that he 'will be the candidate,' effectively pre-announcing his run. This concerted effort suggests that the internal decision has likely been made and they are preparing the political ground for an official announcement. Ouattara's own statement about being in 'perfect health and ready to continue serving' is a strong signal of his intent, despite his official indecision. The key uncertainty is the timing. While a strategic delay past June 1st is possible, the momentum created by his party makes an announcement in the near future—within the next month—highly probable. The primary reason my forecast is not higher is the strategic advantage of ambiguity; Ouattara may prefer to wait until a summer party congress for a more dramatic announcement, keeping opponents guessing and internal rivals in check for a little longer. The forecast is not lower because the public statements from his top ministers are a very strong and credible signal of his intentions, making a near-term announcement more likely than not. I would increase my probability if the RHDP schedules a major party rally for May. I would decrease it if Ouattara or his office explicitly states that a decision will be announced at a later date, such as in July or August.",
