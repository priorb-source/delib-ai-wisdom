    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my priors: short time window (~26 days), lack of pre-launch signals, weak polling (~5%), and Donalds’ Trump endorsement all point to a lower near-term hazard rate. The most useful added nuance is the Miami City Commission’s possible election shift extending Suarez’s term, raising resign-to-run and timing considerations that likely discourage a June announcement until that uncertainty is resolved. I also find their Q2 vs. clean Q3 fundraising tradeoff framing helpful; it cuts both ways but, absent ramp-up signals, slightly favors delay. Overall, their arguments modestly strengthen the case for a small downward adjustment.",
    "rationale": "Key factors:\n- Timing: We are inside the historical 12–18 month announcement window, so a June launch is plausible but not necessary.\n- Signals: No leaks, filings, staffing, or event prep reported—unusual this close to month-end for a serious statewide rollout.\n- Competitive landscape: Donalds is in with Trump’s endorsement; potential entries by others cloud Suarez’s lane and reduce donor urgency.\n- Local considerations: Potential extension of Miami’s 2025 election to 2026 introduces resign-to-run/timing complexities, which likely nudge against a June decision pending clarity.\n- Countervailing possibility: Suarez could execute a fast, media-forward announcement to close Q2 strong; a simple public statement would satisfy resolution.\nNet: With only a few weeks left and no visible groundwork, the base case remains No before July 1. The added municipal timing uncertainty marginally lowers the near-term likelihood. I’m trimming my estimate slightly from 23% to 21% to reflect these frictions while preserving some weight on a late-breaking announcement.\nSignals that would move me up: credible launch-date reporting, committee filings, staff/vendor hires, donor outreach leaks, or Suarez indicating a June decision timeline. Down: consolidation behind Donalds, city term extension finalized without Suarez movement, or hints he’ll decide later in summer/fall.",
