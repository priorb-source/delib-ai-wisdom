  "information": "United Airlines has announced a new year-round, twice-weekly direct flight from Narita, Japan, to Koror, Palau, which will commence on October 29, 2025. The route will be operated by a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, and tickets are already available for purchase. Separately, in February 2025, Qantas launched a new direct route from Brisbane to Koror, named the 'Palau Paradise Express.' This service is supported by the Australian Government.\n\nAs of early 2024, there were four to five regularly scheduled direct flight destinations from Koror, including Guam (operated by United Airlines), Manila (United Airlines), Taipei (China Airlines), and Brisbane (Qantas). In addition to scheduled services, Japan Airlines (JAL) resumed direct charter flights from Narita to Palau in March 2025 after a five-year suspension.\n\nTourism in Palau is in a recovery phase. Visitor numbers from Europe reached 3,442 by December 2024, approaching pre-pandemic levels. The Palau Visitors Authority is promoting the destination by leveraging increased flight frequency with partners like China Airlines. Hong Kong Airlines also lists Koror as a destination within its network. Prior to the pandemic, several South Korean airlines, including Air Seoul and T'way, operated services to Palau. A previous service between Narita and Koror operated by Delta Air Lines was suspended in May 2018.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The number of direct flight destinations remains at the current four (Guam, Manila, Taipei, Brisbane), or potentially increases to five if one new route is added. In either case, the total is not greater than 5, and the question resolves as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least two new airlines launch scheduled, direct routes to Koror before July 1, 2025. For example, Hong Kong Airlines begins a service from Hong Kong and a South Korean carrier unexpectedly resumes its pre-pandemic flights from Seoul, bringing the total number of destinations to six or more.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the current number of scheduled direct flights from Koror and the operational realities of the airline industry. As of May 2025, there are four confirmed scheduled direct destinations: Guam (United), Manila (United), Taipei (China Airlines), and Brisbane (Qantas). The question requires a total greater than five, meaning six or more destinations, by July 1, 2025.\n\nThis would require at least two new scheduled routes to be launched and operational within the next six weeks. This is a very short timeframe. Establishing new international routes involves complex logistics, regulatory approvals, and marketing campaigns that are typically planned and announced many months in advance. The world generally changes slowly, and the aviation market is a prime example of this.\n\nWhile there are positive signs for Palauan tourism, the available evidence does not support such a rapid expansion. United Airlines' new route from Narita, Japan, will not commence until October 2025, well after the resolution date. Japan Airlines' service from Narita is currently on a charter basis, which is distinct from a regularly scheduled service and unlikely to be counted by the resolution source. While Hong Kong Airlines lists Koror in its network, which is a positive indicator, it has not announced a scheduled service with a start date before July 1. Even if this single route were to launch, it would only bring the total to five, which would not trigger a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because there is a small, non-zero chance of surprise announcements, potentially driven by government subsidies or a strategic push to accelerate tourism recovery. However, my probability is not higher because the addition of two distinct routes from separate carriers in such a constrained timeframe is highly improbable. For me to increase my forecast, there would need to be official announcements from at least two airlines in the immediate future confirming new scheduled services to Koror commencing before July 1, 2025.",
