    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus, with all three forecasters arriving at the same initial probability of 15% based on similar core reasoning. The primary arguments across the board are the powerful inertia of the status quo: India's diplomatic reluctance to extradite a former allied leader, and the severe legal jeopardy Sheikh Hasina would face, making a voluntary return highly improbable within the short timeframe. Forecaster 2 added a useful nuance by highlighting that the imminent submission of the ICT's probe report will formalize the charges and increase diplomatic pressure on India, acting as a potential catalyst. Forecaster 3 provided the most compelling new argument by reframing Khaleda Zia's return not as a pressure point that might force Hasina to act, but as an event that solidifies the anti-Hasina political forces, thereby making a return even more dangerous and thus less likely. This counter-perspective on a key variable is particularly valuable.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 15%. After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am making a small downward adjustment. The core logic of my original forecast remains intact: the combination of diplomatic inertia and extreme personal risk for Sheikh Hasina makes her return before July 1 highly unlikely. The other forecasters strongly reinforced this view. However, I found Forecaster 3's argument regarding the impact of Khaleda Zia's return to be particularly persuasive. I had initially viewed Zia's return as a factor that could increase pressure on Hasina to make a move to maintain her political relevance. Forecaster 3 convincingly argued the opposite: that Zia's return consolidates the opposition, increases the physical and political danger for Hasina, and therefore makes a voluntary return a less rational, and thus less likely, option. This significantly weakens what I saw as the most plausible, albeit still unlikely, scenario for a 'Yes' resolution. While the extradition scenario remains a possibility, the timeline makes it improbable. By reducing the likelihood of a voluntary return, my overall probability for a 'Yes' outcome must decrease. I am therefore lowering my forecast slightly to reflect this refined understanding of the political calculus.",
