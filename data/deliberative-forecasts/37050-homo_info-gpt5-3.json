    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my initial view: short window, no clear catalysts, and committees tend to avoid unnecessary churn. Forecaster 3’s main addition is a cleaner base-rate calculation (≈0.7 changes/year over the last decade, implying ~12% over the ~0.18-year window). I agree with the method and that single-day price swings aren’t typical triggers. Forecaster 2’s framing around sector representation and plausible, but currently untriggered, removal candidates (Boeing, 3M, Verizon) matches my prior thinking. Neither added concrete, near-term catalysts or credible reporting that would materially raise odds, but F3’s more accurate base-rate tally suggests my 8% may have been a bit low.",
    "rationale": "The key drivers remain: (1) very short time horizon (~2 months), (2) recent 2024 refreshes reducing urgency, (3) lack of credible rumors or impending corporate actions among constituents that usually precipitate changes, and (4) sector balance currently acceptable. A pure base-rate Poisson using ~0.7 changes/year gives ~12%. I shade that down modestly for recency-of-change and absence of triggers, but up slightly from my prior 8% to reflect the better-calibrated base rate. Upside risks: a surprise corporate action (spin/merger/distress) at Boeing/3M/Verizon/Disney or a representation decision to add a name like Alphabet. Downside: time passes without chatter; explicit stability signals from S&P DJI. Net: low but non-trivial odds.",
