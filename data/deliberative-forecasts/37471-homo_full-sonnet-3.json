    "review": "All three forecasters arrived at identical 12% forecasts through remarkably parallel reasoning. This consensus is notable and generally reassuring - we all identified the same key factors: the 503k March baseline, the required 8x acceleration from the 3k monthly growth rate, declining housing starts/permits, healthy sales absorption, weak builder confidence, and the historical rarity of 550k+ levels. No forecaster raised substantively new evidence or arguments that others hadn't considered. This alignment suggests the analysis is robust rather than reflecting groupthink, as the directional indicators are genuinely clear and consistent. The critical question is whether we're all underweighting certain tail risks. Potential concerns include: (1) seasonal spring/summer inventory builds that could be stronger than the recent trend suggests, (2) a completion surge from projects started 6-12 months ago hitting the market simultaneously, (3) lagged effects from the April mortgage rate increase to 6.83% that could freeze demand in May, or (4) data revisions to March figures. However, these scenarios remain speculative without supporting evidence. The supply-side constraints (collapsing starts and declining permits) provide strong structural barriers to rapid inventory acceleration, while the healthy 724k sales rate actively works against inventory accumulation.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find the consensus reasoning compelling and see no material new information that would warrant changing my forecast. The core logic remains sound: reaching 550k requires an extreme 8x acceleration in inventory growth over just two months, while all fundamental indicators point toward deceleration rather than acceleration. The declining housing starts (-14.2%) and building permits (-2%) create a structural supply constraint that makes rapid inventory accumulation mechanically difficult. Meanwhile, the healthy sales environment (724k annual rate, up 6% YoY) continues to absorb new inventory as it comes to market. The 12% probability appropriately captures tail risk scenarios - such as an unexpected economic shock freezing buyer activity while completions continue, or unusually strong seasonal effects - while recognizing that the base case strongly favors falling short of 550k. The historical context reinforces this: 550k was only exceeded during the 2006-2007 bubble peak, representing an extreme outlier. While the current 503k level is elevated and within 9.3% of the threshold, percentage proximity alone doesn't overcome the unfavorable trajectory and fundamentals. I remain at 12%.",
