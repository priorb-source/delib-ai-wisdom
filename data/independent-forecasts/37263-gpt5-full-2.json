  "information": "In April 2025, the Ministry of Tourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) warned tourism stakeholders against promoting or facilitating the use of illegal taxis, with businesses facing a $1000 fine for such referrals. The government has emphasized that operating an unlicensed taxi is a serious offense, with penalties for drivers including a fine and disqualification from driving. The country, with a resident population of approximately 45,000, has also implemented a new \"Rate Your Ride\" framework. As of May 2025, two locally-based ride-hailing services are confirmed to be operating: GetMe Ride, which launched in 2019, and Conch Cab, which began service in May 2025.\n\nUber's recent expansion strategy has focused on major international markets and technological partnerships. In December 2024, the company launched an \"Uber Taxi\" service in Curitiba, Brazil, integrating licensed local taxi drivers onto its platform through a partnership with mobility company Stuo. In the U.S., Uber partnered with autonomous vehicle developer May Mobility in May 2025, with plans to deploy self-driving taxis in Arlington, Texas, by late 2025 and expand to other cities in 2026. Reports indicate that Uber's historical pattern in the Caribbean has been to prioritize larger markets over smaller island jurisdictions.\n\nTourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands grew significantly in 2024, with the islands welcoming nearly two million visitors across air and cruise travel. This total represents a 10.66% increase in air arrivals and a 30.48% increase in cruise passengers compared to the previous year. New airline routes have been added to accommodate the demand, including a nonstop American Airlines service from Miami to South Caicos launched in March 2025. Concurrently, the U.S. Department of State maintains a Level 2 \"exercise increased caution\" travel advisory for TCI, first issued in July 2023, citing crime levels and reminding travelers of the islands' strict laws against firearms and ammunition.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "TCI maintains its current stance on unlicensed ride services, relies on licensed taxis and local ride-hailing apps (GetMe Ride, Conch Cab), and Uber does not list Turks and Caicos as an available market on its website by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Uber reaches an agreement to operate using licensed taxis (e.g., Uber Taxi) or otherwise launches a compliant service and updates its website to list Turks and Caicos; credible local/government or major media report service availability before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo: There is no sign today of Uber operating in Turks and Caicos, the government is actively warning against illegal taxis, and two local ride-hailing services are already operating (GetMe Ride since 2019; Conch Cab launched May 2025). Absent clear news, the default is continuation of “no Uber.”\n- Market and regulatory fit: TCI is a small jurisdiction (~45k residents) with strong taxi regulation and recent enforcement signals (fines for illegal taxi referrals). This makes near-term entry harder. Uber’s Caribbean pattern tends to favor larger markets, and its recent expansions (e.g., Uber Taxi in Curitiba; AV pilots in U.S.) don’t suggest a push into small islands by July.\n- Timeline risk: A compliant Uber Taxi model could launch quickly if the government and licensed taxi operators agreed. However, there’s no public indication of such talks, and local apps already meet some tourist demand, reducing urgency.\n- Why not higher: Small market size, recent government enforcement posture, presence of local competitors, lack of any announcement, and only ~60 days left.\n- Why not lower: High tourist volumes create demand; Uber can move fast via taxi-integration if political will shifts. A pre–peak-season rollout is conceivable if a partnership is struck.\n- What would move me up: Official Uber press release or website listing TCI; a Ministry of Tourism statement endorsing an Uber Taxi model; credible reporting of a pilot/partnership with licensed taxi associations. What would move me down: Continued enforcement messaging against ride-hailing, public opposition from taxi bodies, or government endorsement of only local apps without room for Uber.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
