    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identify the central dynamic: the formation of a new government in April 2025 significantly lowered the odds of a snap election by removing the constitutional trigger. We are all in a similar probability range, differing only on the interpretation of secondary factors. Forecaster 2's point about President Vučić's history of strategic elections is a valid reason why the probability is not zero. However, Forecaster 3 introduced a crucial and highly convincing new argument that I had not sufficiently weighed: the practical timing mechanics. An announcement before July 1 would, due to the 45-60 day legal requirement, schedule the election for the late summer (July/August), a historically unattractive and logistically difficult period. This structural constraint makes an announcement *within the specific timeframe of the question* much less likely, even if the president is considering an election for later in the year.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 15% was based on the new government's formation creating a strong status quo, while leaving room for President Vučić's tactical unpredictability. After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast. The most decisive new argument came from Forecaster 3 regarding the timing mechanics. An official announcement of an election date must, by law, be followed by a 45-60 day campaign period. An announcement before July 1, 2025, would therefore place the election date in late July or August. This is a highly undesirable period for an election in Serbia due to summer holidays, which would likely depress turnout and engagement. While Vučić is known for opportunistic election calls, scheduling one for deep summer seems strategically unsound. This practical constraint provides a strong reason for him to delay any potential announcement until after July 1, even if he intends to hold an election in the autumn. This new consideration makes me more confident in the 'No' outcome for this specific timeframe. I am therefore lowering my forecast from 15% to 12%, aligning with Forecaster 3's more granular analysis of the timeline.",
