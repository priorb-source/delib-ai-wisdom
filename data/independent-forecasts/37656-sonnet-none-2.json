    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days (from May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the objective remains marked as 'in progress' past the July 1, 2025 deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Federal funding for NPR and PBS continues through appropriations or existing budgets, or any defunding efforts remain incomplete or legally challenged. The spreadsheet maintainers keep the status as 'in progress' because funding has not been fully stopped or the process is still underway when they check on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Congress passes and the President signs legislation eliminating federal funding for NPR/PBS, or successful executive action stops the funding, and this action is deemed sufficiently complete that the Keep_Track project maintainers update the spreadsheet to mark this objective as 'complete' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires two things to happen in 46 days: (1) actual policy action to stop NPR/PBS funding, and (2) the spreadsheet maintainers updating the status to 'complete.' The status quo strongly favors No since the objective is currently 'in progress.' \n\nKey considerations weighing against Yes: Congressional action typically takes longer than 6 weeks, especially for controversial funding cuts. Even if executive action is taken, it would likely face legal challenges, and maintainers might wait to see if cuts actually take effect before marking as complete. The maintainers appear to use conservative criteria (marked 'in progress' suggests they need concrete completion).\n\nKey considerations supporting Yes: The objective being 'in progress' indicates some movement. If there's unified government control and political will, fast-tracked legislation or executive action is possible within this timeframe. Corporation for Public Broadcasting funding appropriations could theoretically be cut through budget reconciliation or executive means.\n\nWhy not lower (below 15%): Six weeks provides sufficient time for executive orders or fast-tracked congressional action if it's truly a priority. The 'in progress' designation suggests active work toward this goal.\n\nWhy not higher (above 35%): Status quo bias heavily favors things remaining unchanged. Complete defunding requires overcoming institutional resistance, and most major policy changes take longer than 6 weeks to implement and recognize as 'complete.' The spreadsheet maintainers must also judge it complete, not just initiated.\n\nTo update higher: Evidence of imminent floor votes on defunding legislation, concrete executive orders already drafted, or reports of appropriations being actively zeroed out. To update lower: Congressional calendar showing no movement on relevant legislation, or public statements that this isn't an immediate priority.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"stop funding for NPR and PBS\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
