    "review": "Both forecasters’ takes align closely with mine: short horizon inertia favors current leaders (lean No), but LA’s top-tier true talent and proximity keep their single-team odds materially above most peers. They surfaced two salient points I also considered: (1) multiple plausible contenders (Phillies/Yankees/Orioles/Tigers/Mets/Braves) dilute any one team’s share; (2) ties at the top likely count as Yes per the wording/standings page, which adds a few points. Neither added concrete new data (schedule strength, updated injuries, current exact gap) that would materially shift my estimate. I find their reasoning sound and broadly consistent with my prior view.",
    "rationale": "My baseline remains that LA is not currently atop MLB and faces multiple near-peers over a ~4-week window, with rotation health capping near-term upside. Countervailing, their underlying strength (preseason projections and elite offense) makes them one of the most likely single teams to be at or tied for the top by June 15. With no new information about schedule softness, rival injuries, or a fresh LA streak, I don’t see a reason to move meaningfully. If ties did not count, I’d trim a few points; assuming ties count, I hold steady.",
