    "review": "The forecasters present compelling but divergent perspectives. Forecaster 2 (35%) and I (45%) emphasized the El Niño to neutral/La Niña transition as a significant headwind. Forecaster 3 (75%) raises crucial points I initially underweighted: (1) the persistence of exceptionally high sea-surface temperatures into spring 2025, (2) lagged effects from the strong 2023-24 El Niño that typically keep temperatures elevated through late spring, and (3) the enormous thermal inertia of ocean heat. These are valid climatological considerations.\n\nHowever, I find Forecaster 3's 75% probability overconfident for several reasons: First, if May 2024 set the previous record during El Niño conditions, surpassing it without that boost requires the underlying warming trend plus residual ocean heat to fully compensate. Second, small methodological differences matter in tight races, as Forecaster 3 acknowledges. Third, while ocean heat persists, the loss of active El Niño forcing is a documented negative factor.\n\nForecaster 2's 35% may be too pessimistic. The points about persistent marine heat and lagged effects suggest the transition away from El Niño may not fully eliminate its influence by May 2025. The underlying warming trend is also exceptionally strong.\n\nThe critical insight is that we're forecasting post-facto (May 2025 already occurred) but without specific temperature data. The absence of dramatic signals in either direction from my research assistant suggests May 2025 was likely close to the record but not obviously exceptional.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast modestly upward from 45% to 52%. Forecaster 3 correctly identified that I underweighted two factors: (1) the persistence of extreme ocean heat into spring 2025, which provides a substantial warming baseline independent of active ENSO forcing, and (2) the lagged thermal effects from the strong El Niño, which don't vanish immediately upon ENSO transition.\n\nHowever, I'm not moving to Forecaster 3's 75% because that level of confidence seems unjustified given: the documented transition away from El Niño conditions, the very high bar set by May 2024 (presumably during more favorable ENSO conditions), uncertainty about how land temperatures performed relative to 2024, and the inherent difficulty of predicting month-to-month records even in a warming world.\n\nMy 52% forecast represents a middle ground that acknowledges the powerful underlying warming trend and ocean heat persistence (supporting higher probability) while respecting the ENSO transition and the challenge of beating a very recent record (limiting probability). This forecast reflects roughly even odds with a slight lean toward 'Yes' based on the thermal inertia arguments.",
