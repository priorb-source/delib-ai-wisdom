  "information": "According to an April 19, 2025, Politico report, Haley Stevens was 'widely expected to declare her Senate candidacy as early as next week.' On the same day, both the Washington Examiner and the Livingston Post reported that Stevens was expected to announce her bid 'in the coming weeks,' a slightly more ambiguous timeframe.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days remain until the May 1, 2025 deadline",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Haley Stevens has not yet announced her candidacy as of today",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Stevens delays her announcement beyond April 30 due to campaign preparation needs, fundraising considerations, or strategic political timing. Alternatively, she decides not to run at all or needs additional time to secure party support and infrastructure",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Stevens follows through on expectations from multiple media reports and announces her Senate candidacy within the next week, likely between April 22-28, which aligns with Politico's timeline of 'as early as next week' from April 19",
    "rationale": "The research assistant provides compelling recent evidence from April 19, 2025 - just two days ago. Politico's specific framing of 'as early as next week' places us directly in the expected announcement window. Multiple credible sources (Politico, Washington Examiner, Livingston Post) independently corroborate expectations of an imminent announcement. This suggests strong signals from Stevens' camp. The context from CNN about Democrats losing other top contenders (Whitmer, Buttigieg, McDonald, Rivet) creates pressure to field a candidate soon. However, I must weight the status quo appropriately: she hasn't announced yet. Political announcements frequently face delays due to fundraising, staffing, strategic considerations, or unexpected developments. With only 10 days remaining, the timeframe is tight. The Washington Examiner's 'coming weeks' language is more ambiguous and could extend beyond May 1. For my forecast to be higher (80-85%), I would need confirmation from Stevens' campaign or more definitive reporting. For it to be lower (50-60%), I would need evidence of complications, competing candidates entering, or Stevens signaling hesitation. The balance of recent, specific reporting against status quo bias and the short remaining timeframe justifies a moderately high probability",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Haley Stevens announce her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [Democrats lose another top contender for US Senate seat in Michigan after Whitmer and Buttigieg bow out](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/politics/michigan-senate-race-democrats-mcdonald-rivet/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Haley Stevens announces her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
