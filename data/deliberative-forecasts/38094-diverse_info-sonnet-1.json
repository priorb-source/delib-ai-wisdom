    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I hadn't fully considered. Most significantly, Forecaster 3 provides concrete behavioral evidence of detachment: Fetterman has left the Democratic caucus group chat and is skipping weekly lunches. This goes beyond general friction to actual withdrawal from caucus activities. Additionally, both forecasters note active GOP recruitment efforts (Cotton, Grassley, McCormick, Barrasso), which I underweighted - this creates a pull factor, not just push factors from Democratic tensions. Forecaster 2's characterization of the situation as 'genuinely volatile' with documented anger, isolation, and high-level staff departures is compelling. The point about potential Democratic sanctions triggering a reactive bolt is also worth considering. However, I believe both forecasters may be underweighting the 33-day timeline constraint. Even Manchin and Sinema - the recent examples of Democratic defection - took years of public disagreement before making moves, and Sinema only went independent. Party switches typically involve extended negotiations over committee assignments and require careful political positioning. While the behavioral signals and active recruitment are real, executing a formal caucus change in one month would be extraordinarily rapid by historical standards.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the alternative analyses, I'm updating my forecast modestly upward from 3% to 5%. The specific behavioral evidence (leaving group chat, skipping lunches) and active GOP courtship represent genuinely new information that increases tail risk beyond what I initially assessed. These concrete signs of withdrawal make the possibility slightly more plausible than general reports of friction would suggest. However, I remain anchored closer to my original estimate than the 7-8% range because the 33-day window remains the dominant constraint. Formal caucus changes require public announcements, committee reassignments, and political positioning that typically unfold over months, not weeks. Fetterman's explicit statement about not resigning also carries significant weight. The base rate for mid-term Senate caucus switches remains extremely low - we're talking about events that happen less than once per decade. While his unconventional nature and the documented volatility increase the probability of unexpected behavior, I don't believe they overcome the structural barriers and time constraints sufficiently to justify a forecast above 5%.",
