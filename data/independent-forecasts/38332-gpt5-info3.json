  "information": "As of early June 2025, the government of Uruguay had not issued an official public statement confirming or denying President Orsi's attendance at the BRICS summit. Media coverage at the time described the country's participation as 'undecided' or 'up in the air.' The BRICS summit is scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro on July 6-7, 2025. Other leaders, including India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are planning to attend.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (deadline: before 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — if nothing changes, there is no announcement by the Uruguayan government confirming President Orsi’s personal attendance before July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Montevideo keeps its stance as “undecided” and does not issue a confirmation by June 30, or indicates that Uruguay will be represented by the foreign minister or another official instead of the president, or quietly lets the issue ride without a formal acceptance before the cutoff.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Presidency (Presidencia de la República) or the Foreign Ministry (MRREE) publicly confirms—via press release, official social account, or on-the-record remarks—that President Yamandú Orsi will travel to Rio de Janeiro to attend the BRICS Summit, and does so before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Time is short but still sufficient for a decision. As of early June, per the assistant’s report, Uruguay had not confirmed or denied Orsi’s attendance and media described participation as “up in the air.” The BRICS summit (July 6–7 in Rio) is nearby and logistically easy for Uruguay, and Lula’s invitation creates diplomatic incentive for a new Broad Front administration to show engagement with regional partners and with BRICS broadly. The cost of attending as a guest is low and aligns with Uruguay’s long-standing strategy of diversifying external ties (including interest in a China FTA), which nudges the probability upward. \nCountervailing factors: Uruguay often balances relations with the US/EU, and may avoid signaling alignment with BRICS if it complicates Mercosur dynamics or other priorities. A common compromise is to send the foreign minister rather than the president—this would produce a No. The fact that the government was still undecided in early June and has not already announced suggests genuine hesitation or scheduling considerations, which keeps the probability from being high. \nWhy not higher: lingering indecision, potential preference to keep options open or send a lower-level delegation, and the possibility of domestic agenda constraints for a newly inaugurated president. \nWhy not lower: proximity to Brazil, positive ties with Lula, low-cost diplomacy as a guest, and the Broad Front’s generally pragmatic openness to BRICS countries. \nWhat would move me up: any credible reporting that Orsi plans a bilateral with Lula around the summit; inclusion of Orsi on a provisional attendee list by Brazil; publication of Orsi’s late-June travel agenda by the Presidency or MRREE; statements from senior Uruguayan officials framing BRICS attendance as strategically valuable. \nWhat would move me down: reports that Uruguay will be represented by the foreign minister or another official; indications of scheduling conflicts (e.g., fixed domestic commitments in late June/early July); signals of US/EU-focused travel or meetings that crowd out the trip; continued silence into the final week of June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early June 2025, the government of Uruguay had not issued an official public statement confirming or denying President Orsi's attendance at the BRICS summit. Media coverage at the time described the country's participation as 'undecided' or 'up in the air.' The BRICS summit is scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro on July 6-7, 2025. Other leaders, including India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are planning to attend.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
