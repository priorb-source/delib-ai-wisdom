    "review": "The other two forecasters raise critical points that challenge my initial analysis. Both correctly emphasize India's high base rate for large protests, a factor I believe I significantly underweight. Forecaster 3's argument to check the Global Protest Tracker's own historical data for India is particularly compelling; if the source itself documents several qualifying protests annually, the probability of one occurring in any given two-month window is substantial. Critically, both forecasters implicitly or explicitly use a less restrictive interpretation of the resolution criteria than I did. I had read the clause excluding 'active' protests as requiring a completely new social movement about a new topic. Their analyses made me reconsider this. The more likely interpretation is that a new protest *event*, with a start date after the question launch, would count, even if it is part of a broader, ongoing social movement. This lowers the bar for a 'Yes' resolution considerably. I find Forecaster 3's reasoning the most convincing in establishing the baseline probability, while Forecaster 2's 55% forecast seems to better balance that baseline against the risk of reporting lags and the short timeframe.",
    "rationale": "I am making a significant update to my forecast, moving from 20% to 50%. My initial low probability was based on a flawed and overly strict interpretation of the resolution criteria, specifically the clause that a protest 'active at the launch of this question does not count'. I believed this required the emergence of an entirely new cause for protest, which is a rare event in a short timeframe. The other forecasters have convinced me that a more reasonable interpretation is that any protest *event* with a start date after May 2, 2025, will count, even if it's related to an ongoing issue like the farmers' disputes or the land law controversy. This fundamentally changes the forecast. The primary driver is now the high base rate of large-scale protests in India, as correctly identified by both other forecasters. If the Global Protest Tracker typically logs several 10,000+ participant protests in India per year, the statistical likelihood of one starting within a two-month period is high. My updated forecast of 50% reflects this high base rate, balanced against two key constraints: the short, two-month window and the significant, unquantifiable risk of a reporting lag from the specific resolution source, the Carnegie Endowment's tracker. A protest occurring in late June might not be documented by the July 1st deadline. Therefore, I see the outcome as a coin flip, representing the high chance of an event occurring versus the operational risks of it not being reported in time.",
