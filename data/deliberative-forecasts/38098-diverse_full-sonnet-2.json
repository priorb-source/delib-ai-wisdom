    "review": "Both forecasters present well-reasoned analyses that closely align with my initial assessment. I found two arguments particularly compelling that I hadn't emphasized sufficiently: (1) Forecaster 2's point about the extreme difficulty of challenging a Trump-endorsed incumbent in a GOP primary, which is a powerful disincentive for Norman; and (2) Forecaster 3's observation that there is no filing deadline pressure until spring 2026, which removes any structural urgency for an early declaration. These points strengthen the case for an even lower probability. All three of us identified the same core evidence: explicit denials from Norman's office, complete absence of campaign infrastructure, focus on the gubernatorial race, and the compressed timeline. The convergence across all three forecasts (2-3%) suggests we're calibrated on the right order of magnitude.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the Trump endorsement of Graham is a more significant factor than I initially weighted. In contemporary GOP politics, challenging a Trump-endorsed incumbent is an extraordinarily difficult proposition that would require exceptional circumstances. Combined with the lack of any filing urgency—the 2026 primary filing period doesn't even open until spring 2026—there is virtually no reason for Norman to announce by July 1, 2025. A candidate might announce early to build momentum, secure donors, or establish name recognition, but all evidence suggests Norman is pursuing a different office (governor) and has explicitly denied Senate plans. The only scenarios that lead to Yes are truly unexpected: a dramatic Graham scandal, a sudden pivot by Norman despite public denials, or some unforeseen political earthquake. While I maintain a small non-zero probability for such black swan events, the additional emphasis on Graham's Trump endorsement and the absence of filing pressure warrant moving my forecast slightly lower to align with Forecaster 2's more conservative estimate.",
