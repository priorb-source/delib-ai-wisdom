    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until the June 1, 2025 check)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — CDC keeps Colombia at Level 2 (Practice Enhanced Precautions) through the check on/after June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Yellow fever activity remains regionally contained; Colombia ramps vaccination in affected departments; CDC maintains a Level 2 notice (or multiple disease-specific Level 1–2 notices) rather than escalating to Level 3.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp, documented deterioration: widespread/urban yellow fever transmission in major cities with vaccine shortages, substantial traveler risk (including U.S. traveler cases), strained healthcare capacity, and CDC upgrades Colombia’s page to Level 3: Avoid Nonessential Travel before the June 1 check.",
    "rationale": "I’m forecasting based on the explicit resolution rule: it resolves Yes if the CDC destination page for Colombia shows a level greater than 2 when checked on or after June 1, 2025. The headline mentions “above level 3,” but CDC Travel Health Notices typically run 1–3; functionally, this means we’re asking whether it will be Level 3 by the check date.\n\nBaseline and inertia: CDC rarely assigns Level 3 for a country due to endemic vector-borne diseases when effective mitigation (e.g., vaccination, repellents) exists. Even during Brazil’s large yellow fever outbreaks (2016–2018), CDC’s notices were generally Level 2 rather than Level 3. Level 3 has been used sparingly in recent years, typically for extraordinary outbreaks where avoiding nonessential travel is justified by high risk and limited mitigation. With only about 5–6 weeks until the check, institutional inertia and review cycles further favor the status quo.\n\nCurrent signal: There are media reports of a yellow fever outbreak and economic concerns in Colombia. That raises risk somewhat, but to reach Level 3 quickly would likely require: verified sustained urban transmission in major population centers or tourist hubs, significant vaccine access constraints, rising severe/fatal cases including among travelers, and public-health system strain. Absent clear evidence of those, CDC is more likely to maintain Level 2 and emphasize vaccination for at-risk areas.\n\nWhy not higher: Level 3 is uncommon for yellow fever-endemic settings; a short time window; and no clear, widely reported CDC/WHO escalations indicating imminent Level 3 criteria (urban spread, traveler cases, vaccine shortage) as of now.\n\nWhy not lower: The cited outbreak and Colombia’s emergency framing mean a non-trivial tail risk exists; if conditions deteriorate quickly (or if there are high-profile traveler cases), CDC could move faster than usual.\n\nWhat would move me up: WHO or Colombian MoH confirmation of urban yellow fever transmission in major cities (e.g., Bogotá, Medellín, Cartagena); documented vaccine shortages impacting travelers; multiple confirmed U.S. traveler infections; CDC issuing a special Level 3 notice for Colombia or similar language indicating ‘avoid nonessential travel.’\n\nWhat would move me down: Reports showing cases stabilizing or confined to rural departments; successful vaccination campaigns; CDC posting only Level 1–2 disease-specific notices; explicit statements from CDC maintaining Level 2 guidance.\n\nResearch assistant input: None beyond links; no additional concrete data provided, so I lean more on historical CDC practice and the short timeline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Travel Health Notice status of Colombia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/colombia), which is \"Level 2 Practice Enhanced Precautions\" at the time of this question, is a level of greater than 2 when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
