  "information": "According to reports in mid-April 2025 from sources including uol.com.br and Sports.ru, Johnny Walker was scheduled to fight the undefeated Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316 on June 7-8 in Newark, New Jersey. At the time of the announcement, Murzakanov held a professional record of 14-0 and was noted for winning three of his four UFC bouts by knockout or technical knockout. He was returning from an 180-day suspension for an anti-doping violation, which was set to end on May 1, 2025. Walker's record was cited as 21-9, and he was entering the fight on a two-fight losing streak.\n\nMultiple news outlets, including RotoWire on May 6, 2025, and MMA Fighting on May 9, 2025, reported that Johnny Walker had withdrawn from his scheduled bout against Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316. The reason provided for the withdrawal was an injury. Walker's official Wikipedia page was also updated to reflect his withdrawal from the event.\n\nFollowing Johnny Walker's withdrawal, it was announced that Azamat Murzakanov would remain on the UFC 316 card against a new opponent. As reported by MMA Fighting and Championat.com around May 7-9, 2025, Brendson Ribeiro was signed as the replacement fighter. Ribeiro entered the fight with a professional record of 15-7. The updated UFC 316 bout sheet officially listed the light heavyweight clash as Azamat Murzakanov vs. Brendson Ribeiro.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12 days (UFC 316 is June 7–8, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Walker withdrew and is not currently scheduled to fight Murzakanov at UFC 316.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Walker remains out and Murzakanov fights Brendson Ribeiro as listed; or Walker fights someone else or doesn’t fight at all at UFC 316; or Walker vs. Murzakanov happens but Walker does not defeat him (loss/draw/NC).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A late change removes Ribeiro and reinstates Walker vs. Murzakanov at UFC 316, Walker is medically cleared and accepts on short notice, the bout occurs, and Walker wins.",
    "rationale": "The status quo is that Johnny Walker has withdrawn due to injury and the UFC has booked Azamat Murzakanov vs. Brendson Ribeiro for UFC 316, per multiple outlets (MMA Fighting, RotoWire) and an updated bout sheet; Walker’s Wikipedia was also updated. With roughly 12 days left, reverting to the original matchup would require multiple unlikely events: Walker’s injury resolving and medical clearance, Ribeiro coming off the card, the UFC rebooking Walker vs. Murzakanov on short notice, and then Walker actually winning. Even if the matchup were improbably restored, Walker would likely be an underdog against an undefeated Murzakanov, making the conditional probability of a Walker win well below 50%. Therefore, the dominant path is No. I keep a small non-zero probability to account for last-minute card shuffles. I would raise the forecast only on credible reports or official listings that Walker has been reinserted to face Murzakanov (e.g., UFC bout sheet updated, commission bout agreement filed, weigh-ins faceoff). I would lower toward zero as Ribeiro successfully weighs in and the bout proceeds, or if there is confirmation Walker will not compete at UFC 316.",
