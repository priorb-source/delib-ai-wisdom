    "no_outcome_scenario": "The junta maintains the May 13 decree dissolving all parties and associations through June, continuing to consolidate power and suppress organized opposition, with no meaningful external leverage forcing a climbdown.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing unexpected, acute pressure—such as large, sustained domestic protests and strikes, credible elite splits or a factional shake-up, or imminent regional/financial penalties from WAEMU/major donors—the government issues a new decree rescinding the May 13 order and reauthorizes party formation and activity before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Context: Mali’s military rulers have progressively centralized power since the 2020–2021 coups, postponed elections, exited ECOWAS (formalized after a one-year notice), and pivoted away from Western partners. Dissolving all political parties and associations on May 13, 2025 fits this consolidation trend. Similar Sahel juntas (Burkina Faso, Niger) have suspended party politics without quick reversals.\n- Timeframe: Only ~5.5 weeks remain. Rapid U-turns on core political-control measures are rare absent extreme shocks.\n- External pressure: With ECOWAS leverage diminished post-withdrawal and MINUSMA gone, international pressure is muted. WAEMU financial pressure is a conceivable lever but there’s no clear sign of imminent, decisive sanctions strictly tied to this decree. Russia-aligned support further reduces Western leverage.\n- Domestic dynamics: The decree suggests confidence in repressing opposition. Courts and institutions are under junta influence, making legal reversal unlikely. While protests or strikes could emerge, they would have to be unusually large and sustained, within a short window, to force a public climbdown.\n- Why not higher: A reversal would signal weakness and contradict the regime’s trajectory; there’s limited time and limited external leverage. \n- Why not lower: Small tails remain—symbolic or tactical concessions are sometimes used to defuse crises; an intra-junta rift or surprise mediation could prompt a narrow, face-saving repeal that reinstates party activity.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of major nationwide protests/strikes, a visible elite split or attempted putsch, clear WAEMU or key donor conditionality with near-term penalties, or official hints of a timetable to restore parties in June.\n- What would move me down: Continued arrests of opposition figures, new restrictive decrees, or statements doubling down on the ban with no transitional timeline.\n- Research assistant: No additional information available; forecast relies on general regional patterns, current power dynamics, and the short horizon.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Mali reverse its decision to dissolve all political parties?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mali's Military Government Shuts Down All Political Parties](https://www.legit.ng/world/africa/1654992-malis-military-government-shuts-political-parties/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the government of Mali announces a reversal of its May 13, 2025 presidential decree dissolving all political parties in the country.\n\nA partial reversal, such as allowing the reinstatement of a limited number of parties, will only count as long as new parties are generally allowed to be formed again.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
