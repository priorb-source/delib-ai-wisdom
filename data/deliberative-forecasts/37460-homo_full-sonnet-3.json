    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I hadn't adequately weighted: if massive protests with hundreds of thousands (possibly millions) of participants have already occurred between March 19 and May 7, why hasn't the Global Protest Tracker reported them yet? This absence is puzzling and suggests either significant reporting lags, specific inclusion criteria we don't understand, limited Turkey coverage, or slow verification processes. Forecaster 2 and I both arrived at 82% but perhaps didn't sufficiently account for this absence as evidence about the tracker's practices. However, I also note that we don't have explicit confirmation the tracker hasn't reported these events - we only infer this from the question still being open. The tracker could have reported them with the question having specific resolution procedures we're unaware of.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the unexplained absence of tracker reporting despite massive, well-documented protests is more significant than I initially weighted. This introduces real uncertainty about the tracker's coverage practices, verification timelines, or inclusion criteria for Turkish protests. However, several factors prevent me from dropping as low as 72%: (1) We have 55 days remaining, providing substantial time for either past protests to be added or new large protests to occur and be reported; (2) The scale of recent protests (100,000s-2,000,000 participants) so dramatically exceeds the 10,000 threshold that even partial or delayed reporting seems likely; (3) CHP's explicit commitment to continued protests combined with volatile political conditions (opposition mayor's arrest, 48.6% inflation) make additional large protests highly probable; (4) We lack direct evidence the tracker systematically excludes Turkey - the absence could reflect reporting lag rather than exclusion. The convergence at 82% between Forecaster 2 and myself, versus Forecaster 3's more cautious 72%, suggests the appropriate range is 72-82%. Splitting this difference while weighting the concerning observation about current reporting gaps, I'm updating to 77%.",
