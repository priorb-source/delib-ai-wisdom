    "review": "- Forecaster 2 leans heavily on the assumption that Q1 earnings will be posted on the News page and claims this is historically consistent. That conflicts with the research assistant’s concrete evidence that the Feb 26 Q4 2024 results and the Q1 date announcement were not on the News page. Without specific historical examples to the contrary, I find F2’s central premise weak. Also, the RA already noted the IR/PR wire separation, which lowers the probability that May earnings will produce a News post.\n- Forecaster 3’s reasoning aligns with my prior view: very sparse News cadence, operational hiatus limiting newsy catalysts, and the key caveat that earnings could be cross-posted. Their added color on the hiatus/Delta assembly supports the low cadence expectation.\n- New arguments considered: F3’s elaboration on operational pipeline (no flights until 2026, early assembly) strengthens the base-rate for continued silence. F2’s assertion about past practice raises a potential counterfactual, but it’s not substantiated and is contradicted by recent behavior.",
    "rationale": "The decisive factor is the apparent separation between Investor Relations communications and the main News page. Recent, highly relevant items (Q4 2024 results and the Q1 results-date PR) were not mirrored on News, making it less likely that the May 15 Q1 results will appear there. Combine this with a three-month dry spell and a thin pipeline of operational announcements during the Delta development phase, and the status quo favors no May News post. A nontrivial risk remains: they could use May to issue a program/milestone update, an executive/board change, a partnership, or decide to cross-post earnings. But given the fresh evidence of non-cross-posting and reduced cadence, I nudge my estimate slightly upward.\n\nChange: Up from 72% to 74%, reflecting added confidence from F3’s operational context and the weakness in F2’s historical-earnings-posting claim.",
