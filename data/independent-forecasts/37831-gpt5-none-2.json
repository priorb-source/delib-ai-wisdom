    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the junta maintains the May 13, 2025 decree dissolving all political parties through June 30.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The military government keeps parties dissolved while consolidating power, citing security and ‘transition’ needs, perhaps promising a future framework for associations after the deadline but not before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to acute domestic unrest, elite/religious pressure, or meaningful international/economic pressure, the junta rescinds the decree and allows parties to re-register and new parties to form, possibly as part of announcing a near-term electoral or dialogue process.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and Mali’s military authorities have consistently centralized power since the 2020–21 coups: delaying elections, curbing civil space, leaving ECOWAS, and aligning with partners that do not condition support on political liberalization. Dissolving all parties on May 13 is a high-salience move; reversing within six weeks would be a public climbdown with little current incentive. External leverage is limited after ECOWAS withdrawal; Western pressure has had little impact; Russia-linked support reduces vulnerability to sanctions. Thus, the status quo (no reversal) deserves heavy weight. That said, autocratic regimes can make abrupt tactical concessions if facing unexpected shocks: large protests/strikes, elite splits, sharp economic/aid pressures (e.g., budget support at risk), or a decision to announce near-term elections requiring party participation. I have no additional research updates beyond the prompt. Why not higher: short timeline, entrenched trajectory toward tighter control, weak external pressure. Why not lower: regime volatility and potential for tactical U-turns to manage legitimacy or economic needs. Upward update triggers: credible reports of negotiations with major domestic stakeholders, a court or legal body signaling noncompliance (unlikely but possible), new donor conditionalities biting, or an official calendar requiring parties to participate. Downward update triggers: further repression measures, creation of regime-built political structures replacing parties, or statements reaffirming the ban through the rest of 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Mali reverse its decision to dissolve all political parties?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mali's Military Government Shuts Down All Political Parties](https://www.legit.ng/world/africa/1654992-malis-military-government-shuts-political-parties/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the government of Mali announces a reversal of its May 13, 2025 presidential decree dissolving all political parties in the country.\n\nA partial reversal, such as allowing the reinstatement of a limited number of parties, will only count as long as new parties are generally allowed to be formed again.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
