    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12 days (polling 1 May 2025; results likely by 2 May 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the Conservatives remain the largest group (as in 2021), with Independents and others splitting the anti-Conservative vote",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Conservatives, despite national headwinds, hold onto enough rural divisions to stay largest, while Independents and Labour take chunks of anti-Tory votes in towns and former Lib Dem pockets, leaving the Lib Dems second. Alternatively, a strong Independent surge fragments the field and pips the Lib Dems for first place.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Lib Dems field a near-full slate, convert national anti-Conservative sentiment into rural and small-town gains, recapture historic strongholds, and edge out Conservatives and Independents to finish as the largest group (e.g., around 28–35 of 87 seats). Labour’s strength remains concentrated, limiting their countywide total.",
    "rationale": "- Context and baseline: In 2021 (87 seats), the Conservatives won a majority and were the largest group; Lib Dems were third. If the world changes slowly, the baseline is that Conservatives would again be largest. However, since 2021 the national environment has shifted sharply against the Conservatives, and the South West has seen pronounced Conservative-to-Lib Dem swings in recent local contests and in the 2024 general election. Cornwall also has a tradition of Independents and Lib Dem local strength.\n- Structure of the contest: With 87 single-member divisions, Independents can win a meaningful share, and Labour’s vote is likely to be concentrated in a subset of urban divisions. That structure helps the Lib Dems in a plurality race if they can run a full slate and efficiently target Tory-held rural seats. Finishing first may require only high-20s to low-30s seats if the field fragments.\n- Why not higher: 1) Independents can overperform in Cornwall and could deny the Lib Dems first place even if the Conservatives fall back. 2) Labour’s improved standing since 2021 could peel off key town divisions the Lib Dems need to top the table. 3) Lack of ward-level polling introduces execution risk (candidate coverage, ground game variability).\n- Why not lower: 1) The Conservatives’ national drag makes a repeat of 2021 unlikely; they are at real risk of losing many rural divisions. 2) Historically, the Lib Dems are competitive across Cornwall at local level and are well-placed to capitalize on anti-Tory sentiment relative to Labour in rural wards. 3) Finishing as the largest group requires only a plurality, not overall control.\n- What would move me up: Evidence of a near-full Lib Dem slate, strong by-election swings in Cornwall since 2021 toward Lib Dems, local polling or credible reporting showing Conservatives collapsing in rural divisions, or visible Labour focus elsewhere. \n- What would move me down: Signs of widespread strong Independents’ candidacies, Labour contesting and polling competitively across many wards, or reports that Lib Dem candidate coverage/ground game is patchy.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information was provided; forecast relies on 2021 results context, general national/regional trends, and Cornwall’s historical voting patterns.\n\nBalancing the status quo with current headwinds and multi-party dynamics, I give the Lib Dems a slight edge to finish with the most seats, but with substantial uncertainty.",
