    "review": "Both other forecasters have arrived at the same 20% probability, which is double my initial forecast. Their reasoning is sound and aligns with the key variables I considered: the very short timeframe, the strong status quo bias, and the historical precedent of Kadyrov making similar statements. The main point of departure is the weight they assign to the May 6 statement. I initially viewed it almost exclusively as a repeat of past political theater, and thus a signal with very low value. They convincingly argue that the statement itself is a significant political act, and that when viewed against the current backdrop of persistent and credible health rumors, it carries more weight than his previous remarks. Forecaster 3's synthesis, which treats the health rumors as an underlying pressure and the public statement as a potential catalyst or signal, is particularly persuasive. They have convinced me that I was likely underweighting the significance of this new statement in the current context.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 10% to 15%. The core reasoning for a 'No' outcome remains very strong: Ramzan Kadyrov is a deeply entrenched leader, the timeframe is less than three weeks, and he has a clear history of making similar statements about stepping down only to remain in power. This powerful status quo bias formed the basis of my initial, low forecast.\n\nHowever, my fellow forecasters' analyses have convinced me that my 10% forecast was too heavily anchored on this historical precedent and did not sufficiently account for the new context. The key difference between this instance and previous ones is the increased public reporting and credible speculation surrounding Kadyrov's severe health issues. The other forecasters correctly argue that his public statement on May 6, while perhaps not a direct announcement of resignation, is a more significant signal in this new context. It could be a primer for a health-mandated exit, a loyalty test to the Kremlin under new duress, or a sign of internal political maneuvering related to his potential incapacitation. The combination of a plausible underlying cause (ill health) and a fresh public signal (the statement) increases the probability of a change in leadership before June 1.\n\nWhile I am adjusting my forecast upwards to 15% to reflect this increased risk, I remain slightly more conservative than my peers' 20%. I still believe the most probable interpretation is that this is political maneuvering rather than a direct prelude to a resignation within the next 19 days. However, I concede that the possibility of *this time being different* is higher than I initially assessed.",
