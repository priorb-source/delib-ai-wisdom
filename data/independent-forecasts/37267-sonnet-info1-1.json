  "information": "Ethiopia's travel advisory from the US State Department is currently 'Level 3 – Reconsider Travel'. This was confirmed by multiple news reports from early May 2025 and a review on April 30, 2025, which did not place Ethiopia on the list of 21 countries with a 'Level 4' advisory. The State Department last downgraded Ethiopia from Level 4 to Level 3 in early 2023. While the nationwide advisory is Level 3, specific regions within Ethiopia, including Tigray and parts of Amhara, Oromia, Gambella, and Benishangul-Gumuz, carry a Level 4 warning due to localized conflicts.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 60 days, from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ethiopia maintains its current Level 3 'Reconsider Travel' advisory through July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ethiopia's security situation remains at current levels with regional conflicts staying localized in Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, Gambella, and Benishangul-Gumuz. The US State Department continues to assess that a nationwide Level 3 advisory is appropriate, with Level 4 advisories remaining limited to specific high-risk regions. No major incidents or deterioration prompt an upgrade.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant, rapid deterioration in security conditions occurs across Ethiopia, such as nationwide expansion of regional conflicts, major terrorist attacks affecting multiple areas, widespread civil unrest, or complete breakdown of government authority. This prompts the State Department to conduct an emergency review and upgrade Ethiopia to Level 4 within the 60-day window.",
    "rationale": "Several factors strongly favor the status quo outcome. The US State Department conducted a review just two days ago (April 30, 2025) that explicitly confirmed Ethiopia is NOT among the 21 countries with Level 4 advisories. This timing is critical - agencies don't typically reverse major decisions within weeks absent extraordinary circumstances. Additionally, Ethiopia's recent trajectory has been positive, having been downgraded FROM Level 4 TO Level 3 in early 2023, indicating improvement rather than deterioration. The 60-day timeframe is quite short for the type of dramatic security deterioration that would warrant such an upgrade. Level 4 advisories represent the most serious classification, reserved for countries where the State Department believes American citizens face imminent danger. While Ethiopia does have serious regional security concerns - evidenced by Level 4 warnings for specific areas like Tigray and parts of Amhara, Oromia, Gambella, and Benishangul-Gumuz - the fact that these haven't triggered a nationwide Level 4 advisory suggests the State Department views the risks as localized rather than systemic. What keeps my probability from being even lower (below 5%) is that conflict zones can deteriorate rapidly, and Ethiopia does face ongoing security challenges. A major unexpected event - such as a significant terrorist attack, coup attempt, or escalation of regional conflicts - could theoretically prompt an emergency upgrade. However, for this to result in a YES outcome, such events would need to occur AND the State Department would need to process and implement an advisory change within just 60 days. For my forecast to move significantly higher, I would need evidence of: major ongoing deterioration in security conditions, statements from US officials expressing heightened concern, or intelligence suggesting imminent threats. For it to move lower, I would need confirmation of security improvements or explicit State Department statements about maintaining the Level 3 status.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
