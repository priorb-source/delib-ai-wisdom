    "review": "The other two forecasters provide analyses that are highly aligned with my own, centering on the key principles of macroeconomic inertia and the significance of the most recent data point (+1.49% YoY growth for April 2025). We all agree that a reversal from solid positive growth to negative in a single month is improbable without a major, observable economic shock, none of which have been reported for May. Both Forecaster 2 and 3 add valuable, specific details to the downside risks. Forecaster 3's point about the weather-sensitivity of the utilities component is particularly well-taken as a plausible, non-catastrophic mechanism that could lead to a negative surprise. Forecaster 2's mention of base effects is also a standard and valid consideration. Their reasoning is highly convincing and reinforces the core logic for a high-probability 'Yes' forecast.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 90% was based on the same core logic as the other forecasters: strong inertia from the +1.49% YoY growth in April makes a negative print for May highly unlikely given the absence of any reported shocks. After reviewing the other analyses, I find their reasoning compelling and their slightly higher confidence to be justified. The consensus at 92% is a strong signal that my initial probability may have been slightly too conservative, giving too much weight to the possibility of statistical noise erasing a nearly 1.5 percentage point buffer. A swing of that magnitude in the year-over-year growth rate in a single month is a rare event. While they didn't present new data, their confidence and articulation of specific, bounded risks (like a mild May's effect on utilities) strengthens my conviction in the primary 'inertia' thesis. Therefore, I am updating my forecast upward by two percentage points to align with the expert consensus.",
