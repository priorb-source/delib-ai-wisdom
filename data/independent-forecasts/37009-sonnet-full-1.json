  "information": "According to an April 19, 2025, Politico report, Haley Stevens was 'widely expected to declare her Senate candidacy as early as next week.' On the same day, both the Washington Examiner and the Livingston Post reported that Stevens was expected to announce her bid 'in the coming weeks,' a slightly more ambiguous timeframe.\n\nAs of April 15, 2025, Haley Stevens had $1.6 million in her campaign fund, having raised approximately $1.2 million in the first quarter of the year. Reports also indicate that she has expanded her campaign staff and has been contacting potential candidates to replace her in her current House seat.\n\nSeveral prominent Democrats, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, have opted not to run for the Senate seat. Meanwhile, other Democratic candidates such as Mallory McMorrow and Abdul El-Sayed have already officially entered the race. As of late April 2025, Stevens had not filed any paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form an exploratory committee.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 9-10 days until May 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Haley Stevens has not yet announced her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Stevens delays her announcement beyond May 1, 2025, either due to continued deliberation, logistics, or decides to make the announcement in early May when the phrase 'coming weeks' would still be accurate but after the May 1 deadline",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Stevens follows through on the widespread media expectations and announces her candidacy during the final week of April 2025, consistent with Politico's report that she would declare 'as early as next week' from their April 19 reporting date",
    "rationale": "The forecast hinges on an extremely tight timeline. As of April 21, there are only 9-10 days until the May 1 deadline. The most significant evidence comes from fresh, April 19 reporting by Politico stating Stevens was 'widely expected to declare her Senate candidacy as early as next week.' This suggests a potential announcement around April 26-30. Supporting this: Stevens has $1.6M in her campaign fund, raised $1.2M in Q1 2025, expanded campaign staff, and contacted potential House seat replacements - all indicators of serious preparation. However, several factors introduce uncertainty: The phrase 'as early as next week' implies that timeline could slip later. Washington Examiner's 'coming weeks' (plural) suggests a less urgent timeline that could easily extend past May 1. Critically, she has not filed FEC paperwork for an exploratory committee, though this could happen simultaneously with an announcement. Political announcement timelines frequently slip due to logistics, coordination needs, or strategic considerations. The status quo strongly favors 'No' since she hasn't announced yet, and base rates suggest most expected announcements face delays. My forecast would increase toward 75-80% if Stevens filed FEC paperwork or if more specific reporting emerged about an announcement date before May 1. It would decrease toward 30-40% if we passed April 25-26 without any announcement or updated reporting. The 60% probability reflects that recent, specific reporting makes an announcement more likely than not, while acknowledging the very tight timeline and historical tendency for political announcements to slip.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
