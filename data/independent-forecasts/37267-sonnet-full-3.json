  "information": "Ethiopia's travel advisory from the US State Department is currently 'Level 3 – Reconsider Travel'. This was confirmed by multiple news reports from early May 2025 and a review on April 30, 2025, which did not place Ethiopia on the list of 21 countries with a 'Level 4' advisory. The State Department last downgraded Ethiopia from Level 4 to Level 3 in early 2023. While the nationwide advisory is Level 3, specific regions within Ethiopia, including Tigray and parts of Amhara, Oromia, Gambella, and Benishangul-Gumuz, carry a Level 4 warning due to localized conflicts.\n\nThe US State Department advisory system has four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). As of early May 2025, 21 countries were under a Level 4 advisory for reasons including terrorism, civil unrest, war, and health emergencies. Historically, out of the 25–35 countries typically at Level 3, only 2–4 are upgraded to Level 4 in a given year. Upgrades from Level 3 to Level 4 often follow clear catalysts such as coups, invasions, airport closures, hostage incidents involving foreigners, or the ordered departure of non-essential U.S. embassy staff.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, the U.S. announced sanctions related to renewed violence in the Tigray and Amhara regions. Ethiopia has neighboring countries, specifically Sudan and South Sudan, that are already under a Level 4 advisory. As of early May 2025, there have been no reports of a new nationwide offensive, a coup attempt, or a mass-casualty event involving foreigners since the sanctions were announced.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ethiopia remains at Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) status",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ethiopia maintains its current Level 3 advisory through July 1, 2025. The security situation in conflict-affected regions (Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, etc.) remains contained at current levels with regional Level 4 warnings, but no nationwide escalation occurs. The government maintains control in Addis Ababa and major cities, and no major catalysts (coups, mass-casualty events involving foreigners, embassy evacuations, or airport closures) materialize.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major security deterioration prompts an upgrade to Level 4. This could involve: violence spreading from regional conflicts to Addis Ababa or other major cities; a military coup or government collapse; major terrorist attacks targeting foreigners or Americans; hostage situations; ordered departure of US embassy personnel; closure of international airports; or a nationwide escalation of the Tigray/Amhara conflicts that overwhelms government control. The May 1 sanctions signal accelerating deterioration beyond what regional Level 4 warnings capture.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors a No outcome. Historically, only 2-4 countries out of 25-35 at Level 3 are upgraded to Level 4 annually, suggesting roughly 6-15% annual probability, or approximately 1-2.5% over a 2-month period. However, upgrades are not evenly distributed—they follow specific catalysts. Key evidence against upgrade: (1) The State Department just reviewed advisories on April 30, 2025 and maintained Ethiopia at Level 3; (2) Ethiopia was downgraded from Level 4 to Level 3 in early 2023, indicating improved conditions; (3) Current violence is localized to regions already carrying Level 4 warnings—the compartmentalized nature suggests the State Department views this as manageable rather than nationwide threat; (4) No reports of clear catalysts like coups, embassy evacuations, or attacks on foreigners since May 1 sanctions. Factors creating elevated risk above base rate: (1) Sanctions announced May 1, 2025 for renewed violence signal deteriorating conditions; (2) Multiple active conflict zones (Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, Gambella, Benishangul-Gumuz); (3) Two-month timeframe allows for potential rapid escalation; (4) Neighboring countries Sudan and South Sudan are at Level 4. My forecast is not higher because: the recent advisory review maintained Level 3, violence remains regionally contained with existing Level 4 warnings capturing the worst areas, and there's no evidence of nationwide escalation or specific catalysts that typically trigger upgrades. My forecast is not lower because: the fresh sanctions indicate active deterioration, multiple conflict zones create compound risks, and the short 2-month timeframe means even low-probability events have meaningful chances of occurring. I would update higher with: evidence of violence spreading to Addis Ababa, attacks on foreigners, embassy staff departures, airport closures, or coup attempts. I would update lower with: peace agreements, continued stability through May/June, or de-escalation in conflict regions.",
