    "review": "All three forecasters converge on remarkably similar analyses and forecasts (3%, 3%, 4%), which increases my confidence in this range. We all emphasize the same core constraints: the extremely compressed 67-day timeline, formal IRS procedural requirements, inevitable legal challenges with injunctions/TROs, and zero historical precedent for major universities losing tax-exempt status on such timelines. Forecaster 2's framing of four conditions that must all occur is particularly useful - each is individually unlikely, making their conjunction extremely improbable. Forecaster 3 raises a valid point about the Trump administration's demonstrated willingness to take aggressive administrative actions, which could justify a slightly higher forecast. However, this consideration is balanced against the specific procedural barriers: IRS revocation processes cannot simply be bypassed even under political pressure without triggering immediate and likely successful legal challenges. The convergence around 3-4% from three independent forecasters suggests we're appropriately calibrated on the tail risk of unprecedented action while properly weighing the substantial structural barriers.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, I find strong agreement on the fundamental reasoning. The key constraints remain: (1) only 67 days remaining, (2) no evidence of formal proceedings initiated, (3) procedural requirements that typically take months minimum, (4) immediate legal challenges from Harvard with likely temporary injunctions, and (5) zero base rate for comparable situations. While Forecaster 3's point about this administration's willingness for norm-breaking actions has merit, the specific legal and procedural barriers to IRS revocation are well-established and would require extraordinary deviation from standard administrative law. The convergence of all three forecasts at 3-4% suggests appropriate calibration. I'm not updating to 4% because the marginal consideration of aggressive presidential pressure is already incorporated in my tail risk assessment - I explicitly stated I didn't go to 1% because of unusual political circumstances. The difference between 3% and 4% is not meaningful enough to warrant change given no new substantive information beyond what I already considered.",
