  "information": "On May 2, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to stop all federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) Board of Directors and all executive departments and agencies to cease federal financial support. The order requires the CPB Board to ensure its licensees and permittees do not use Federal funds for NPR and PBS. The White House stated the action was taken because the networks allegedly spread 'radical propaganda.' As of May 16, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker still listed the objective as 'in progress.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the objective remains marked as 'in progress' and does not change to 'complete' by the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Project 2025 Tracker maintainers wait for actual implementation evidence beyond just the executive order, such as confirmed cessation of funding flows, resolution of legal challenges, or completion of the fiscal year budget cycle. The status remains 'in progress' through July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The tracker maintainers determine that the May 2 executive order constitutes sufficient evidence of completion, or they receive confirmation of actual funding cessation within the next 46 days, prompting them to update the status to 'complete' before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "The most critical piece of evidence is that despite the executive order being signed 14 days ago (May 2), the tracker still shows 'in progress' as of May 16. This 2-week lag without an update is a strong signal that the tracker maintainers require more than just the signing of an executive order to mark the objective as complete. They may be waiting for: (1) actual implementation and verified cessation of funding flows, (2) resolution of potential legal challenges, (3) concrete evidence that funds have stopped flowing through the federal budget process, or (4) they may have a conservative approach to marking objectives complete. The existence of the executive order is strong evidence that the political objective has been initiated, but the lack of update suggests implementational verification is needed. With 46 days remaining, there is still reasonable time for implementation to occur and be verified. However, we're already roughly one-third through the window between the order and the deadline without movement. The question hinges on what criteria the tracker maintainers use for 'complete' status - if it's merely executive action, we should have seen an update already; if it's actual implementation, that may take longer or face obstacles. I'm not more bullish because the 14-day non-update is a significant negative indicator. I'm not more bearish because there's still substantial time for implementation and the political mechanism (executive order) is in place. This feels like a genuine toss-up with slight lean toward no given the revealed preference of the tracker maintainers.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"stop funding for NPR and PBS\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 2, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to stop all federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
