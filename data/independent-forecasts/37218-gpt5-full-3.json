  "information": "Donald Trump has a history of attending UFC events in the United States, typically appearing at 2 to 4 cards per year since 2019. All of his previous appearances have been at domestic events. He has a strong personal relationship with UFC President Dana White. Trump recently attended a UFC event in Miami in April 2025. Historically, he has not attended two consecutive numbered UFC cards within a one-month span; UFC 315 is scheduled to take place four weeks after the Miami event.\n\nUFC 315 is scheduled for May 10, 2025, at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The event's fight card includes two title fights, with a welterweight championship bout between Belal Muhammad and Jack Della Maddalena as one of the main events. No sitting or former U.S. president has previously attended a UFC event held in Canada or any other foreign country.\n\nJoe Rogan, a prominent UFC commentator, has publicly announced he will not be attending UFC 315 in Montreal. He cited his discontent with the Canadian government as the reason, stating he 'doesn't go to Canada anymore' and would 'rather go to Russia.' Rogan also mentioned that he had discussed US-Canada relations with Donald Trump, who had joked about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12 days (event is May 10, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump stays in the U.S. due to schedule, security, or political considerations and does not travel to Montreal; no appearance is reported at the Bell Centre on fight night.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump pairs a brief Canada visit with a UFC stop or makes a one-off trip specifically to appear with Dana White, showing up backstage or cageside at the Bell Centre during UFC 315.",
    "rationale": "Key inputs from the research assistant: (1) Trump regularly attends UFC events in the U.S. (roughly 2–4 per year since 2019) and has a strong relationship with Dana White; he attended a Miami event in April 2025. (2) He has not historically attended two consecutive numbered cards within a one‑month span. (3) UFC 315 is in Montreal, Canada; no sitting or former U.S. president has attended a UFC event outside the U.S. (4) Joe Rogan publicly said he won’t attend 315 due to Canada, and he and Trump have joked about Trudeau—suggesting limited enthusiasm for a Canada visit. \n\nBase rate and status quo: The default is that U.S.-based appearances dominate Trump’s UFC attendance; international attendance is unprecedented for him. Cross‑border logistics, security coordination (especially if he is the sitting president), and political optics all meaningfully lower odds. He also just attended a UFC event four weeks earlier, which historically correlates with skipping the very next numbered card. As of 12 days out, there are no publicly signaled plans tying him to Montreal (such plans usually generate leaks or hype), so the status quo points to No.\n\nWhy not higher: • International venue (first time for him) with added security and diplomatic coordination. • Very recent attendance in Miami reduces the cadence likelihood. • Absence of Rogan and the Canada-specific political climate reduce the draw. • No advance buzz or schedule indications yet.\n\nWhy not lower: • He does attend UFC with some frequency and values visibility at big cards. • Strong personal tie to Dana White; he sometimes makes unconventional appearances. • Montreal card has multiple title fights; a surprise cameo is not impossible. • If he already has or schedules official/business in Canada, a UFC stop could be appended.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports from major outlets or from Dana White/UFC hinting he’ll attend; official schedule placing him in or near Montreal that weekend; Canadian security/RCMP coordination leaks; flight tracking or local intel indicating an arrival. What would move me down: Firm conflicts on his public schedule in the U.S.; reports that he will be elsewhere that evening; statements from UFC/Dana White indicating he won’t attend; tightened Canada travel constraints for his team.\n\nNet: The slow‑changing status quo plus international constraints dominate. I place the probability low but non‑zero.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
