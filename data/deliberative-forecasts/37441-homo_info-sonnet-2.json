    "review": "The other forecasters provide valuable additional context. Forecaster 2 offers specific data I hadn't considered: Fed rate cut probability by July is only 33-37%, and April jobs data showed 177,000 additions, both suggesting economic resilience that could support the dollar. Forecaster 3 highlights the German defense fund's 1.60% single-day euro appreciation and Bank of America's conservative 1.05 EUR/USD year-end forecast, though they appear to have miscalculated the current USD/EUR level (stating 0.95-0.97 when it's actually around 0.87-0.89 based on EUR/USD at 1.12-1.15). The consensus clustering around 18-20% is notable and suggests we're identifying similar fundamental dynamics. The key insight from both is reinforcing that while dollar weakness has momentum, the magnitude of move required (8-10% in 55 days) remains extreme for major currencies absent extraordinary shocks. Forecaster 2's point about gradualism in currency markets is particularly compelling.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, my core reasoning remains sound. The convergence of all three forecasts at 18-20% increases my confidence that this range appropriately captures the probability. Forecaster 2's specific data on low Fed rate cut probability (33-37%) and resilient jobs numbers strengthens the case that no immediate policy catalyst exists for dramatic dollar weakness. Bank of America's conservative year-end forecast (EUR/USD at 1.05) from Forecaster 3 confirms market consensus expects stability rather than sharp moves. However, the demonstrated 1.60% single-day volatility and ongoing tariff uncertainty prevent going much lower. The May seasonal weakness for EUR/USD actually works against the needed upward move. All factors considered—the 8-10% depreciation needed, 55-day timeframe, low Fed cut probability, economic resilience signals, and professional forecasts suggesting gradualism—point to maintaining my assessment. The cluster of independent forecasts around this level validates the reasoning.",
