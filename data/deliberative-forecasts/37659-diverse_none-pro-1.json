    "review": "Both other forecasters provide strong, skeptical arguments that serve as a valuable counterpoint to my initial, more optimistic forecast. Forecaster 3's introduction of 'confirmation lag' is particularly compelling; the question resolves based on the tracker's classification, not just the administration's actions. A volunteer-run tracker, especially one with high standards as Forecaster 2 suggests, may lag weeks behind real-world events. I also agree with their shared emphasis on the uncertainty created by the lack of current data. Forecaster 2's reasoning is slightly weakened by an incorrect assumption about the total number of objectives (they speculate 500-800, when the source indicates 2,137), which makes the 120-objective threshold seem much more difficult than it actually is (~5.6% of the total). Nonetheless, their qualitative points about high standards and the slow pace of government are valid. The consensus view is that the primary friction point may not be the administration's will, but the process of verification and classification by the tracker.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am revising my forecast downward. My initial forecast of 60% was too heavily weighted towards the design and intent of Project 2025 as a blueprint for rapid executive action. I underestimated the friction inherent in the resolution criteria, which depend entirely on the tracker's classification.\n\nThe arguments regarding 'confirmation lag' and the tracker's likely 'stringent criteria' are the primary drivers of my update. A policy may be implemented, but it is not 'Done' for the purposes of this question until a community of volunteers has verified the action and updated the website. This process introduces a significant delay and a higher bar for success than a simple press release or executive order signing. These factors substantially lower the probability of reaching the 120-objective threshold by the specified date.\n\nWhile I am lowering my forecast, I am not lowering it to the 30-35% range of my colleagues. The threshold of 120 represents only ~5.6% of the 2,137 total objectives. I maintain that a well-prepared administration could clear a large number of 'low-hanging fruit' objectives very early in its term. The sheer volume of possible targets provides many pathways to 120. However, the measurement friction is real and significant. Therefore, I am moving my forecast from 'likely' to 'slightly unlikely,' reflecting a near-even balance between the administration's capacity for rapid action and the tracker's capacity for rapid verification. My forecast moves from 60% to 45%.",
