  "information": "The current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is Brooke Rollins, who was sworn in around February 2025. Secretary Rollins has expressed support for SNAP reforms as part of a 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative, which is also championed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In legislative developments, the House Budget Committee has cleared a Republican spending package that includes proposed cuts to SNAP and stricter work requirements. Separately, Secretary Rollins plans to announce a USDA reorganization plan and further staff reductions in late May 2025.\n\nSeveral states are pursuing federal waivers to restrict the use of SNAP benefits for certain items. Nebraska became the first state to receive a waiver to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks, with the ban taking effect on January 1, 2026. Following this, Idaho submitted a similar waiver on May 16, 2025, to ban soft drinks and candy, with a decision expected in the coming weeks. Arkansas is seeking USDA clearance to make candy and soda ineligible starting in July 2026, while also proposing to add rotisserie chicken to the list of eligible foods. Indiana is also pursuing similar restrictions.\n\nChanges to national SNAP eligibility rules require either a congressional amendment to the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 or a formal USDA rulemaking process. The Act broadly authorizes SNAP benefits for 'any food or food product intended for human consumption.' In the past, the USDA has rejected state waiver requests to restrict specific food items due to concerns about implementation challenges, costs, and the potential impact on recipients. According to the USDA, approximately 20% of all SNAP spending goes towards sugary drinks and snacks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "As of May 2025, the USDA's 'What Can SNAP Buy?' page explicitly lists 'snack foods' as an eligible item. Therefore, the status quo outcome is 'Yes'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The new USDA Secretary, Brooke Rollins, as part of the 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative, directs the Food and Nutrition Service to make a quick, symbolic change to the website. They remove the explicit mention of 'snack foods' to signal a new policy direction, even before formal rulemaking or legislative changes are complete.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the new administration's public stance on SNAP reform, bureaucratic inertia and the focus on more substantial changes (like rulemaking, state waivers, and agency reorganization) mean that updating the text on a specific webpage is a low priority. The page remains unchanged by July 1, 2025, as the process for even minor policy-related textual updates in a federal agency takes longer than the available time.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong influence of bureaucratic inertia versus the short timeframe for the new administration to enact change. The resolution date is just six weeks away. While the political will to restrict certain SNAP purchases is clear from the new USDA Secretary and state-level waiver requests, implementing such changes, even cosmetically on a website, is typically a slow process within a federal agency. The provided information notes that state-level bans are not effective until 2026, which highlights the long timelines involved. A change to a national guidance page would likely require review from multiple departments, including policy and legal, to ensure it doesn't misrepresent the current law—the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008—which broadly defines eligible foods. The agency's focus is likely on larger, more formal processes like rulemaking, legislation, and its own reorganization, making a rapid change to a single webpage less probable.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 90% because a motivated political appointee could force a quick, symbolic change to the website to signal a new policy direction. Updating a webpage is technically simple, and it could be framed as an 'easy win'.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the status quo is a powerful force in government. The risk of creating public confusion by having a guidance page that does not accurately reflect the current law is a significant deterrent to making a hasty change. The default action for a bureaucracy in a six-week timeframe is no action.\n\nI would update my forecast towards 'No' if there were a specific public announcement from the USDA about immediate changes to online guidance. I would update towards 'Yes' if USDA officials publicly emphasized that any changes would only follow a full, formal rulemaking process.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is Brooke Rollins, who was sworn in around February 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
