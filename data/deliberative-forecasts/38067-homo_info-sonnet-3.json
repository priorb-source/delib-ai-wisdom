    "review": "Forecaster 3 introduces crucial new information: Cassie Piuma is confirmed as a finalist for Outstanding Chef. This is a game-changer. Forecaster 2 disputes my historical base rate (claiming 20-30% vs. my 40%), but the research assistant explicitly stated 'four times' in 'the last ten cycles,' which is 40%, so Forecaster 2 appears to have incorrect data. The key insight from Forecaster 3 is that knowing the specific composition of the finalist pool is far more informative than relying solely on historical averages. If there are typically 4-5 finalists and only one is a woman, this actually provides important constraining information that I lacked in my initial analysis.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast downward from 42% to 33% based on Forecaster 3's information about the finalist composition. Here's my reasoning: (1) The 40% historical base rate I cited may have included years with multiple women finalists, making it less directly applicable when we know there's specifically one woman among approximately 5 finalists. (2) Having one woman finalist among ~5 total represents 20% representation at the finalist stage, which is actually below the historical 40% win rate, suggesting this particular year's pool may be less favorable for a female winner than the historical average. (3) However, I'm not going as low as Forecaster 3's 25% because: (a) the historical 40% win rate demonstrates that when women reach finalist status, they have proven competitive, (b) the equity initiative has shown real institutional effects, and (c) Cassie Piuma's finalist status indicates she has substantial credentials. (4) This is not a random lottery - finalist status indicates genuine competitiveness, so while base rates matter, they should be adjusted for the specific competitive landscape. My 33% reflects a balance between the constrained information (one woman among ~5 finalists) and the demonstrated historical success rate of women in this category.",
