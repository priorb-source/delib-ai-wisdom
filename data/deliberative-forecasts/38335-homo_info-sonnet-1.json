    "review": "All three forecasts converge tightly in the 18-22% range, which increases my confidence that this probability range is reasonable. Forecaster 3 raised the most significant new information I hadn't considered: the House probe into Hope Florida foundation reported in late May/early June 2025. This creates substantial negative publicity that would give Casey DeSantis strong incentive to delay any announcement until the probe is resolved or subsides. This is a concrete factor pushing toward maintaining the status quo. Forecaster 3's point about the June 30 fundraising deadline as a potential catalyst is interesting but seems outweighed by the probe issue - candidates typically prefer to announce during positive news cycles, not during investigations. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the complete absence of visible campaign infrastructure (no fundraising filings, staff hires, or groundwork) reinforces the unlikely nature of a sudden announcement. Both forecasters correctly note the historical announcement window extends through December 2025, eliminating any urgency to announce in the next 26 days. Their reasoning on Trump's endorsement of Donalds and the polling dynamics aligns with my initial analysis.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection with additional information, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward. The House probe into Hope Florida is a significant factor I initially missed that creates strong disincentive for announcement during this period. Combined with: (1) zero visible campaign preparation with only 25 days remaining, (2) Trump's endorsement of Donalds creating political headwinds, (3) ample time remaining in the typical announcement window through December 2025, and (4) Ron DeSantis's notable silence on endorsing anyone including his wife, the status quo of no announcement is even more likely to persist. The fundraising deadline catalyst is insufficient to overcome these headwinds. My forecast moves from 20% to 18% to reflect the additional weight of the probe timing. This small adjustment reflects that while the probe information is significant, we were already in a very low probability range where the fundamentals strongly favor no announcement.",
