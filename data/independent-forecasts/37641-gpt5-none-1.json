    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "SEC review or NYSE listing approval takes longer than expected, the company postpones the roadshow/pricing due to adverse market or crypto-specific volatility, a late regulatory hiccup around stablecoins emerges, or Circle pivots to list on a different venue (e.g., Nasdaq) or after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Circle’s S-1 is declared effective, NYSE listing approval is finalized, the roadshow runs in June, the deal prices, and shares begin trading on the NYSE before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and setup: Public reporting (e.g., Forbes on Apr 4, 2025) frames Circle’s IPO as a marquee 2025 event, suggesting the listing process is well underway. Typically, once a company publicly files and signals a near-term listing plan, the remaining milestones (SEC effectiveness, exchange approval, roadshow, pricing) can fit within a several-week window if conditions are supportive. The specific resolution criterion requires trading on the NYSE before July 1, 2025.\n- Time constraint: With ~7 weeks left, there is sufficient time for a June roadshow and pricing, consistent with a Q2 listing. This supports a materially non-trivial chance of completion.\n- Base rates and risks: IPOs frequently slip for market or regulatory reasons, and crypto-adjacent firms carry added headline/regulatory risk. Even with a constructive equity window, short-term volatility in crypto or policy developments around stablecoins could push timing past July 1. Any delay of a few weeks would flip this market to No. There is also venue risk (if they list on a different exchange) and execution risk (SEC or exchange approval delays).\n- Why not higher: The outcome hinges on tight sequencing under a firm deadline. Minor delays in effectiveness, marketing, or pricing could miss the July 1 cutoff. Regulatory or market headlines specific to crypto/stablecoins could easily prompt deferral. These factors cap the probability below ~80%.\n- Why not lower: Credible reporting indicates Circle intends to go public in 2025 and (per public coverage) to list on the NYSE, with the IPO window open and investor appetite reasonably healthy. That makes a June listing plausible, keeping odds well above 50%.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information was provided; my estimate relies on the cited Forbes piece and standard IPO process/timelines.\n- What would move me up: SEC declares the S-1 effective; NYSE approval confirmed; announcement of roadshow launch and a proposed pricing window in June; strong order book indications; confirmation of NYSE ticker and listing date. \n- What would move me down: Reports of regulatory friction specific to stablecoins/Circle, deteriorating crypto or equity market conditions, an announced delay, silence on roadshow timing into late June, or credible reports of a non-NYSE venue.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Circle be publicly-traded before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nForbes: [The Circle IPO Solidifies 2025 As The Year Of Stablecoins](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/04/04/the-circle-ipo-solidifies-2025-as-the-year-of-stablecoin/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if shares of Circle Internet Group, Inc. are publicly traded on New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
