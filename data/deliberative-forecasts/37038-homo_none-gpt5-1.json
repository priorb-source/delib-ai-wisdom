    "review": "Both forecasters converge on the same core points I relied on: (1) very short runway, (2) Israel’s longstanding FTA preferences (often Free), (3) lack of any public/legal process pointing to an imminent Israel‑specific tariff, and (4) the unusual specificity of 17% for a broad measure. Forecaster 2’s 5% aligns closely with my priors. Forecaster 3’s 18% seems too high given the absence of concrete signals; the Times of Israel piece indicates concern but not actionable U.S. policy steps, and 17% remains an odd choice in U.S. practice unless one assumes a “VAT‑reciprocity” policy that would likely have clear advance signaling. A useful nuance both raise is that a suspended listing would still resolve Yes, and Forecaster 2 notes the (low) risk of a narrowly scoped IL‑specific 17% entry appearing in Chapter 99 or a subheading—an interpretive risk worth acknowledging but still unlikely without public notice.",
    "rationale": "Nothing material has surfaced to indicate an imminent HTS change assigning +17% to Israel. Creating such a measure would almost certainly involve a Presidential proclamation and Federal Register notice under established authorities (e.g., 301/232/IEEPA) and a USITC HTS update; with ~5 weeks left, the lack of any visible process is strongly dispositive. Politically, an Israel‑specific tariff would be a major move; if the intent were a broader reciprocal/VAT‑equalization framework, we would expect substantial advance signaling and likely round‑number rates. The resolution’s allowance for a suspended listing marginally raises tail risk, as does the theoretical possibility of a Chapter 99 additional duty keyed to Israel, but both would still require public action that is currently absent. I slightly nudge up my estimate to account for these tails and the remote chance of an interpretive quirk, but I still view a listing by June 1 as unlikely.",
