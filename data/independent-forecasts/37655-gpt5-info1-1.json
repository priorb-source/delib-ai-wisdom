  "information": "Under Ukrainian law, specifically Article 19 of the Law “On the Legal Regime of Martial Law,” scheduling or holding national elections is forbidden while martial law is in effect. On May 15, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) voted to prolong martial law and general mobilization until at least August 6, 2025. The parliamentary rules of procedure also stipulate that once martial law is lifted, the date for the next presidential election must be set no less than 90 days in advance.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Martial law remains in force through July 1, 2025, and no legal change is made. Because Ukrainian law forbids scheduling national elections while martial law is in effect, no authorized body sets or announces a specific presidential election date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before July 1, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada either (a) lifts martial law early and immediately passes a resolution setting a date at least 90 days out, or (b) amends the legal framework to permit scheduling during martial law and then formally sets a date (likely in autumn 2025). An authorized body (e.g., the Rada or the CEC) officially announces that date.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant notes that Ukrainian law prohibits scheduling or holding national elections under martial law. On May 15, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada extended martial law and general mobilization until at least August 6, 2025. Parliamentary rules also require that, once martial law is lifted, a presidential election date must be set with a minimum of 90 days' notice. Given this fresh extension to August 6—well past the July 1 resolution date—status quo strongly favors no announcement. Historically, Ukraine has repeatedly extended martial law during the full-scale war, and both logistical and legitimacy concerns (security, participation of soldiers and displaced persons, ability to campaign and observe) have weighed against wartime elections. For a Yes outcome, either an early lifting of martial law or a legal carve-out allowing scheduling during martial law would be required, followed by a formal resolution setting a specific date. Both would represent a significant policy shift within the next six weeks. This is possible but unlikely absent a dramatic change in the security situation, a political decision to pre-commit to an autumn election date, or strong external pressure paired with funding and security guarantees. The forecast is not higher because: the Rada just extended martial law to August 6; there is an explicit legal barrier to scheduling; and time is short. It is not lower than this because: parliament could, in principle, amend laws quickly or lift martial law early if conditions or political incentives change, and a commitment to a future date (e.g., October/November 2025) could be seen as beneficial domestically and internationally. I would move the probability up if there are credible reports of preparations to amend the martial-law election provisions, signals from top leadership about early lifting or a fixed autumn election timeline, or a ceasefire/major stabilization on the front. I would move it down toward near-zero if authorities reiterate that no election steps will be taken under martial law, or if the security situation deteriorates further.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine announce a presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Next Ukrainian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_presidential_election)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nUnder Ukrainian law, specifically Article 19 of the Law “On the Legal Regime of Martial Law,” scheduling or holding national elections is forbidden while martial law is in effect.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
