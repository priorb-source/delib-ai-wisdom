  "information": "A proposal to ban the 'Tush Push' play, initially submitted by the Green Bay Packers, was discussed at the NFL's annual meeting in early April 2025. The proposal was tabled after receiving support from 16 of the NFL's 32 teams, short of the 24 votes required to pass a rule change. The proposal is scheduled to be revisited at the spring league meeting on May 20-21, 2025, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "20 days until June 1, 2025, with the critical NFL spring league meeting scheduled for May 20-21, 2025 (8-9 days away)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - The Tush Push remains legal in the NFL",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At the May 20-21 spring meeting, the proposal either fails to receive the required 24 votes (maintaining around 16-20 votes in favor), gets tabled again for further discussion beyond June 1, or is withdrawn without a vote. Teams that initially opposed the ban maintain their position, and efforts to build consensus fall short of the 75% supermajority needed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Between now and the May 20-21 meeting, proponents successfully lobby at least 8 additional teams to support the ban. The proposal comes to a vote at the spring meeting and receives 24 or more votes, with the NFL officially announcing the rule change before June 1, 2025. Key swing teams are persuaded by arguments about player safety or competitive balance.",
    "rationale": "The proposal faces significant hurdles. At the April 2025 meeting, it received only 16 of 32 votes—exactly 50% support but well short of the 24 votes (75%) required for NFL rule changes. To pass at the May 20-21 meeting, supporters must gain 8 additional votes, representing a 50% increase in support within roughly one month. While CBS Sports reports 'strong support' could emerge, and the fact the proposal was tabled (rather than rejected outright) suggests ongoing viability, NFL history shows that achieving 75% consensus on contentious rule changes is difficult. The high vote threshold exists precisely to maintain stability and prevent hasty changes. The short timeframe between meetings limits how dramatically opinions can shift. Additionally, the Tush Push primarily benefits one team (Philadelphia Eagles) and doesn't pose obvious safety concerns that would drive urgent action. Status quo bias is strong in institutional settings like the NFL. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the 8-vote gap is substantial, (2) the one-month timeframe is brief for building consensus, and (3) no concrete evidence shows momentum beyond speculation. My forecast is not lower because: (1) the proposal is scheduled for reconsideration, (2) tabling suggests genuine deliberation rather than rejection, and (3) there are reports of growing support. I would update higher with reports of specific teams switching positions or formal statements from NFL leadership supporting the ban. I would update lower if key stakeholders publicly oppose it or if the meeting agenda indicates the vote will be postponed again.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Football League officially approves or announces a rule restricting the quarterback sneak known as the [Tush-Push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sneak#Tush_push) before June 1, 2025. If there are no reports of this occurring before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA proposal to ban the 'Tush Push' play, initially submitted by the Green Bay Packers, was discussed at the NFL's annual meeting in early April 2025. The proposal was tabled after receiving support from 16 of the NFL's 32 teams, short of the 24 votes required to pass a rule change.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
