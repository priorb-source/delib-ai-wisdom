    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "42 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the DV “Submit an Entry” instructions page remains live at the same URL.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The State Department restructures travel.state.gov before July 1, 2025, causing this specific URL to 404/410 or to redirect elsewhere; or a policy move eliminates/suspends the DV program and the page is removed rather than updated; or a site outage or maintenance window happens exactly when Metaculus attempts access and the page is not available at that URL.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The page remains accessible at the exact URL, showing the instructions (possibly with “entry closed” messaging outside the filing window) and is maintained continuously through and after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Base rate/status quo: U.S. government program pages on travel.state.gov are usually stable, and the Diversity Visa program has operated annually for decades despite periodic controversy. The instructions page typically persists year-round, even when the entry portal is closed, and URLs on travel.state.gov tend to be long-lived.\n- Short time horizon: Only six weeks remain until the resolution date, which strongly favors continuity. Site reorganizations or policy changes large enough to remove or relocate this page are unlikely on this timeframe.\n- Policy risk: Although the DV program has critics (e.g., past administration statements; litigation referenced in the background), ending it would likely require congressional action. Even with an administration that opposes DV, agencies often keep an informational page (possibly updated to reflect changes) at the same URL rather than delete it abruptly. This reduces the chance of a No outcome by policy alone before July 1.\n- Technical/website risk: The primary downside risks on this short horizon are (1) a CMS/content reorganization that changes the URL, (2) a hard redirect that Metaculus might not count as “at this location,” and (3) transient downtime coinciding with the access attempt. These are low-probability but non-trivial risks.\n- Research assistant report: No additional info was provided; thus I lean on general stability patterns of federal websites and the DV program’s historical persistence.\nWhy not higher: There remains a small but real chance of a URL change/redirect or a brief outage at the precise time of check, and a smaller chance of a sudden policy-driven content removal before the entry season updates.\nWhy not lower: The short horizon, institutional inertia, and the common practice of maintaining legacy URLs for high-traffic visa pages strongly support continuity.\nUpdate triggers:\n- Upward: Confirmation that the page is currently accessible at that URL and State has no pending site migration; public communications affirming the DV program’s continuation; evidence that State preserves existing URLs during content refreshes.\n- Downward: Announced or observed travel.state.gov restructuring, broken links/redirects appearing in the DV section, or credible reports of imminent DV program suspension/abolition before July 1; planned maintenance/outage window covering early July.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US State Department's Diversity Visa page still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | [Donald Trump's 2017 tweet discussing the DV program](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925684982307348480)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Step 1 Submit an Entry page with instructions for registering for the Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) Program is at [this location](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html) when attempted to be accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
