  "information": "As of the last filing for Q4 2024, Berkshire Hathaway held approximately 10.7 million shares of Amazon. For 10 consecutive quarters, the company has been a net seller of equities. In Q1 2025, Berkshire increased its cash reserves to a record of approximately $348 billion.

Following the announcement, a Stocktwits poll indicated that 46% of retail investors still view Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term 'buy', and retail sentiment on the stock was described as 'extremely bullish'.

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one week. The 13F filing for the quarter ending March 31, 2025, is due by May 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Berkshire Hathaway's last reported holding was 10.7 million shares of Amazon, which is above the 10 million share threshold. If no changes were made, the outcome would be Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway sells at least 700,001 shares of its Amazon stake during Q1 2025 as part of its broader strategy of reducing equity exposure and increasing cash reserves, bringing its total holdings to or below 10,000,000 shares.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite being a net seller of equities overall, Berkshire Hathaway's managers decide to maintain or only slightly trim their Amazon position, keeping the holding above 10,000,000 shares due to the company's strong long-term growth prospects, particularly in AWS.",
    "rationale": "The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the status quo. Berkshire Hathaway's last disclosed position was 10.7 million shares, providing a buffer of 700,000 shares above the 10 million threshold. For large institutional investors like Berkshire, inertia is a significant force, and maintaining existing positions is often the default action. The strong fundamental case for Amazon, evidenced by its AWS growth and positive analyst ratings, provides a clear reason to continue holding the stock. However, a significant counter-argument is Berkshire's consistent behavior as a net seller of equities for 10 consecutive quarters, coupled with its record-high cash position of $348 billion. This indicates a broad, strategic decision to reduce market exposure, likely due to valuation concerns. Trimming a relatively small portion of their Amazon stake (approximately 6.5%) to fall below the threshold would be consistent with this overarching strategy. My forecast is not higher because the persistent net-selling trend creates a substantial probability that the Amazon position was trimmed along with others. It is not lower because the status quo is a 'Yes,' and the position has a small buffer. A small trim, rather than a large one, is a more likely portfolio management action, which would still result in a 'Yes' outcome. I would increase my forecast if there were reports of Berkshire becoming more bullish on the market in Q1. I would decrease it if there were wider market turmoil in Q1 that would have likely prompted more aggressive selling from a cautious investor like Berkshire.",
