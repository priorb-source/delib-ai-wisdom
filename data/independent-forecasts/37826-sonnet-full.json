  "information": "Following a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir on April 22, 2025, which killed 26 tourists, the Indian government took several actions against Pakistan. These included suspending the Indus Water Treaty, closing the Attari-Wagah border, and banning the SAARC visa scheme for Pakistan. The Indian military launched 'Operation Sindoor' (also referred to as 'Operation Sundar'), a series of targeted strikes against what were described as terrorist camps in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Pakistan proper. Indian sources reported that over 100 terrorists were killed in these operations, including high-value targets. The operation targeted infrastructure linked to groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.\n\nAfter India's initial strikes, a period of military escalation occurred. The Indian Army reported that on the night of May 8-9, 2025, Pakistan launched multiple attacks using drones and missiles targeting military stations at Jammu, Pathankot, and Udhampur, and committed numerous ceasefire violations along the Line of Control. India stated that these threats were neutralized using kinetic and non-kinetic means with no casualties or material losses reported on the Indian side. India conducted retaliatory strikes, with reports claiming the destruction of a Pakistani post, a terrorist launch pad, and 11 Pakistani airbases. After several days of tension, a ceasefire was agreed upon on May 10, 2025, following direct talks between the two countries' Directors-General of Military Operations (DGMOs). Subsequently, Pakistani intelligence sources reported an agreement for both sides to withdraw troops to their pre-conflict positions by the end of May.\n\nIn the aftermath of the military engagements, India initiated a diplomatic offensive. The government dispatched seven all-party delegations to 32 countries for a diplomatic push scheduled between May 21 and June 5. These delegations were provided with 'talking points' and a 150-page dossier detailing India's position on cross-border terrorism. Politically, the Indian Prime Minister announced a new doctrine of 'no tolerance for terror that hides under nuclear blackmail'. In parallel, the Indian Army Chief, General Upendra Dwivedi, granted 'full authority' to the Western Commanders to retaliate with kinetic actions in response to any future violations of the ceasefire agreement by Pakistan.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days - 9 days until June begins, then 30 days through June 2025 to determine if any attacks occur in that month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The May 10 ceasefire agreement holds throughout June. Diplomatic efforts succeed in reducing tensions. The troop withdrawal to pre-conflict positions is completed by end of May as agreed. Pakistan avoids ceasefire violations and prevents cross-border terrorism. India maintains restraint despite the authority granted to commanders, focusing on diplomatic rather than military responses. Both nations prioritize de-escalation given the recent near-miss with wider conflict.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Pakistan commits significant ceasefire violations or another major terrorist attack occurs in late May or June. The Indian Western Commanders, acting under the 'full authority' granted by the Army Chief on May 22, order immediate kinetic retaliation against targets in Pakistan proper (Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces). Alternatively, intelligence indicates imminent attacks from Pakistani territory, prompting preemptive strikes under the 'no tolerance' doctrine announced by the Prime Minister.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No. A ceasefire was agreed just 12 days ago (May 10), both sides committed to troop withdrawals by end of May, and India is currently conducting a major diplomatic offensive through June 5. These indicate both countries stepped back from escalation and are attempting to consolidate positions through diplomacy rather than continued military action. Historically, ceasefires tend to hold at least initially after being freshly negotiated. However, several factors create meaningful risk of a Yes outcome: (1) The Army Chief's grant of 'full authority' to Western Commanders on May 22 - the very day being forecasted from - creates a hair-trigger response capability without requiring escalation through command chains; (2) The recent Operation Sindoor demonstrates India's willingness to strike Pakistan proper, not just Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, setting recent precedent; (3) Only 2 weeks have passed since active hostilities, meaning tensions remain extremely high; (4) The 'no tolerance' doctrine suggests India is predisposed to respond forcefully to provocations. The question's requirement of attacks specifically in Pakistan proper (the four named provinces) rather than just Pakistan-occupied Kashmir sets a higher bar. While India recently struck these areas in Operation Sindoor, repeating such strikes in June would require significant new provocation given the diplomatic phase currently underway. The forecast is not higher because: diplomatic efforts are active, the ceasefire was just agreed, international pressure favors restraint, and both sides showed willingness to step back. The forecast is not lower because: tensions remain extremely high, commanders have pre-authorized response authority, the conflict is very recent, and ceasefire violations could easily trigger the authorized kinetic response. For me to update higher, I would need: evidence of ceasefire violations, another terrorist incident, failure of diplomatic efforts, or intelligence suggesting Pakistan is preparing new attacks. To update lower: successful diplomatic progress, sustained calm along the border, or explicit Indian statements prioritizing restraint.",
