    "review": "Both forecasters add meaningful constraints I hadn’t explicitly incorporated. Forecaster 2 highlights party-process hurdles (missed PPP primary registration; leadership signaling he won’t be included) and a near-term resignation requirement, which—whether the exact date is May 4 or not—captures the key point that announcing would likely trigger immediate resignation/neutrality costs. Forecaster 3 adds polling headwinds and the 2017 Hwang Kyo-ahn precedent, strengthening the argument that acting heads avoid running. I find these points generally convincing and additive to my prior, though I treat the specific May 4 deadline with caution; the broader takeaway (high, imminent costs to announce) is solid. The counterpoints—PPP drafting chatter and elite pressure—sustain a nontrivial tail but don’t outweigh the institutional and political barriers in the next ~two weeks.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is short (~13 days), and Han’s public stance (“not yet decided”) plus no visible campaign buildout suggest inertia. Announcing before May 5 would likely compel immediate steps to preserve neutrality (potential resignation), which is a high-cost move while he is managing priority negotiations through April 24. The added frictions—PPP primary closure and leadership resistance to including him, caretaker norms reinforced by the 2017 precedent, and weak polling—reduce the incentive for a quick jump. A ‘Yes’ path exists but looks narrow: PPP would need to move to an emergency/‘draft’ mechanism, Han would need to accept and likely resign swiftly, and they’d have to do this despite his polling liabilities. The post–April 24 window is the obvious moment for any surge, but absent concrete signs (staffing, event scheduling, formal PPP rule-bending), the baseline remains ‘No.’ These added constraints push me down from my prior. I do not go to single digits because elite drafting talk, a potential need for a stability figure, and the possibility of a rapid, top-down PPP decision keep a tail risk alive over the next 10–12 days.",
