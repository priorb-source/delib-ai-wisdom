    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "EnergyStar.gov is currently online and functional. The status quo is that it will remain online.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following the announced plan to eliminate the Energy Star program, the EPA administration acts swiftly to decommission the program's assets. The energystar.gov domain and its servers are deliberately taken offline before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the announcement to eliminate the program, bureaucratic inertia, the technical process of decommissioning a major government website, or political/legal challenges delay the actual shutdown. As a result, the website remains online on July 1, 2025, even if the program itself is being wound down.",
    "rationale": "The primary evidence for a 'No' outcome is the strong, direct statement from an EPA director about eliminating the Energy Star program, as reported by The New York Times. This indicates a clear intention to shut it down. However, the status quo, which should be heavily weighted, is that the site is currently operational. A significant counterforce to the announced plan is bureaucratic inertia. Decommissioning a major federal website is not a trivial task; it requires planning, staff action, and a formal process. The timeline until the resolution date on July 1, 2025, is very short—less than two months. It is common for government programs and their assets to persist for months or even years after being slated for elimination. The cost of keeping the website online is likely negligible, while the act of taking it down requires dedicated effort. My forecast is not higher because the administration's stated intent is a very credible threat, and a politically motivated, top-down directive could accelerate the shutdown. My forecast is not lower because the short timeframe makes the 'Yes' outcome, driven by simple inertia, the more probable scenario. I would lower my forecast upon news of a specific shutdown date being set, but I would raise it if significant political or legal opposition emerges to delay the process.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
