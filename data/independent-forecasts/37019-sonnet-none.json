    "no_outcome_scenario": "Stapleton loses all 5 categories he's nominated in, with other artists winning in each category due to strong competition or voter preference for different artists this year.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Stapleton wins at least one of his 5 nominated categories, which is statistically likely given the multiple opportunities and his standing as a major country music artist.",
    "rationale": "Chris Stapleton has 5 nominations at the 60th ACM Awards, which represents a substantial number of opportunities to win. The question requires only that he win at least one award, not all or a majority. The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome for several reasons: First, mathematically, even with competitive categories, having 5 independent chances significantly increases the probability of at least one win. If we conservatively estimate a 25-30% chance per category, the probability of winning zero awards would be quite low (0.75^5 = 0.237, meaning 76% chance of at least one win). Second, Stapleton is an established, highly respected country artist with a strong track record at major awards shows. Artists with this level of recognition and multiple nominations typically win at least one award. Third, the base rate for multiply-nominated artists at major awards shows suggests that winning at least one is the norm rather than the exception. My forecast is not higher (90%+) because: voting outcomes can be unpredictable, we lack specific information about which categories he's nominated in and the competition level, and there's always variance in awards voting. My forecast is not lower (below 70%) because: 5 nominations provides substantial redundancy, Stapleton's reputation in country music is strong, and the mathematical probability strongly favors at least one win. I would update higher with: information about weak competition in his categories or strong pre-award predictions favoring him. I would update lower with: evidence of exceptionally strong competition across all his categories or unusual voting patterns this year.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chris Stapleton win an award at the 60th Academy of Country Music Awards?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe awards are scheduled to be held on May 8, 2025. Stapleton has 5 nominations.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Chris Stapleton wins an award at the [60th Academy of Country Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_Academy_of_Country_Music_Awards).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
