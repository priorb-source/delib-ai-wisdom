    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. The election is scheduled for May 1, 2025, with results expected within a day or two.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Conservative Party has held a significant majority on Derbyshire County Council since the last election in 2021, when they won 45 of the 64 seats. The status quo would see either the Conservatives or the Labour Party win the most seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative party loses its majority due to a national swing against them, but they still emerge as the largest single party. Alternatively, the Labour Party makes significant gains and wins the most seats. In this scenario, Reform UK may win a few seats by taking votes from the Conservatives, but not enough to become the largest party, as its vote is spread too thinly across the county.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "There is an unprecedented collapse in the Conservative vote, with the vast majority of those voters switching directly to Reform UK. This surge, combined with a fractured opposition vote between Labour and the Liberal Democrats, allows Reform UK candidates to win a large number of seats through the first-past-the-post system, making them the largest party on the council.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant structural barriers facing a challenger party like Reform UK in a local election. The status quo is a large Conservative majority (45 of 64 seats), which provides a substantial electoral buffer. While national polls show Reform UK performing well, translating a national protest vote into winning individual council wards is historically very difficult. Local elections are often influenced by incumbency, local campaign machinery, and name recognition, all of which heavily favor the established Conservative and Labour parties. Reform UK lacks this existing infrastructure. The first-past-the-post electoral system also presents a major hurdle; a party can achieve a high overall vote share but win very few seats if that vote is not geographically concentrated. The most probable outcome is that the election becomes a contest between the incumbent Conservatives and a resurgent Labour party, with Reform UK acting as a spoiler to the Conservatives and perhaps winning a handful of seats. My probability is not lower than 5% because the current political climate is highly volatile, and the BBC's report of an 'unusual' campaign suggests voter dissatisfaction with the main parties is high. A complete collapse of the Conservative vote could create an unpredictable result. I would increase my forecast if credible, ward-level polling for Derbyshire showed Reform UK leading in a sufficient number of seats to become the largest party. Conversely, I would decrease it if polling indicated the anti-Conservative swing was consolidating primarily behind the Labour party.",
