    "review": "The two other forecasters' analyses strongly align with my own initial assessment. We all identify the same primary drivers for an extremely low probability: the monumental difficulty of dismantling a federal agency, immense institutional inertia and political opposition, and the incredibly short timeline of roughly five months between a potential new administration's start and the resolution date. There is a clear consensus that the status quo outcome is the most likely. \n\nThe point raised by Forecaster 2, speculating that the spreadsheet maintainers will have a high bar for what constitutes 'complete' and would not mark the objective as such if an executive order were immediately tied up in court, is particularly compelling. This is a nuance I had considered but perhaps not weighted heavily enough. It narrows the already slim path to a 'Yes' resolution. The near-unanimous reasoning and the strong consensus on a lower probability (2% vs. my initial 5%) among my peers signals that my initial forecast may have been slightly too high.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast down from 5% to 2%. My initial reasoning remains the same, but the deliberation has convinced me to place more weight on the high standard the r/Keep_Track community is likely to apply for an objective to be marked 'complete'. As the other forecasters rightly argued, a new administration could issue a sweeping executive order to begin the process, but this action would be met with immediate and numerous legal challenges. Given that the trackers are a watchdog group, it is highly probable they would keep the status as 'in progress' while such legal battles play out, which would extend well past the July 1, 2025 deadline. The consensus of the other two expert forecasters reinforces my confidence in this conclusion. The path to a 'Yes' outcome requires not only a swift and radical executive action but also a specific and, in my view, unlikely interpretation of that action by the spreadsheet's maintainers. Therefore, a 1-in-50 chance (2%) feels more appropriate for this tail-risk event than my initial 1-in-20 (5%) estimate.",
