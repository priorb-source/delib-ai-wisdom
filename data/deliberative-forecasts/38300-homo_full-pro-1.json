    "review": "The other forecasters have provided analyses that are highly consistent with my own, reinforcing my confidence in the initial assessment. We all identify the same central tension: the strong, accelerating year-over-year (YoY) momentum and positive May PMI data are pulling towards a 'Yes' outcome, while the concerning forward-looking indicators like the sharp drop in the LEI and the decline in the core PPI suggest future weakness. No new evidence was presented that I hadn't already considered. The reasoning from both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 is convincing and aligns with my view that for a short-term (one month) forecast, the existing momentum and contemporaneous data should be weighted more heavily than longer-term leading indicators. The slight difference in probability (80% vs. 85%) reflects minor subjective differences in weighting the risks, not a fundamental disagreement on the facts or drivers.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other expert analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 85%. The deliberation process has reinforced my initial reasoning rather than altering it. All three of us converged on the same key factors: the significant positive momentum leading into May (+1.49% YoY in April) creates a substantial buffer, and positive contemporaneous manufacturing PMIs for May support continued growth. We also all identified the same primary risks: a sharp drop in the LEI, a decline in the core PPI, weakness in non-energy manufacturing, and a slowing global economy. \n\nI am not lowering my forecast to 80% because I believe the strength of the existing momentum is the most critical factor for this specific one-month forecast. A reversal from +1.49% YoY to negative would require a very significant month-over-month contraction, an event that the positive PMI data for May makes unlikely. The negative leading indicators (LEI, PPI) are more likely to signal a slowdown in the coming months (e.g., Q3 2025) rather than an abrupt reversal in the May data itself. Therefore, I believe an 85% probability appropriately balances the very strong tailwind from recent data against the credible but not yet realized risks.",
