    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Suarez continues signaling interest and fundraising via a political committee but holds off on a formal candidacy until later in 2025 (or decides against running), consistent with typical pacing for a 2026 cycle and ongoing uncertainty about the GOP field.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He schedules a rollout event and announces in mid-to-late June 2025, aiming to leverage end-of-June fundraising optics and to stake an early claim before other high-profile Republicans move.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: With only a few weeks left and no fresh signs of an imminent launch beyond the May 2 Axios item that he’s weighing a bid, the status quo favors no announcement before July 1. Most 2026 gubernatorial contenders in large states often wait until later in the off-year to formalize, especially when the field and endorsements are unsettled.\n- Incentives for a June announcement exist (e.g., end-of-month reporting optics and establishing early fundraising momentum), which keeps the probability above very low. But typically, imminent announcements are preceded by visible preparatory signals (personnel hires, a political committee ramping up, a scheduled event leak), none of which we have here.\n- Constraints/risks for Suarez: uncertain statewide viability after a brief 2023 presidential run, potential competition from higher-profile Republicans, and any lingering ethics/political headwinds—all of which can encourage a wait-and-see approach.\n- Research assistant: No additional information available. That absence of corroborating signals pushes weight onto the status quo (no announcement by June 30).\n- Why not higher: Short time window, lack of pre-announcement chatter, and common strategic reasons to delay. \n- Why not lower: The Axios report shows genuine consideration; a late-June, fundraising-timed announcement is plausible.\n- Update triggers upward: credible reports of a launch date, formation or ramp-up of a state political committee tied to a governor bid, key staff hires, venue holds, or donor invitations for a June event. \n- Update triggers downward: reports that he’s deferring a decision, backing another candidate, fundraising/ethics setbacks, or rising signs that major rivals will announce later, encouraging him to wait.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Francis Suarez announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Miami mayor weighs gubernatorial bid](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/02/florida-governor-miami-mayor-francis-suarez)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Francis Suarez announces his candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
