    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I initially underweighted: the resolution depends on what the HTS **displays**, not whether the tariff is actually enforced. This distinction is huge - suspension status is explicitly irrelevant, and legal challenges that block enforcement wouldn't necessarily change what's displayed in the HTS within the 5-week timeframe. This significantly narrows the paths to a No outcome. Forecaster 2's analysis aligns closely with my original reasoning about administrative willpower versus bureaucratic hurdles, but doesn't account for this display versus enforcement distinction. The specific reference to subheading 9903.01.60 in the question itself strongly suggests this is based on actual codified policy language rather than speculation - question writers don't typically invent specific technical subheading numbers. Once Chapter 99 entries are posted to the USITC system, they exhibit significant inertia over short horizons. The main remaining uncertainty is whether the 31% rate at this exact subheading has already been codified (which the 20-day-old NYT article and specific subheading reference suggest is likely) versus still being in process. A fast policy revision changing the percentage or moving Switzerland to a different 9903 subheading remains possible but would be unusual within 5 weeks for what appears to be a finalized action.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating upward based primarily on Forecaster 3's insight about the display criterion. The question resolves on what the HTS shows, not enforcement status. This means: (1) Legal challenges blocking enforcement don't trigger a No, (2) Suspension doesn't affect resolution, (3) Only actual policy changes removing/modifying the rate or moving it to different subheadings cause No. The 5-week timeline is very short for such administrative changes once codified. The specific subheading reference (9903.01.60) in the question strongly indicates this reflects actual codified policy, not speculation. My remaining uncertainty centers on: (a) whether it's already fully codified in the current HTS, and (b) the tail risk of administrative tweaks changing the exact percentage or subheading number during calibration of the new tariff program. However, the short timeline, typical HTS stability once posted, and political signaling value argue for persistence through June 1. I'm not going as high as 78% because I retain some uncertainty about current codification status that the other forecasters may be understating.",
