    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The company's cash reserves are insufficient to cover its burn rate, and without a significant cash infusion, its current trajectory leads to insolvency before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty successfully completes the sale of its Indiana farm asset during the second quarter of 2025, providing it with enough capital to fund its operations and meet its obligations beyond July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The planned sale of the Indiana farm is delayed beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline, or the deal falls through entirely. Lacking this critical cash infusion and unable to secure alternative financing, the company is forced to file for bankruptcy protection.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on AquaBounty's severe financial distress as detailed in its full-year 2024 results announced on March 27, 2025. The company ended 2024 with only $1.5 million in cash and equivalents, while its net cash used in operating activities for the year was $23.1 million. This high burn rate relative to cash on hand is unsustainable and prompted the company's auditors to issue a 'going concern' warning, signaling substantial doubt about its ability to continue operations. The company's survival in the short term is almost entirely dependent on a single event: the successful sale of its Indiana farm. Management has stated they have a signed purchase and sale agreement and expect it to close in Q2 2025 (which ends June 30, 2025). The status quo, without this sale, is insolvency. Therefore, the probability weighs heavily towards a 'Yes' outcome. The forecast is not higher because a signed purchase agreement is a significant de-risking event and indicates a clear path to avoiding bankruptcy, assuming the deal closes as planned. The forecast is not lower because the company has no margin for error. Any delay or complication in this single real estate transaction, which is common, would likely force a bankruptcy filing given their depleted cash position. I would increase my probability of bankruptcy upon any news suggesting the farm sale is delayed or has fallen through. I would significantly decrease my probability upon an official announcement that the sale has successfully closed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill AquaBounty Technologies file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[AquaBounty Technologies Announces Full Year 2024 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603978/000160397825000012/aqb-20250327xex99_1.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
