  "information": "Under Ukrainian law, specifically Article 19 of the Law “On the Legal Regime of Martial Law,” scheduling or holding national elections is forbidden while martial law is in effect. On May 15, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) voted to prolong martial law and general mobilization until at least August 6, 2025. The parliamentary rules of procedure also stipulate that once martial law is lifted, the date for the next presidential election must be set no less than 90 days in advance.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's office officially denied media reports suggesting that presidential elections were being planned for July 2025. Sources within the president's office and the Ukrainian government told BBC News Ukraine that no meetings had been held nor instructions given to prepare for elections, labeling the reports as 'fake or manipulative information.' President Zelensky has repeatedly stated that the question of holding elections can only be considered after the conflict is resolved.\n\nFormer President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced on February 16, 2025, that the next presidential elections will take place on October 26, 2025. He claimed his information came from multiple sources, including the Office of the President, law enforcement agencies, the Central Election Commission, and a printing plant which, he alleged, was already calculating the number of ballots required. This followed earlier reports in March 2025 from The Economist, which, citing anonymous sources in the Ukrainian government, had suggested President Zelensky was planning to announce a surprise election for July 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "45 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Martial law remains in effect as it was extended to August 6, 2025. The government maintains its stated position that elections cannot be held during wartime. The ongoing conflict continues without a major breakthrough, and no announcement is made by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A dramatic development occurs such as a ceasefire agreement or significant peace progress that allows martial law to be lifted early, enabling the government to announce elections. Alternatively, overwhelming international pressure or domestic political calculations lead to a policy reversal where the government announces elections despite martial law, either finding a legal workaround or changing the law.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors no announcement. Most critically, martial law was extended just yesterday (May 15, 2025) until at least August 6, 2025, demonstrating the government's current assessment of the security situation. Ukrainian law explicitly forbids elections during martial law, and even after it's lifted, elections must be scheduled at least 90 days in advance. With only 45 days until the resolution date, the timeline is extremely tight. The Ukrainian government has explicitly denied reports of planned elections, calling them 'fake or manipulative,' and Zelensky has consistently stated elections can only occur after the conflict ends. While Poroshenko claims elections will occur on October 26, 2025, this date is after the July 1 cutoff and comes from an opposition figure with potential political motivations. The structural barriers are substantial: active warfare, martial law just extended, legal prohibitions, and no apparent preparation for elections. For a 'Yes' outcome, we would need either: (1) an unexpected and rapid peace breakthrough leading to martial law being lifted soon, or (2) a dramatic government policy reversal under international pressure. My forecast is not lower (2-3%) because politics can be unpredictable and peace breakthroughs, while unlikely, are possible. There could be legitimate international pressure mounting for democratic renewal. My forecast is not higher (15%+) because of the timing: martial law was literally just extended yesterday, showing no current intention to move toward elections, and the 45-day window is very short for such a major policy shift.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nUnder Ukrainian law, specifically Article 19 of the Law “On the Legal Regime of Martial Law,” scheduling or holding national elections is forbidden while martial law is in effect.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
