    "review": "Both forecasters raise a compelling argument I underweighted: the question's extreme specificity (exactly 31%, specific subheading 9903.01.60) is itself strong evidence that these parameters come from actual policy announcements or official documents. If someone crafted this question with such precision, they likely had access to specific reporting or preliminary schedules. Forecaster 2's point about 'status quo bias' is particularly important - if 31% has already been formally announced or appears in preliminary documents, the question shifts from 'will this be implemented?' to 'will this remain unchanged until June 1?'\n\nHowever, I note that all three of us lack direct confirmation that 31% has been officially codified. We're inferring from the question's specificity rather than from verified documents. The NYT article headline mentions Switzerland in the 'top 10' but we don't have access to the article content to confirm the 31% rate.\n\nI also find Forecaster 3's emphasis on Switzerland's diplomatic leverage and the Trump administration's pattern of using tariffs as negotiating tools to be valid counterpoints that introduce uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too conservative in my initial forecast. The extremely specific nature of this question - requiring exactly 31%, exactly June 1, and exactly subheading 9903.01.60 - strongly suggests these parameters are drawn from actual policy documents or announcements rather than being arbitrary. Question designers typically don't choose such precise details randomly.\n\nThis specificity argument substantially increases my confidence that: (a) the 31% rate has been formally proposed or announced, and (b) the June 1 date is a stated implementation target. If these details are already in official documents or announcements, the base rate for them appearing in the harmonized tariff schedule on June 1 is considerably higher than I initially estimated.\n\nHowever, I remain cautious about going as high as 65% because: (1) 38 days still provides meaningful time for negotiations with Switzerland to modify terms, (2) The Trump administration has historically adjusted tariff rates during implementation, (3) Administrative or legal processes could create delays, (4) Each precision requirement (rate, date, classification) remains a potential failure point.\n\nBalancing the strong specificity evidence with remaining implementation uncertainties, I'm updating upward but staying below the higher forecasts. My revised estimate accounts for the likelihood that these details are already official while maintaining appropriate uncertainty about final implementation.",
