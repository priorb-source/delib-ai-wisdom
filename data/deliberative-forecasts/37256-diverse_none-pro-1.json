    "review": "The other forecasters and I agree on the fundamental analysis: the status quo, South Sudan's severe domestic challenges (political instability, weak institutions, security issues), and the lack of any affirmative evidence make a 'No' outcome highly likely within the short, sub-two-month timeframe. The primary point of divergence is the weight given to a potential, un-signaled last-minute push for ratification. Forecaster 3, in particular, made a compelling argument that I had previously understated: ratification could be pursued as a 'low-cost, symbolically valuable' political win for a government beset by crises. This provides a tangible motive for a sudden change in priorities. Both other forecasters assigned a higher probability than I did, suggesting I was too anchored on the overwhelming structural barriers and perhaps too dismissive of political opportunism.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 5% to 8%. The reasoning from the other forecasters, especially Forecaster 3's framing of ratification as a potential 'low-cost symbolic win', has convinced me that I underestimated a key potential motive for the government to act quickly. A positive international news story requiring little domestic capital could be appealing. This increases the probability of an attempt being made. However, I am only making a small adjustment. The formidable barriers that all three of us identified—the extremely short timeline, the multi-step bureaucratic process (parliament, presidency, deposit of instrument), and the country's profound institutional weakness amid ongoing crises—remain the dominant factors. The complete absence of any triggering evidence (e.g., a bill being tabled) means that a 'Yes' outcome depends on a series of low-probability events occurring perfectly and in quick succession. My updated forecast of 8% acknowledges the increased possibility of a politically motivated attempt but maintains that its successful completion before July 1st remains a significant long shot.",
