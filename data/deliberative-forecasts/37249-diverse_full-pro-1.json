    "review": "My initial forecast and those of the other two forecasters correctly identified the core tension of this question: Reform UK's strong momentum in individual polls versus the enormous gap they need to close in the slow-moving Politico poll-of-polls aggregate. However, the other forecasters brought two critical arguments that I had not sufficiently weighted. Forecaster 2 convincingly quantified the scale of the challenge, noting that for Reform to lead by 4 points, they likely need to reach ~34% support, a ~20 point swing which is historically rare in a stable democracy over such a short period. Forecaster 3 added a crucial mechanical point about poll aggregates: to move an *average* to a 4+ point lead, a sustained series of individual polls must show an even larger lead (e.g., 5-8 points). This 'overshoot' requirement makes the path to a 'Yes' outcome significantly more difficult than I first considered. Both arguments were highly persuasive and highlight the structural barriers that momentum alone may not overcome.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downwards from 22% to 16%. The other forecasters' analyses convinced me that I overweighted the compelling narrative of Reform's momentum and underweighted the stiff mathematical and structural requirements of the resolution criteria. The combination of needing a historically large 20-point swing in the aggregate (as highlighted by Forecaster 2) and the mechanical need for individual polls to consistently show leads significantly larger than 4 points to move that average (as highlighted by Forecaster 3) makes the hurdle much higher than I initially assessed. While the political environment is clearly volatile and a major electoral shock from today's local elections remains possible, this path to a 'Yes' outcome is extremely narrow. My revised forecast of 16% reflects this higher degree of difficulty. I remain slightly more optimistic than Forecaster 2 because I believe the unprecedented unpopularity of both major parties creates a uniquely fragile situation where a larger-than-normal swing is more plausible, but I have moderated my initial optimism based on the sound reasoning provided by my colleagues.",
