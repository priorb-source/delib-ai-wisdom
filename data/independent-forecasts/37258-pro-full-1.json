  "information": "A 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling established that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a legally binding independence referendum without the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster. The UK government has consistently denied requests for another referendum, a position reiterated by the UK Labour party. The previous independence referendum in 2014 was announced approximately two years before it was held, and precedent suggests constitutional changes require around 18 months of legal and administrative lead time.\n\nIn January 2025, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney described independence as an 'urgent priority'. However, former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated in the same month that a referendum was 'off the radar' for now and unlikely before the 2030s. More recent government announcements in April 2025 indicate a strategic focus on the economy, child poverty, and public services. The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has stated his party will not support an independence referendum during the next Holyrood term, regardless of the 2026 election outcome. The leader of the Alba Party, Kenny MacAskill, has suggested using the May 2026 Holyrood elections as a direct mandate for negotiating independence rather than holding a separate referendum.\n\nThe Scottish Government has issued guidance advising against significant or high-profile government announcements between May 15 and June 5, 2025, due to a by-election campaign in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency. Separately, tens of thousands of Scottish council workers are being balloted on strike action, with the vote closing on June 12. Public opinion polls on independence are mixed; while one poll showed an 11-point lead for 'Yes,' other sources from late April 2025 indicate polling remains in the 45-55% range against independence, with one citing 54% opposition.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Scottish government has not scheduled a referendum, and current political and legal conditions make an announcement unlikely.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish Government continues to focus on domestic policy priorities like the economy and public services, seeing the 2026 Holyrood elections as the next key milestone to build a mandate for independence. The UK government's opposition remains firm, and no official referendum date is announced before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing internal party pressure or seeking to capitalize on a UK political crisis, the First Minister makes a surprise tactical announcement of a consultative referendum date. This move would be designed to energize the independence movement and challenge Westminster's authority, even without a clear legal path to holding the vote.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly guided by three factors: legal precedent, political strategy, and timeline. Firstly, the 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling explicitly prevents the Scottish Parliament from unilaterally holding a legally binding referendum, and the UK government's position (shared by the Labour opposition) is firmly against granting the necessary authority. There is no viable legal path for an announcement. Secondly, the Scottish government's own recent actions indicate a strategic shift away from an imminent referendum. April 2025 announcements prioritized the economy and public services, and influential figures like Nicola Sturgeon have suggested a referendum is not on the immediate horizon. The SNP is more likely to focus its efforts on building a case for the 2026 Holyrood elections. Thirdly, the timeline is extremely short. With less than two months remaining, and a ban on major government announcements until June 5 due to a by-election, there is practically no time to lay the administrative and legislative groundwork that a referendum announcement would require. While public opinion polls are mixed, there is no sustained, overwhelming majority for independence that might force a change in strategy. My probability is not zero because a purely symbolic, non-binding referendum could be announced as a political tactic, as the question's criteria allows for an announcement even if deemed illegal by the UK. However, the probability is not higher because such a move would be a high-risk gamble with little immediate gain, running contrary to the current stated priorities and political focus of the Scottish government.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling established that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a legally binding independence referendum without the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster.
