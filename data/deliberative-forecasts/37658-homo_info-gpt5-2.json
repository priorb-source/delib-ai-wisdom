    "review": "Both forecasters added useful timing and process nuance. The most important new point is Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the 8‑K filing trigger and four‑business‑day window: this question resolves on the filing date, not the decision date, so a late‑June termination could still miss the July 1 cutoff. That clearly tilts odds down. I also agree with both that deal inertia is strong in national‑security reviews; parties often wait for formal outcomes, litigate, or pursue mitigation rather than terminate quickly. I share Forecaster 3’s read that the market spread reflects real risk but not an imminent collapse and that ally‑country buyers are less likely to face outright bans.\nWhere I’m cautious: Forecaster 2 mentions an already‑issued presidential block with delayed enforcement; that wasn’t in the RA summary and isn’t something I can verify here, so I don’t anchor to it. I also don’t overweight activist positions or vague reports of “progress”; they speak more to eventual outcomes than to a pre–July 1 termination filing. Net, their timing and disclosure arguments persuade me to shade my probability down from my prior estimate, but not as low as 20% given explicit presidential opposition and union/political pressure that could produce a decisive trigger in June.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~6 weeks. For a Yes resolution, we need not just an adverse CFIUS/presidential action but also a rapid decision by one party to terminate and an 8‑K filed before July 1. The most likely path in politically sensitive, allied‑country deals is continued negotiation or litigation rather than immediate abandonment. Even if a prohibition arrives in mid‑to‑late June, companies may evaluate options or the four‑business‑day 8‑K window could push the filing past July 1. There is meaningful upside risk to a swift termination if: (a) a clear presidential order hits by mid‑June and (b) boards choose to terminate promptly, but that’s a narrower corridor.\nPolitical headwinds (including the President’s stated opposition) and union resistance keep the near‑term collapse risk nontrivial. However, base rates for outright bans of Japanese acquirers are low, and both parties have incentives to explore mitigation or litigation. I therefore reduce my estimate to reflect the filing‑date nuance and process inertia.\nWhat would move me up: a public, unequivocal presidential prohibition by mid‑June; credible reporting that CFIUS has recommended a block; company guidance that they will terminate immediately upon such an order; evidence of a June outside date or termination right that will be exercised in June. What would move me down: credible reports of ongoing mitigation talks extending past July; statements affirming continued pursuit beyond July 1; court actions staying enforcement into July or later.",
