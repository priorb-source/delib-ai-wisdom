    "review": "I appreciate both forecasters' careful analyses. However, I noticed a critical error in Forecaster 2's reasoning: they state 'only 2 months have passed since Claude 3 (March 2024)' when in fact 14 months have elapsed (March 2024 to May 2025). This miscalculation led them to conclude that another numbered release seems 'premature,' when actually the 14-month gap supports the likelihood of a major release being imminent. Forecaster 3 correctly identifies this 14-month timeframe and notes it 'fits an extended but plausible cadence.' Both forecasters appropriately emphasize status quo bias and the tight 6-7 week window, which are valid concerns I had already considered but perhaps underweighted. Forecaster 3's point about companies frequently missing internal target dates is particularly relevant given the narrow timeline. The naming uncertainty remains the crux - all three of us agree this is the critical risk factor. I find Forecaster 3's analysis more rigorous than Forecaster 2's due to the timing error, and their 60% forecast may be slightly more appropriate given that the extended gap since Claude 3 actually supports rather than undermines an imminent release.",
    "rationale": "Correcting Forecaster 2's timing error strengthens the case for a near-term major release - the 14-month gap since Claude 3 is substantial and aligns with or exceeds Anthropic's historical cadence pattern. This makes the Neptune reports more credible as representing a true next-generation model. However, the fundamental uncertainties remain unchanged: (1) No explicit confirmation that Neptune equals Claude 4, (2) The strict naming requirement could easily fail if Anthropic chooses Claude 3.5, Neptune, or another designation, (3) The 45-day window leaves minimal margin for typical tech delays, and (4) Status quo bias remains relevant - most days pass without major product launches. The specific, credible Neptune reports with a late May/early June target remain the strongest evidence for YES, while the naming ambiguity and tight timeline are the strongest arguments for NO. I'm updating marginally upward from 50% to 52% primarily because the corrected 14-month timeline removes what appeared to be a concern (premature release) and actually supports readiness for a major launch. However, I'm not moving to 60% because the naming uncertainty is too substantial and the window too narrow for higher confidence.",
