  "information": "Somalia's National Communications Authority granted Starlink a full operating license in mid-April 2025, following approximately two and a half years of discussions. On April 13, 2025, Elon Musk announced on social media, \"Starlink is in Somalia.\" At a ceremony in Mogadishu, Starlink representatives stated the service would be available nationwide soon. Somali government officials, including the Minister of Communications and Technology, publicly welcomed the service, highlighting its potential to provide internet access across the country. As of mid-May 2025, the official Starlink availability map listed Somalia as \"Not Available\" or \"Coming Soon.\"\n\nThe time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming \"Available\" varies. For several African nations, the lag has been several months: Nigeria's service went live approximately four months after licensing in 2023, while Rwanda's took about four months. The median time for recent African launches has been estimated at 4–8 months. However, some rollouts have been much faster; for example, Bangladesh's service became available in about two weeks in May 2025. Conversely, some countries, such as Zambia, India, and Vietnam, have remained in a \"Coming Soon\" status for many months after receiving licenses.\n\nStarlink can provide service to Somalia without an in-country gateway station due to its use of inter-satellite laser links, which can connect to ground stations in neighboring countries like Kenya or Ethiopia. A report by the Washington Post indicated that the U.S. government has been diplomatically promoting Starlink's expansion in various countries, including Somalia. Local challenges in Somalia include a fragile security environment, complex import logistics for user terminals, and difficulties with payment processing infrastructure. According to 2022 World Bank data, about 30% of Somalia's 18 million people have internet access.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 47 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the Starlink map continues to show Somalia as Not Available/Coming Soon through June.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Licensing is done but commercial readiness lags: import/ customs and payment rails aren’t in place, no local reseller channel is announced, and Starlink keeps Somalia geofenced while it works through logistics and security concerns. Map remains Coming Soon past July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink leverages laser backhaul via Kenyan ground stations, flips geofencing, and opens ordering (possibly via a local partner) for at least part of Somalia. Following Musk’s April announcement and a government ceremony, Starlink updates the map to Available for some Somali regions before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence summary: Somalia granted Starlink a full operating license in mid-April 2025; Musk said “Starlink is in Somalia” on April 13. Officials and Starlink reps indicated nationwide service soon. As of mid-May, the map still shows Not Available/Coming Soon. Historically, several African rollouts took about four months (e.g., Nigeria, Rwanda), with a broader 4–8 month median. Some have been much faster (Bangladesh ~2 weeks in May 2025). Others have remained Coming Soon for many months (e.g., Zambia, India, Vietnam). Starlink can serve Somalia without an in-country gateway via laser links; challenges include security, terminal imports, and payments. \n- Status quo weight: The base rate for African launches turning to Available within ~2.5 months of licensing is low; typical lags are longer. If nothing changes, the most likely outcome by July 1 is No. \n- Reasons for higher-than-base probability: (1) License is already granted and Elon publicly committed; (2) technical feasibility via inter-satellite links and nearby ground stations (e.g., Kenya) reduces infrastructure bottlenecks; (3) 2025 cadence suggests faster activations are possible; (4) possible diplomatic tailwinds. \n- Reasons against a higher forecast: (1) African precedent points to multi‑month operational ramp after licensing, driven by import logistics, payment enablement, and partner setup; (2) Somalia’s security and customs environment could slow shipments and deter an “Available” flip until fulfillment is viable; (3) as of mid-May there is no public evidence of ordering enabled or a reseller launch, and the map still hasn’t moved despite a month since licensing. \n- What would move me up: credible reports of Somali ordering opening, a local distributor agreement, Starlink tweeting “service now available in Somalia,” or the map shade change for any Somali region. \n- What would move me down: indications of regulatory friction with regional authorities, payment-block issues, import delays for kits, or Starlink placing Somalia into a longer “Coming Soon” queue with stated later quarters.\nOverall: fast activation is plausible but not the base case within the remaining ~6–7 weeks. I assign a moderately low but material chance that Starlink flips the map to Available somewhere in Somalia before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Somalia as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Musk announces Starlink license for Somalia](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Musk_announces_Starlink_license_for_Somalia_999.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
