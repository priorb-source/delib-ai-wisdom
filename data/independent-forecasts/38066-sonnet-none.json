    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The event takes place June 16-17, 2025, which is approximately 20 days away. The question will definitively resolve by July 1, 2025, which is about 35 days from now.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - they speak at separate times without sharing the stage",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sam Altman and Elon Musk both deliver their talks at different time slots during the conference, as is typical for headline speakers. Given their ongoing legal disputes and professional tensions, Y Combinator schedules them separately to avoid potential conflict and ensure both speakers are comfortable participating.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Y Combinator organizes a special panel discussion or moderated conversation bringing both figures on stage simultaneously, either as an attempt at public reconciliation, to discuss the future of AI with contrasting perspectives, or as a high-profile publicity moment for the conference.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires weighing several competing factors. On one hand, both individuals are confirmed speakers at the same event, which creates the possibility of a joint appearance. On the other hand, the substantial tensions between them make this unlikely. Sam Altman and Elon Musk are currently involved in legal disputes, with Musk having sued OpenAI and Altman over allegations about abandoning the non-profit mission. Musk's xAI now competes directly with OpenAI. These dynamics create strong incentives for both parties to avoid sharing a stage. Conference logistics also favor the status quo: headline speakers typically receive separate time slots to maximize their individual impact and attendance. Without any announcement or evidence suggesting a joint appearance is planned, the default assumption should be separate speaking engagements. My forecast is not lower because: (1) Y Combinator has strong relationships with both individuals, particularly Altman who led YC from 2014-2019, giving them potential leverage to organize something unprecedented; (2) a reconciliation moment or joint discussion could generate significant publicity for the event; (3) the specific event format hasn't been fully detailed. My forecast is not higher because: (1) no evidence exists of planned joint appearances; (2) active litigation and public feuding make both parties likely to refuse such arrangements; (3) historical precedent shows these figures avoiding shared platforms despite attending similar events. I would update upward with any announcement of a joint session, evidence of reconciliation, or details about panel formats. I would update downward if either speaker cancels or if the detailed schedule shows clearly separated time slots.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
