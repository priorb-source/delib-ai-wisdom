    "review": "There is a strong consensus among all three forecasters, with each arriving at a 90% probability. The reasoning is highly convergent, focusing on the powerful combination of precedent (Zelenskyy's attendance at the 2023 and 2024 summits) and profound strategic necessity (securing critical aid and maintaining diplomatic momentum). The other forecasters did not introduce any game-changing evidence, but they did provide helpful nuances that reinforce the original assessment. For example, Forecaster 2 explicitly mentioned a potential health issue, and Forecaster 3 noted that a major aid package announcement could further compel attendance. These points are valid and fit well within the 10% uncertainty I had already allocated for low-probability, high-impact events. Their analyses are convincing and serve to strengthen confidence in the initial forecast rather than challenge it.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 90%. The deliberation with other experts has solidified my initial reasoning. The consensus confirms that the key drivers are clear and point strongly towards attendance. The core argument remains unchanged: President Zelenskyy has an overwhelming strategic motivation to attend this summit, which represents his most important diplomatic audience. He has established a clear precedent of in-person attendance at previous G7 meetings, and the security and logistical hurdles, while significant, have proven manageable in the past. The 10% probability of non-attendance remains an appropriate allocation to account for the irreducible 'fog of war' risks, such as a sudden, severe battlefield crisis or a specific, credible security threat that would make travel impossible. The arguments from the other forecasters reinforce this view without providing a compelling reason to move the forecast higher or lower.",
