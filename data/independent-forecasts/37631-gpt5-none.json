    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (roughly 33–35 trading days) until the close on Friday, June 27, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Walmart likely already has a slightly higher market cap than Tesla as of mid-May 2025; if that persists, the question resolves Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tesla mounts a sharp rebound (e.g., +15% to +30%) on positive catalysts such as upbeat commentary at its June shareholder meeting, autonomy/robotaxi or Optimus headlines, China/FSD progress, or a growth-led market rally, while Walmart is flat or modestly down; Tesla’s market cap exceeds Walmart’s at the June 27 close per CompaniesMarketCap.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Recent trends continue: Tesla remains under pressure from weak deliveries/margins, China competition, or negative sentiment; Walmart posts solid earnings/guidance (mid-May) and benefits from defensive retail positioning. Even modest Tesla volatility doesn’t close the gap, and Walmart’s market cap stays above Tesla’s at the June 27 close on CompaniesMarketCap.",
    "rationale": "Time horizon is short, so the current ordering matters a lot. Tesla’s market cap has fallen substantially in 2025 (as reflected in the Business Insider/JPMorgan note), while Walmart has been relatively strong. My base case is that Walmart is already slightly ahead or roughly neck-and-neck with Tesla in mid-May 2025. If Walmart is ahead by a mid–single-digit to low–double-digit percent, the probability it remains ahead over ~45 days is materially above 50%, given Tesla’s high volatility versus Walmart’s lower volatility. As a rough volatility-based frame: over this horizon, Tesla’s price could have ~20% standard deviation versus ~7% for Walmart; if Walmart’s current edge is ~5–10%, the chance it persists is around the low-to-mid 60% range absent strong directional catalysts.\n\nWhy not higher? Tesla’s upside volatility and the potential for sentiment/catalyst-driven rebounds (shareholder meeting headlines, autonomy narratives, macro growth rallies) keep the odds meaningfully below 70%. A single strong Tesla week can swing the ranking.\n\nWhy not lower? The short timeline and recent relative trend (Tesla weakness vs. Walmart resilience) mildly favor persistence. Additionally, Walmart has an imminent earnings event (mid-May) that could widen the gap if positive, while Tesla’s next hard catalyst (Q2 deliveries) comes after June 27.\n\nWhat would move me up: Confirmation that Walmart’s market cap currently exceeds Tesla’s by a clear margin (e.g., >$50–$80B on CompaniesMarketCap); a strong Walmart earnings beat and guidance that lifts shares; further Tesla negatives (margin compression, demand/price cuts, regulatory setbacks) that push Tesla lower.\n\nWhat would move me down: Evidence Tesla already exceeds Walmart today by a meaningful margin; a powerful Tesla rally tied to autonomy/AI or China/FSD progress; broad growth-factor outperformance vs. defensives; clear, positive surprises at Tesla’s June shareholder meeting.\n\nResearch assistant summary: No additional information was provided beyond the Business Insider/JPMorgan context indicating Tesla’s notable decline in 2025.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
