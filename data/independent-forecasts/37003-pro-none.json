    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 months. The election is scheduled for Autumn 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) wins the most seats, continuing its uninterrupted streak as the largest party in Vienna since 1945.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Freedom Party (FPÖ) successfully translates its national polling strength to the state level, surpassing the SPÖ due to voter dissatisfaction with the incumbents and a fractured left-wing vote, thus winning a plurality of seats for the first time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite a close race and a national surge by the FPÖ, the SPÖ leverages its strong local party organization, the popularity of incumbent Mayor Michael Ludwig, and a successful campaign to mobilize its base, securing a narrow victory and a plurality of seats.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the tension between a powerful historical precedent and recent, contradictory polling data. The status quo strongly favors the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ), which has been the largest party in Vienna in every election since World War II. This historical dominance, or base rate, suggests a high probability of a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nHowever, this must be weighed against current polling. The provided IFDD poll from March 24, 2025, shows a dramatic shift, placing the SPÖ at 28% and the right-wing Freedom Party (FPÖ) at 27%. This is a statistical tie and represents a massive drop for the SPÖ from their 41.6% in the 2020 election and an equally large surge for the FPÖ from their 7.1%. This single poll fundamentally reframes the election from a likely SPÖ victory to a toss-up.\n\nMy probability of 55% leans slightly towards 'Yes' for a few key reasons. First, the SPÖ possesses a formidable incumbency advantage and a powerful get-out-the-vote machine in Vienna, which can be decisive in a close election. Second, as a single poll taken several months before the election, it may not be fully predictive, and the SPÖ has time and resources to mount a comeback. \n\nThe probability is not higher because the polling data cannot be ignored. The FPÖ's momentum is consistent with national trends in Austria, suggesting the threat is very real. An FPÖ victory would no longer be a major surprise.\n\nThe probability is not lower because the SPÖ's historical resilience in 'Red Vienna' provides them with a stable floor of support, and dethroning such a long-standing incumbent is a significant challenge for any opposition party.\n\nI would increase my forecast if subsequent polls show the SPÖ re-establishing a clear lead. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if more polls confirm a statistical tie or an FPÖ lead, or if a major scandal were to impact the Viennese SPÖ.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Social Democratic Party of Austria win the most seats in the 2025 Viennese state election?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee for example election polls at [Vienna: Poll by IFDD from 24.03.2025](https://politpro.eu/en/austria/polls/63413/ifdd/2025-03-24)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Social Democratic Party of Austria wins a plurality of seats in the [2025 Viennese state election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Viennese_state_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
