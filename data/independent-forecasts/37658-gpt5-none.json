    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the deal remains pending without an 8-K termination filing by either party before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Regulatory review (especially CFIUS) continues or the parties agree to extend the outside date; there is no presidential block or unacceptable mitigation package before July 1, so no 8-K announcing termination is filed by either company.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "CFIUS recommends, and the President orders, a block; or mitigation demands are deemed unacceptable, prompting one side to terminate; or a contractual outside date hits and the parties elect not to extend — in any of these cases U.S. Steel (or Nippon Steel, if applicable) files an 8-K announcing termination before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: As of today, no 8-K termination has been filed. Most cross-border deals that reach this stage tend to either close after mitigation or continue pending review; outright terminations within a short window are less common, especially with an acquirer from a close ally (Japan). The most likely near-term path is continued review/negotiation or an extension — both resolve this question as No.\n- Political/regulatory risk: The deal is politically sensitive (strategic industry, union opposition, prior bipartisan criticism). That creates real tail risk of a presidential block or an unacceptable mitigation package. If such a decision lands in the next six weeks, the parties would likely terminate promptly and file an 8-K, resolving Yes. However, Japanese ownership (versus a rival nation) and the ability to craft mitigation agreements typically reduce the odds of an outright block versus a conditioned approval.\n- Timing mechanics: The question resolves Yes only if there is a formal 8-K termination before July 1. Even if the deal is in limbo, delay alone yields a No. Unless the contract’s outside date falls before July 1 and the parties refuse to extend, or a block is issued imminently, termination in the next ~6 weeks is less likely than not.\n- Incentives/fees: With significant deal-specific investments and likely termination fees, both sides have incentives to seek extensions and mitigation rather than walk quickly.\n- Why not higher: Ally-country acquirer, common use of mitigation in sensitive deals, and the short time window all lower the chance of a near-term collapse.\n- Why not lower: The industry’s strategic salience, union pressure, and prior political opposition create a nontrivial chance of a decisive block or an unacceptable mitigation term arriving soon.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports/leaks that CFIUS has recommended a block; White House signaling intent to prohibit; disclosure of a near-term outside date before July 1 with indications the parties won’t extend; news of financing or covenant breaches prompting termination. \n- What would move me down: Reports of CFIUS clearance or acceptance of a mitigation agreement; public statements from the Administration signaling comfort; formal extension of the outside date well past July 1; joint statements reaffirming commitment and progress on conditions.\n- Research assistant info: None beyond the question text; no new public updates incorporated here.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Steel/Nippon Steel merger collapse before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_U.S._Steel_by_Nippon_Steel)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, either U.S. Steel or Nippon Steel files an SEC Form 8-K announcing the merger agreement's termination or abandonment.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
