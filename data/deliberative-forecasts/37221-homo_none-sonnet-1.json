    "review": "All three forecasters have independently converged on remarkably similar analyses and forecasts (35-38%). We all identified the same key factors: the February downward revisions indicating disinflationary momentum, the 2.2% threshold being only 20 basis points above the ECB's 2% target, the lack of March/April preliminary data, and the inherent monthly volatility in inflation readings. Forecaster 2 usefully emphasized energy price volatility as a specific driver of monthly fluctuations. Forecaster 3 appropriately highlighted the ECB's demonstrated success in bringing inflation down from peaks. However, neither forecaster introduced fundamentally new evidence or arguments that I hadn't already considered in my original analysis. The update conditions they specified (energy shocks, wage data, preliminary estimates) mirror my own thinking. The tight clustering of our forecasts around 36-38% suggests we're all interpreting the limited available information similarly and that this range is well-calibrated given the circumstances.",
    "rationale": "The convergence of three independent analyses on nearly identical forecasts (35-38%) without any new hard evidence validates my original reasoning. The disinflationary trend evidenced by February's downward revisions remains the strongest signal. The 2.2% threshold is close enough to the 2% target that normal volatility could push the reading above it, but the trend suggests it's more likely to come in at or below target. No forecaster presented information about March 2025 data, energy price movements in April, or preliminary flash estimates that would change the analysis. The fact that Forecaster 3 weighted the disinflationary trend slightly more heavily (arriving at 35%) versus Forecaster 2 and myself (38%) represents normal forecaster variance rather than a compelling reason to update. My original forecast already appropriately balanced the downward trend against the proximity of the threshold and monthly volatility. Without new evidence, updating would simply be anchoring to others rather than responding to information.",
