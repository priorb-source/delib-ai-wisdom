    "review": "All three forecasts correctly identify the extremely short timeline and the high procedural hurdles as the dominant factors. My reasoning aligns very closely with Forecaster 3, who provides a detailed and convincing legal analysis of the process, including the high bar set by the failed NPD ban and the rarity of party bans in German history. This reinforces my initial assessment. Forecaster 2 arrives at a higher probability of 4%, citing the existence of a cross-party motion as a key factor. I find this reasoning less convincing, as it overweights the significance of an initial political maneuver and does not adequately address how this overcomes the subsequent, time-consuming, and independent judicial process at the Federal Constitutional Court, which is the primary bottleneck.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast. My initial reasoning is strongly reinforced, particularly by Forecaster 3. The central, unassailable argument is the timeline. The German legal process for banning a political party is intentionally long and arduous, historically taking several years. The idea that the Bundestag could formally apply, the Federal Constitutional Court could accept the case, conduct a full evidentiary review, hold hearings, deliberate, and issue a final ruling to ban the party—all in less than two months—is without precedent and strains credulity. The high legal standard established in the 2017 NPD case, where the court declined to ban a party it deemed unconstitutional, further illustrates the difficulty. The AfD's significant public support (polling at 25-26%) adds a major political barrier, as banning such a popular party would risk a major democratic crisis. While an extreme 'black swan' event could theoretically accelerate the process, there is no evidence to suggest this is likely. Therefore, the overwhelmingly probable outcome remains 'No'.",
