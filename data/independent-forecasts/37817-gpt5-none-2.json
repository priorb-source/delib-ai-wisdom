    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (Koror currently appears to have around 3–5 scheduled nonstop destinations; exceeding 5 would require at least six)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Existing routes (e.g., Guam, Yap, Taipei, possibly Seoul) persist with no additional scheduled destinations added or listed on FlightsFrom by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Multiple new or resumed scheduled routes are listed by July 1, such as the simultaneous addition of Japan (e.g., Tokyo/Osaka) and the Philippines (e.g., Manila/Clark) or additional South Korea routes, bringing the total to six or more destinations on FlightsFrom.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/status quo: Palau’s post-pandemic air service has been slow to recover, per the Marketplace article (Apr 2024). ROR has typically maintained a small set of routes (very likely Guam and Yap via United, Taipei via China Airlines; Seoul may or may not be regularly scheduled). That likely totals 3–4, sometimes up to 5 in peak periods. The resolution threshold requires >5 (i.e., at least 6), which is a high bar for a small market with limited carriers.\n- Time constraints: With roughly six weeks left, new routes needed to push the count to six usually require prior announcement, coordination, and sales lead time. While summer seasonal adds are possible, getting two or more additional destinations listed by July 1 is non-trivial.\n- Market dynamics: Palau relies heavily on Taiwan, Japan, and Korea source markets. Korea demand has lagged; Chinese routes remain unlikely due to geopolitical factors. Japan and Philippines services are plausible candidates, but both would likely need concrete, public announcements to be in the schedules by July 1.\n- Why not higher: To resolve Yes, at least two additional destinations beyond the usual 3–4 need to be scheduled and listed. Given the slow recovery and short runway to July, that seems unlikely.\n- Why not lower: There is some chance of late-breaking summer seasonal resumptions (e.g., Japan and/or Philippines) being listed on FlightsFrom, especially if agreements have been in the works. Even one new Japan route plus a Philippines route could tip it over.\n- Research assistant input: None provided beyond the background link; no new route announcements surfaced here.\n- What would change my view upward: Credible announcements (airline press releases, schedule filings, GDS listings) of at least two of the following starting by early July: Tokyo/Osaka, Manila/Clark, additional Korea city, or other regional additions (e.g., Hong Kong). FlightsFrom reflecting these routes prior to July 1 would also move me up.\n- What would change my view downward: Evidence that current marginal routes (e.g., Seoul or Taipei) are cut or paused for summer, or that United reduces Micronesia operations affecting Yap/Guam listings; or explicit confirmation that no additional routes will operate in July.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 5 direct flight destinations from Koror, Palau on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMarketplace: [Why hasn’t tourism recovered in Palau? Flights haven’t restarted in high volume since the pandemic drop-off, and South Koreans are booking their vacations elsewhere.](https://www.marketplace.org/story/2024/04/19/palau-tourism)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 5 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Koror (ROR)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/ROR) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
