  "information": "Airlines increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025. Jet2.com announced it would offer 1.6 million seats for the summer season, an 8% increase from 2024, with new routes from Bournemouth and London-Luton starting in April. Vueling offered over 145,000 seats to and from the islands for the Easter period, a 10% increase from the previous year. Air Nostrum increased its seat offerings by 7% for the same period. Binter also launched new routes from Córdoba to Gran Canaria starting in mid-April 2025.\n\nPassenger arrival data for the Canary Islands showed year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2025. AENA reported that traffic in the Canary Islands grew by 3.6% in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024. Monthly data showed a 2.2% increase in February and another 2.2% increase in March compared to the same months in 2024. The Easter holiday period in 2025 fell entirely within April, whereas in 2024, it was in late March.\n\nOn April 28, 2025, a massive power outage occurred on the Iberian Peninsula, affecting mainland Spain and Portugal. While the Canary Islands' power grid was not directly hit, the event caused significant disruptions to air travel. Reports indicated that air traffic at major hubs was operating at reduced capacity, leading to widespread flight delays and cancellations. Canary Islands airports experienced knock-on effects, with numerous flights connecting to the mainland being cancelled or delayed. One government official stated that 344 out of 6,000 scheduled flights in Spain were cancelled on that day.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5–6 weeks (April 2025 figures expected in early June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — arrivals continue to grow year over year, in line with recent AENA trends and added airline capacity",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Seat growth from Jet2, Vueling, Air Nostrum and Binter materializes; Easter falling entirely in April 2025 boosts demand; the Apr 28 outage trims only a small share of monthly arrivals. April 2025 ends up modestly above April 2024.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Apr 28 Iberian grid outage causes outsized cancellations and multi‑day knock‑on effects specifically on Canary routes, compounded by any additional late‑April disruptions (e.g., ATC issues, calima, or airline labor problems) and weaker load factors on the new capacity. April 2025 finishes slightly below April 2024.",
    "rationale": "Anchor on the status quo: AENA reports show the Canary Islands grew Q1 2025 passenger traffic by 3.6% YoY, with February and March each up roughly 2.2%. Airlines signaled added capacity into spring/summer 2025: Jet2 seats +8% with new April routes, Vueling +10% seats over Easter, Air Nostrum +7%, and Binter adding a mid‑April route. Importantly, Easter 2025 fell entirely in April, whereas in 2024 it was in late March; this calendar shift typically lifts April arrivals versus the prior year.\n\nCountervailing risk: The Apr 28 Iberian Peninsula blackout disrupted Spain’s air traffic (about 344 of 6,000 flights canceled that day). Canary airports saw knock‑on disruptions via mainland hubs. However, this was one day near month‑end. Even if Canary‑bound cancellations and delays depressed arrivals by, say, 5,000–15,000 passengers across 1–2 days, that is small relative to monthly arrivals on the order of ~2 million. The Easter shift plus capacity increases plausibly adds far more than that to April totals. The referenced concerns about US tourism are likely marginal here, as US visitors are a small share of Canary arrivals.\n\nWhy not lower than my forecast (i.e., why not single‑digit probability)? Because the outage creates some genuine downside tail, and added capacity does not guarantee load factors. Any concurrent late‑April shocks (ATC/strike/weather) could compound losses.\n\nWhy not higher? The weight of evidence—positive Q1 trend, explicit seat growth, and the Easter‑into‑April timing—leans clearly toward April 2025 exceeding April 2024. A one‑day shock is unlikely to negate those positives.\n\nWhat would move me upward (toward Yes): credible reports that the outage led to disproportionately high cancellations on Canary routes over multiple days; evidence of additional disruptions (e.g., strikes, severe calima) in Apr 29–30; or data indicating April 2024 was unusually high versus trend.\n\nWhat would move me downward (toward No): airline load‑factor or airport data indicating strong Easter volumes; preliminary AENA/Tourism Research April tallies suggesting mid‑single‑digit YoY growth; or confirmation that cancellations affecting the Canaries were limited.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAirlines increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025.
