  "information": "Historical data on FATF plenaries shows consistent changes to the grey list. Since the current monitoring process was adopted in 2018, there have been 17 plenary meetings up to February 2025. Of these 17 meetings, only one—the October 2020 plenary—concluded without any additions or removals. That session was a virtual meeting delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and was noted to have focused on policy work rather than country evaluations. For a country to be removed, it must complete its action plan and then undergo a successful on-site visit to verify the implementation of reforms.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-4 weeks. The FATF June 2025 plenary typically occurs in mid-to-late June, with results announced shortly after the meeting concludes.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - changes are made to the grey list. The overwhelming historical pattern shows that changes occur at nearly every plenary meeting.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The June 2025 plenary concludes with no jurisdictions added or removed from the grey list. This could occur if no countries have completed their action plans and on-site verification visits in time, no new countries are identified for increased monitoring, or if the plenary focuses primarily on policy discussions rather than country evaluations, similar to the exceptional October 2020 virtual meeting.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one jurisdiction is either added to or removed from the grey list following the June 2025 plenary. This could happen through one or more countries successfully completing their action plans and verification visits (likely candidates from the current 25 jurisdictions), or through new countries being identified as requiring increased monitoring based on FATF mutual evaluations and assessments.",
    "rationale": "The historical evidence strongly favors changes occurring. Since 2018, 16 out of 17 FATF plenaries (94%) have resulted in modifications to the grey list. The single exception was October 2020, which occurred during COVID-19 as a virtual meeting with noted focus on policy rather than country evaluations - circumstances that do not appear applicable to June 2025. The February 2025 plenary demonstrates the system is functioning normally, with the Philippines removed and both Laos and Nepal added, indicating active progression of countries through their action plans. With 25 jurisdictions currently on the list, the statistical likelihood of at least one completing requirements or new additions is high. The FATF process requires countries to complete action plans and undergo successful on-site verification for removal, and ongoing mutual evaluations continuously identify potential additions. I'm not forecasting higher (closer to the 94% historical rate) because: (1) some inherent uncertainty always exists in institutional processes, (2) the specific readiness of countries depends on factors we cannot fully observe, and (3) prudent forecasting suggests modest discounting from pure base rates. I'm not forecasting lower because: (1) the historical pattern is extremely strong with only one exception under extraordinary circumstances, (2) recent evidence shows normal operations, (3) no information suggests procedural delays or extraordinary circumstances for June 2025, and (4) the large number of monitored jurisdictions increases the probability of at least one change. My forecast would increase with news of specific countries having completed action plans pending final approval, or announcements of new evaluations. It would decrease with announcements of procedural delays, extraordinary meeting circumstances, or explicit focus on policy work only.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring\" list, which at the time of this question consists of Algeria, Angola, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Mali, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Yemen. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical data on FATF plenaries shows consistent changes to the grey list.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
