    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling points I hadn't fully weighted. Most significantly, Forecaster 3's claim that the site has been offline since January 21, 2025 (nearly 4 months) is crucial - if accurate, this indicates sustained policy commitment rather than a brief political action. This is much longer than I initially assumed. Forecaster 3's historical precedent from the 2017-2021 Trump administration is valuable: websites taken offline during that period often remained down for years. Both forecasters correctly emphasize the compressed 42-day timeframe and slow government bureaucracy. The mention of potential June congressional hearings is noted, but both correctly assess that hearings rarely produce immediate policy reversals. The clustering of forecasts at 8-10% versus my 13% suggests I may have been too optimistic about the possibility of restoration.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating downward. The key factors driving this revision are: (1) The 4-month offline period indicates this is sustained, deliberate policy rather than temporary action - much stronger evidence than I initially weighted. (2) Historical precedent from 2017-2021 Trump administration suggests these removals tend to be persistent. (3) With only 42 days remaining, the timeframe for bureaucratic action is extremely compressed, especially given the administration's demonstrated commitment to climate initiative removal. (4) While potential June hearings exist, they rarely produce immediate policy changes. I'm settling at 10% rather than 8% because: meaningful visibility gaps remain about internal processes, the site's media prominence could theoretically create unique pressure, and 42 days allows for some possibility of unexpected legal or political developments. However, the evidence strongly favors continued offline status through July 1st.",
