    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The outcome would be 'Yes', as the USDA's 'What Can SNAP Buy?' page currently lists 'snack foods' as an eligible item.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Under direction from new political leadership at the USDA, the agency makes a quick, symbolic change to its public-facing guidance by removing the specific phrase 'snack foods' from the list. This is done as an immediate signal of a policy shift toward promoting healthier food choices, even before a formal, lengthy rulemaking process to change eligibility could be completed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite public statements from new leadership about restricting certain food purchases, the force of bureaucratic inertia prevails. The process of changing official government guidance, even on a webpage, is slow. Higher-priority issues for the new administration and the lack of an immediate regulatory change mean that the existing text on the webpage remains untouched by the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily favors the status quo due to the extremely short timeline. The resolution date is just over a month away. While the provided background indicates a potential policy shift under a new administration to restrict 'bad food' purchases, implementing such a change through formal regulation is a lengthy process governed by the Administrative Procedure Act, which takes many months, if not years. Therefore, a 'No' outcome would require a non-regulatory change, specifically an administrative directive to alter the text on the USDA website. While this is possible as a quick, symbolic action, such changes in large government agencies are often slow. Bureaucratic inertia and the need for internal review, even for minor website text edits, makes it probable that the page will not be updated within this short timeframe. The research assistant's report provided no new information to suggest this specific, low-level change is being prioritized. My forecast is not higher than 85% because a direct order from a new, motivated political appointee could expedite such a simple website change as a way to signal a new policy direction quickly. It is not lower because the default for government processes is inaction and maintaining the status quo, and the barriers to even simple changes are often underestimated. I would lower my probability if there were public statements or leaked memos from USDA leadership specifically targeting changes to public-facing guidance on SNAP eligibility. I would raise it if the USDA made statements reinforcing current guidelines without mentioning any pending review.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
