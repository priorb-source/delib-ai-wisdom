    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most significant new evidence: Vietnamese troops completed K9 howitzer training in November 2024. This is a crucial detail I hadn't considered. Military training on specific equipment is a strong indicator of imminent procurement - countries don't invest in training personnel on systems they don't intend to acquire. This substantially increases the likelihood the deal is real and advanced. Forecaster 2 correctly identifies that the deal missed its Q1 2025 expected timeline, which is a negative signal suggesting complications or delays. However, both forecasters agree that 2 months remains a reasonable timeframe for announcement. The combination of recent concrete actions (training) with missed timelines creates tension in the forecast. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the November 2024 training as a 'very recent and concrete indicator' is compelling - only 6 months ago, and such training requires months of planning beforehand. This suggests the deal was substantially advanced as of late 2024.",
    "rationale": "Upon reviewing the other analyses, the November 2024 training is a game-changing piece of evidence I underweighted. Training military personnel on specific weapons systems is not speculative - it requires concrete plans, logistics, and confidence in procurement. This happened just 6 months ago, suggesting negotiations were genuinely advanced. However, the fact that 6 months have passed since that training without an announcement is concerning and aligns with Forecaster 2's observation about missing the Q1 timeline. This creates competing signals: strong recent preparation (training) versus extended silence (no announcement despite 'final stages' reporting). I maintain concerns about the tight 2-month timeline and China sensitivities, but the training signal suggests higher probability than my initial 40%. The deal appears real and advanced, but faces delays. With 2 months remaining and evidence of substantial groundwork, I'm updating upward but remaining cautious given the missed Q1 target and 6-month silence. The status quo bias is somewhat countered by the concrete preparation activities, but not eliminated.",
