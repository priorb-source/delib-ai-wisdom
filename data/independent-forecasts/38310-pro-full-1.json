  "information": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney formally invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the G7 summit scheduled for June 15-17, 2025, in Kananaskis, Alberta. The invitation was extended in March 2025. On May 27, 2025, Zelenskyy confirmed his intention to go, stating to Ukrainian journalists, \"G7: I was invited by the Canadian Prime Minister Carney. And I will be.\" Canadian security planning documents list Zelenskyy among the expected attendees, prompting preparations including a no-fly-zone over the area.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2024, Volodymyr Zelenskyy participated in three G7 summits: he attended the 2023 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, in person, and attended the 2022 summit in Elmau, Germany, and the 2024 summit in Apulia, Italy, virtually. Throughout the war, he has made numerous international trips, including visits to Washington, Paris, and Davos. On June 2, 2025, he arrived in Vilnius, Lithuania, to attend the Bucharest Nine summit ahead of the NATO summit scheduled for June 24-25 in The Hague.\n\nA key topic of discussion related to the G7 summit is the potential for new sanctions against Russia. US Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal have advocated for a new package of sanctions to be coordinated with European allies before the summit. However, according to news reports citing EU diplomats, it is unlikely that the European Union will have a new sanctions package ready by mid-June. President Zelenskyy has publicly called for increased pressure on Russia and for joint sanctions to be agreed upon at the G7 level.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12 days, as the summit runs from June 15-17, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. President Zelenskyy has publicly accepted the invitation and Canadian authorities are actively preparing for his in-person attendance.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A major, unforeseen event, such as a severe military escalation in Ukraine requiring his presence or a specific, high-level security threat against his travel, forces President Zelenskyy to cancel his trip at the last minute.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Events proceed as planned. President Zelenskyy follows through on his public commitment, travels to Kananaskis, Alberta, and physically attends the G7 summit to advocate for Ukraine's interests.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong convergence of multiple high-confidence indicators. The status quo is that he will attend. First, President Zelenskyy has made an unambiguous public commitment on May 27, 2025, stating, 'I will be.' For a head of state, such a clear statement is a very strong signal of intent. Second, the host nation, Canada, is proceeding with concrete and costly security preparations, including a no-fly-zone, based on the expectation of his arrival. Third, Zelenskyy has a powerful motivation to attend in person to lobby G7 leaders for continued support and new sanctions against Russia, an activity where personal diplomacy is significantly more effective than virtual participation. His recent and ongoing international travel, such as his visit to Lithuania on June 2, demonstrates his capability and willingness to travel abroad for key diplomatic events despite the ongoing war.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 95% because of the inherent volatility of a wartime situation. A sudden, major military crisis in Ukraine could compel him to remain in the country. Additionally, there is a persistent, non-zero risk of a specific security threat that could emerge and make the trip unacceptably dangerous. These low-probability, high-impact events are the primary reasons for not forecasting with near-certainty.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 95% because all current indicators point strongly towards his attendance. Barring one of the aforementioned crises, his presence is expected by all parties involved. The war has been ongoing for years, and he has established a pattern of traveling for high-stakes diplomatic engagements, such as his prior in-person attendance at the 2023 G7 summit. There is no current information suggesting such a crisis is imminent.\n\nI would decrease my forecast upon receiving credible reports of a major Russian offensive or a significant Ukrainian military setback, or specific intelligence regarding a threat to his travel. I would increase it to near 100% once there is confirmation that he has departed for Canada.",
