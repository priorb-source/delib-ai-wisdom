    "review": "The convergence at 93% across all three forecasters is notable and suggests we've identified the key factors correctly. Both forecasters emphasized points I considered but perhaps didn't weight heavily enough: (1) the 'ALL seven' requirement creates cumulative risk - even one removal triggers NO, and (2) recent blocking activity elsewhere (Tanzania, India) reinforces that global trends aren't toward liberalization. Forecaster 2 made an excellent point about policy changes being 'telegraphed in advance' - there's no indication of such signals for any of these countries. However, I notice none of us have verified the current Wikipedia page status, which introduces uncertainty. We're all assuming these seven are currently listed, but if one isn't already there, the resolution would be NO regardless of policy changes.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I remain confident in the 93% forecast. The key insight is treating this as seven quasi-independent events that all need to occur (each country remaining blocked AND listed on Wikipedia). If we estimate each country has ~99% probability of remaining blocked and listed over 26 days, then P(all seven) = 0.99^7 ≈ 93%, which aligns perfectly with our convergent forecast. The main risks are: (1) Wikipedia article restructuring or consensus issues (~3% risk), (2) unexpected policy reversal by one country, most likely Venezuela or Myanmar given their relative instability (~4-5% cumulative across all seven), and (3) one country already unblocked but Wikipedia not yet updated (~1% risk). These are authoritarian regimes with entrenched censorship - China since 2009, Russia since 2022, etc. The 26-day window is simply too short for meaningful policy shifts without prior signals, which we see no evidence of. The convergence across forecasters validates this reasoning rather than suggesting groupthink, as we independently identified the same critical factors.",
