  "information": "The US government documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024. A notable concentration of these incidents occurred in Arizona, which has become a hotspot for sightings, particularly involving military aircraft. On January 19, 2023, a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet was hit by an object described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system' over Arizona, damaging the plane's canopy. This was one of 22 UFO sightings reported by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. Some US officials have suggested that the mysterious objects could be advanced drones used by foreign drug cartels for surveillance and smuggling operations.\n\nAccording to news reports, Florida ranks among the top three US states for total UFO sightings, with 8,623 reported cases documented by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). On March 28, 2025, a US military aircraft encountered a large group of unidentified objects described as glowing spheres in the sky over Florida. A leaked audio recording of the pilot's radio conversation with an air traffic controller indicated the pilot saw several high-speed objects, experienced communication disruptions, and observed an unusual glow around the plane. A Lockheed AC-130 Spectre gunship was reportedly dispatched to the area in response to the incident.\n\nData from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) indicates that California has the most reported UFO sightings in the US, with 36,286 sightings since 1974. Following California in total sightings are Washington, Florida, Oregon, and New York. NUFORC's public archive shows approximately 100-150 pilot-flagged reports are logged nationwide in a typical year, which averages 8-12 per month. The distribution of these pilot reports is skewed, with California and Florida being the two most common states for such reports, followed by a tier including Arizona, Texas, and Washington. In March 2025, a US Air Force pilot in California reported seeing 'three orange-like lights' hovering above Los Angeles.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days until June 2025 ends, with the outcome determinable by early July 2025 when NUFORC data becomes accessible",
    "status_quo_outcome": "California has the most pilot UFO sightings in June 2025, as it has historically been either the top or tied with Florida for pilot-specific reports while maintaining the highest overall UFO reporting volume",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "California continues its historical pattern and receives 3-4 pilot reports in June 2025 while Florida receives 2-3, or Arizona/Texas have an unusual spike in pilot activity due to increased military operations near their bases, surpassing both California and Florida",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The March 28, 2025 incident in Florida generates continued heightened awareness and reporting among pilots flying through Florida airspace, resulting in 4-5 pilot reports in June while California only receives 2-3, or military activity near Florida bases remains elevated leading to more pilot encounters",
    "rationale": "This forecast centers on the competition between California and Florida for pilot-specific UFO reports. Key factors: (1) Small sample size - with only 8-12 pilot reports nationwide per month, random variation plays a large role and any state's count could range from 0-5 in a given month. (2) Historical baseline shows California and Florida as co-leaders for pilot reports, though California has higher overall UFO reporting volume (36,286 vs 8,623 total). (3) Recent context includes the March 28, 2025 Florida incident involving a military aircraft, which could indicate continued heightened activity or awareness in June. However, California also had pilot activity in March 2025. (4) The resolution requires Florida to have MORE than any other state - ties count as No, which increases the difficulty. The status quo slightly favors California given its historical edge in total reporting volume and robust aviation activity, but Florida remains highly competitive for pilot-specific reports. The March incident provides modest upward pressure on Florida's probability, but not enough to overcome California's baseline advantage. I'm not higher because California maintains structural advantages (more total aviation activity, historical reporting leadership). I'm not lower because Florida is genuinely competitive for pilot reports specifically and has recent incident momentum. I would update higher if data showed June having unusual military activity concentrated in Florida, or if pilot reporting patterns in April-May 2025 showed Florida trending ahead. I would update lower if California showed a surge in pilot reports in the spring months.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe US government documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
