    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides crucial historical data I didn't have: March inflation was already 14.6%, only 0.4 percentage points below the 15% threshold. This dramatically changes the analysis. The documented trend (12.9% → 13.4% → 14.6%) shows clear acceleration, with increases of 0.5pp and then 1.2pp. Monthly inflation jumped from 0.8% in February to 1.5% in March, confirming intensifying price pressures. The specific sectoral data (food 17.4%, housing/utilities 20.2%) aligns with my assistant's Easter basket findings and reinforces the upward momentum.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis relies heavily on NBU year-end forecasts, but this reasoning has flaws. An April peak at 15% followed by moderation through the rest of 2025 could easily produce an 8.7% year-end average. More importantly, Forecaster 3 appears unaware that March already reached 14.6%, making their suggestion of 'high single digits to low teens' inconsistent with realized data. Central bank forecasts can lag real-time developments, especially in wartime economies with rapidly evolving conditions.\n\nThe key question becomes: given March at 14.6% with accelerating momentum, what's the probability April stays below 15%? This would require essentially flat inflation despite ongoing war pressures, energy attacks, and high food price inflation. While month-to-month volatility exists and seasonal factors could provide some relief, the proximity to the threshold combined with recent acceleration makes crossing 15% quite likely.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating significantly upward based on Forecaster 2's hard data showing March inflation at 14.6%. This single piece of information is the most critical factor - we're only 0.4 percentage points from the threshold with demonstrated acceleration. The pattern of increasing increments (0.5pp, then 1.2pp) suggests momentum rather than stabilization. All the structural factors I originally identified (war disruptions, energy infrastructure attacks, high food inflation) remain in place to push April higher.\n\nHowever, I'm not going as high as Forecaster 2's 78% because: (1) month-to-month inflation can be volatile and doesn't always follow linear trends; (2) base effects could moderate the annual rate; (3) seasonal vegetable production increases mentioned by my assistant could provide some offsetting deflation; (4) the NBU's restrictive policy may have lagged effects that show up in April.\n\nAgainst Forecaster 3's lower estimate, the March 14.6% reading is dispositive evidence that inflation is already in the high teens, not 'high single digits to low teens.' The burden of proof has shifted - we need reasons why April would decline or stay flat from 14.6%, not reasons why it would reach 15% from a lower base.",
