  "information": "On May 11, 2025, a federal judge in New Jersey extended a temporary restraining order (TRO) that bars ICE from deporting Mahmoud Khalil. The extension was granted because the court found Khalil’s First-Amendment and Administrative Procedure Act claims to be “plausible.” Further legal briefings have been scheduled, and TROs that are extended typically remain in effect until a court rules on a motion for a preliminary injunction.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. A federal court's temporary restraining order (TRO) is currently in effect, legally preventing the deportation of Mahmoud Khalil.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The federal court's temporary restraining order remains in place, or is converted into a preliminary injunction, extending past the July 1, 2025 deadline. The legal proceedings regarding his case continue, preventing ICE from executing a deportation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The federal judge presiding over the case rules swiftly against Mahmoud Khalil, dissolving the TRO and denying a preliminary injunction. ICE then acts with unusual speed to arrange and carry out the deportation before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The core of this forecast is the active judicial barrier to deportation. A federal judge extended a temporary restraining order on May 11, 2025, finding Khalil's First-Amendment and APA claims 'plausible.' This is a strong indicator that the court believes the case has merit and requires careful consideration, a process that is very unlikely to conclude in the government's favor within the short, six-and-a-half-week timeframe before July 1. The status quo is non-deportation by court order, a significant hurdle to overcome. For a 'Yes' outcome, the legal process would need to accelerate dramatically, result in a decisive ruling against Khalil, and be followed by immediate administrative action from ICE. The typical pace of such federal legal proceedings makes this sequence of events highly improbable. My forecast is not lower (i.e., closer to 0%) because there is always a small possibility of an unexpectedly rapid judicial decision against Khalil that clears the way for deportation. It is not higher because the court's explicit finding of 'plausible' claims and the scheduling of further briefings represent a formidable legal obstacle that is very likely to extend beyond the resolution date. My forecast would move toward 0 if a preliminary injunction is granted, and it would increase significantly if the court were to dissolve the TRO in the next few weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mahmoud Khalil be deported before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mahmoud Khalil's challenge to his detention moves forward]()\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the United States deports Mahmoud Khalil before July 1, 2025. For purposes of this question, \"deported\" means Khalil being transported out of the territory of the United States against his will.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 11, 2025, a federal judge in New Jersey extended a temporary restraining order (TRO) that bars ICE from deporting Mahmoud Khalil.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
