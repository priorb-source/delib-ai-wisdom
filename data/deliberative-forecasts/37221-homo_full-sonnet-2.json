    "review": "The convergence of forecasts at 23-25% is striking and reassuring. All three analyses identified the same key evidence: March inflation at exactly 2.2%, the downward trend from 2.3% in February, the consensus forecast of 2.1%, and multiple disinflationary factors (ECB rate cuts, weak PMI, decelerating wages, negative energy contribution). Forecaster 3 made an excellent point about professional forecasters rarely missing by more than 0.1-0.2pp at short horizons, which provides a statistical basis for our probability range. Forecaster 2 appropriately highlighted month-to-month volatility. No new factual information was introduced that I hadn't already considered. The convergence suggests we're all properly weighing the evidence: the consensus of 2.1% is 0.1pp below the 2.2% threshold, and with typical forecast errors of 0.15pp, a ~23-25% probability of exceeding 2.2% is statistically well-calibrated. The analyses are consistent, thorough, and arrive at similar conclusions through sound reasoning.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find no compelling reason to update my forecast. We all independently identified the same evidence and arrived at nearly identical probabilities (23-25%). The convergence actually increases my confidence in this range. The key factors remain: (1) consensus forecast of 2.1% is below the 2.2% threshold by 0.1pp, (2) clear disinflationary trend from 2.3% to 2.2%, (3) multiple structural disinflationary forces in play, (4) typical consensus forecast errors of 0.1-0.2pp at short horizons justify a ~25% probability of missing upward by more than 0.1pp. My 23% forecast properly accounts for forecast uncertainty - we're close to the threshold, services inflation remains elevated, and surprises can occur - while still reflecting that the weight of evidence points toward a reading at or below 2.2%. The statistical basis for this probability is sound: if consensus is 2.1% with a standard error of ~0.15pp, P(actual > 2.2%) ≈ 25%. I'm maintaining my forecast at 23%.",
