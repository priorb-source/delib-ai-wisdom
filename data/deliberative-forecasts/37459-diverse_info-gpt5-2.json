    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the low base rate with concrete points I hadn’t explicitly quantified: roughly 10 consecutive quarters of net selling and an extremely low portfolio turnover (~1%). Forecaster 2’s note that Buffett has criticized the Mag 7’s rising capital intensity is a salient, forward-looking deterrent. I find this persuasive and additive. Forecaster 3’s tariff-timing argument is less convincing (and somewhat internally inconsistent about early-2025 declines), but the core thrust—no clear Q1 catalyst at attractive prices—still supports a low probability. Neither addresses the key wrinkle that Berkshire frequently seeks SEC confidential treatment when accumulating, which would make a Yes less likely even if buying began.",
    "rationale": "The dominant signals remain: Berkshire’s multi-quarter net-selling stance, comfort with rising cash, Buffett’s skepticism of capital-intensive AI buildouts, and specific frictions (MSFT optics historically, Tesla/auto skepticism, Nvidia/semis risk). Alphabet or Meta are the only plausible candidates and would most likely be initiated by Todd/Ted as modest positions. However, if Berkshire were building a sizable stake, they’d likely request confidential treatment, meaning the Q1 13F wouldn’t show it—pushing the odds of a Yes down further for this specific filing. The added evidence (10 straight selling quarters and the turnover statistic) tilts me modestly lower. I still reserve a small chance for a disclosed, smaller Todd/Ted initiation in Alphabet or Meta without confidentiality, but consider Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla very unlikely. I’m reducing my forecast from 12% to 7%.",
