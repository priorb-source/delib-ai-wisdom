    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the key points I relied on: the 2027 PLA readiness anchor, the absence of large-scale amphibious/logistics indicators, and the distinction between elevated “crisis” risk and the much rarer threshold of a ground-force invasion. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on base rates/status quo bias and the CFR “crisis ≠ invasion” clarification are useful. Forecaster 2’s stress on the catastrophic risk for Beijing of a premature landing and the deterrent effect of U.S./Japan posture are also persuasive. Neither added specific new evidence of imminent preparations, and neither addressed in depth the wording nuance required by the resolution (U.S. must publicly label it an invasion involving ground forces). That nuance actually trims the already small tail risk from a limited offshore-island incident, since Washington could choose terms like “seizure” or “use of force” rather than “invasion,” and Beijing might employ coast guard/armed police rather than PLA ground troops. Overall, their arguments modestly strengthen the case for a slightly lower probability than my prior 3%.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining (~8 weeks) and the requirement that the U.S. publicly accuse China of sending ground military forces into Taiwan make this a very high bar. Intelligence and military signaling continue to point to 2027 as the key PLA readiness window, and there are no public signs of the massed amphibious/logistics posture that would precede a landing. Seasonal/weather factors (approaching typhoon season) further complicate a near-term amphibious operation. The most plausible tail event—PRC action against an outlying Taiwan-held island—still faces two hurdles for resolution: Beijing might rely on coast guard/paramilitary rather than PLA ground forces, and the U.S. could avoid the specific “invasion” framing. Given the concurrence from the other forecasters and the lack of new indicators, I’m nudging down slightly to reflect these wording and force-composition nuances while retaining a small tail for miscalculation or a limited fait accompli that Washington explicitly labels an invasion.",
