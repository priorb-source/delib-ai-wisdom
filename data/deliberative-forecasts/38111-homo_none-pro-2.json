    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identify the late-May France-UK initiative as the key driver for this question. My reasoning and Forecaster 2's were highly aligned, both seeing this as a strong signal that creates significant momentum, making a June recognition likely. Forecaster 3 introduced a crucial and compelling counterargument that I had previously underweight: the inherent inertia and slow pace of diplomacy. Their point that a major announcement does not always translate into immediate action within a 30-day window, and that the diplomatic status quo has significant baked-in resistance to change, is a strong check on excessive optimism. Forecaster 3's emphasis on distinguishing an 'initiative' (the start of a process) from an immediate outcome was particularly insightful and convinced me that my initial forecast was too high.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 70% to 60%. My initial analysis was heavily weighted towards the powerful diplomatic momentum created by the France-UK announcement. I believed this would be sufficient to push at least one predisposed country to act immediately in June to capitalize on the moment. However, Forecaster 3's argument about the slow pace of diplomatic action is a valid and significant consideration. An 'initiative' announced in late May is realistically the starting gun for the final internal processes of other nations, which can easily take more than four weeks to navigate, especially given likely diplomatic pushback from the US or Israel. My initial forecast did not adequately account for this bureaucratic and diplomatic friction. I am not lowering my probability as far as Forecaster 3's 45% because I still believe the political cover provided by two P5 members is a uniquely powerful accelerant that makes a short-term recognition more likely than not. My updated forecast of 60% better balances the strong, new momentum against the persistent, underlying inertia of international relations.",
