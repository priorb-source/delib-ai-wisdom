    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two and a half weeks, as the announcement is expected around June 21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "A slight month-over-month contraction (a 'No' outcome). Monthly industrial production data is highly volatile, and a significant surge like the one in March is often followed by a 'payback' period or reversion to the mean as production schedules normalize.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Industrial production falls in April compared to March. This outcome would likely be driven by a combination of factors: a statistical 'payback' after an exceptionally strong March, and the end-of-fiscal-year effect, where companies front-loaded production into March to meet annual targets, leading to a natural slowdown in April.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Industrial production in Tohoku posts a second consecutive month of growth. This would indicate that the 7.6% surge in March was not an anomaly but the start of a robust recovery, potentially fueled by a weak yen boosting export demand for the region's products or the ramp-up of new manufacturing projects.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is centered on the common patterns observed in volatile, high-frequency economic data like the Industrial Production Index. The key piece of information is the powerful 7.6% month-over-month increase in March 2025. While this is a strong positive signal, it must be contextualized. First, it came after two consecutive months of decline, indicating underlying volatility rather than a smooth trend. Second, and more importantly, March marks the end of the fiscal year for most Japanese companies. It is a very common pattern to see a surge in production and shipments in March as companies rush to meet annual targets, which is then followed by a lull in April as activity normalizes. This 'payback' effect makes a second consecutive month of growth challenging, as the baseline from March is now very high. While the March data could signal a genuine recovery, the statistical and seasonal headwinds pointing to a slight contraction in April are significant. Given that my research assistant provided no additional information, I am relying on this typical seasonal pattern as the primary driver of my forecast.\n\nMy probability is not lower (e.g., 30%) because the 7.6% increase is a strong signal of positive momentum that cannot be entirely dismissed as a seasonal quirk. A genuine recovery in key sectors like automotive or electronics could be underway, strong enough to overpower the payback effect. \n\nMy probability is not higher (e.g., 60%) because the historical precedent for a slowdown after a fiscal year-end surge is very strong. Betting on two consecutive, strong months of growth in such a volatile index requires more evidence of a structural shift, which is currently lacking.\n\nI would become more positive on a 'Yes' outcome if leading indicators for April, such as regional manufacturing PMIs or national export data, showed continued strength. Conversely, I would lower my probability if reports emerged of production cuts in key Tohoku industries or if early national-level data for April was particularly weak.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Northeast Japan region (Tohoku) show a month-over-month increase in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tohoku's March industrial production index rises 7.6% from the previous month, the first increase in three months](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCC214DI0R20C25A5000000/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [industrial production announcement](https://www.tohoku.meti.go.jp/cyosa/tokei/iip.html) for April 2025 (expected approximately June 21, 2025) reports a monthly change in production (\"生産\") of greater than 0.0%.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
