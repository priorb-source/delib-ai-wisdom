    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides crucial historical context I underweighted: the Liberal Democrats have NEVER been the largest party on Cornwall Council since 2009, and the starting deficit is 31 seats (Conservatives 44, Lib Dems 13). Their emphasis on Independents fragmenting the anti-Conservative vote is well-taken - even if Conservatives collapse, those seats may not flow to Lib Dems. However, their 15% may be too anchored to historical patterns given the unprecedented national Conservative collapse.\n\nForecaster 3 identifies new tactical information: £100,000 Lib Dem fundraising, near-full candidate slate, and Conservative council leader retirement. The MRP poll reference is intriguing but lacks detail. Their 60% seems optimistic given the historical precedent and Independent factor, potentially overweighting national trends in a local context.\n\nBoth forecasters agree on the enormous starting deficit (31 seats), which I hadn't fully appreciated. The historical precedent against Lib Dems ever being largest party is powerful evidence I underweighted. However, Forecaster 2 may underestimate unprecedented national conditions, while Forecaster 3 may underestimate how Independents complicate the arithmetic.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm revising down from 40% to 32%. The key factors driving this adjustment:\n\n**Why DOWN:**\n1. The historical precedent is stark - Lib Dems have never been largest party on Cornwall Council in its 16-year history. This is a significant pattern.\n2. The starting deficit is larger than I initially weighted: 44 vs 13 seats is a 31-seat gap requiring extraordinary swings.\n3. The Independent factor is more significant than I initially assessed. Even with Conservative collapse, many seats will likely go to Independents rather than consolidating behind Lib Dems.\n4. Seat arithmetic: Lib Dems need ~25-30 seats to be largest (doubling their total), while preventing Conservatives from holding ~25+ AND preventing Independents from exceeding that threshold.\n\n**Why not LOWER (to Forecaster 2's 15%):**\n1. The national Conservative collapse is genuinely unprecedented - 22% approval is catastrophic.\n2. Specific campaign indicators (£100,000 fundraising, near-full slate, Conservative leader retirement) suggest serious Lib Dem organization.\n3. 2024 general election victories in North Cornwall and St Ives demonstrate real Cornwall-specific momentum.\n4. The Conservative-Reform split (22% vs 25%) structurally benefits Lib Dems.\n5. MRP poll reference, while vague, suggests sophisticated modeling may support Lib Dem chances.\n\n**Why not HIGHER (to Forecaster 3's 60%):**\nThe combination of never having achieved this before, the 31-seat starting deficit, and the Independent fragmentation makes 60% overconfident.",
