  "information": "Historical results show the Liberal Party won 160 seats in the 2021 federal election and 157 seats in the 2019 federal election. The last time the Liberal Party won a majority government was in the 2015 election, when they secured 184 seats.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 months (election expected on or before Oct 20, 2025; outcome known on election night)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — current polling and seat projections have the Liberals far below 172 seats, with Conservatives well ahead nationally.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Polling remains similar through the campaign: Conservatives win a comfortable plurality or majority; Liberals finish well under majority levels, concentrated in urban cores and parts of Atlantic Canada and Ontario, with limited gains in Quebec and BC.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A late and broad Liberal surge driven by a leadership change or major narrative shift (e.g., economic improvement plus a Conservative scandal). Liberals re-establish a clear lead in Ontario, gain significantly in Quebec at the Bloc’s expense, sweep most of Atlantic Canada, and improve in BC while limiting losses elsewhere—consolidating centre-left vote via strategic voting and NDP weakness, yielding 172+ seats.",
    "rationale": "Baseline conditions are strongly unfavorable to a Liberal majority. For months, national polling averages have shown the Conservatives with a sizable lead and the Liberals in the low-to-mid 20s nationally, implying seat projections far short of 172 on models like 338Canada. Under FPTP, a party typically needs roughly high-30s national vote share with advantageous regional distribution to cross ~170 seats; the Liberals would need a very large swing from current levels across multiple regions (especially Ontario and Quebec) to reach 172. The status quo therefore points clearly to No, and good forecasting practice places extra weight on the status quo because large, coordinated, multi-region opinion shifts within six months are uncommon. Historical context from the research assistant: the Liberals last exceeded this mark in 2015 with 184 seats during a wave election; their 2019 (157) and 2021 (160) outcomes were well below 172, and today’s polling climate is materially worse for them than in those cycles. Why not higher: Closing what appears to be a double-digit national gap, overcoming government fatigue, and outcompeting both the Bloc in Quebec and the NDP in urban centers within six months is a very tall order; probability mass for 172+ sits deep in the Liberal right tail across simulations. Why not lower: Tail risks exist. Potential catalysts include a leadership change that produces a large bounce, a major Conservative misstep or scandal, significant economic improvement, and strong strategic voting that collapses NDP/Bloc support late. Canada’s FPTP can amplify swings if they concentrate in seat‑rich Ontario and parts of Quebec. What would move me upward: sustained polls narrowing to a near tie nationally (or Liberals leading), 338Canada simulations assigning meaningful (>5%) probability to 170+ Liberal seats, clear Liberal leads in Ontario, tangible gains in Quebec at Bloc’s expense, and/or a leadership change accompanied by durable polling improvement. What would move me downward: continued or widening Conservative lead into the campaign, stagnant or declining Liberal support in Ontario and Quebec, and projection models showing vanishingly small upper tails for Liberal seat counts.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Liberal Party win 172 or more seats in the 2025 Canadian federal election?\n\nQuestion background:\n[338Canada Federal Projection](https://338canada.com/federal.htm): \"The 338Canada project is a statistical model of electoral projections based on opinion polls, electoral history, and demographic data. This web site is a creation of Philippe J. Fournier, physics and astrophysics professor at Cégep de Saint-Laurent in Montreal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Liberal Party of Canada wins greater than or equal to 172 seats in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical results show the Liberal Party won 160 seats in the 2021 federal election and 157 seats in the 2019 federal election. The last time the Liberal Party won a majority government was in the 2015 election, when they secured 184 seats.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
