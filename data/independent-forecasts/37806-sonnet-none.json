    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Trump has not issued a presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa in his first ~4 months in office",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues focusing on other immigration priorities like border security and asylum policy. He may address visa programs through other means or statements that don't constitute formal presidential actions, or simply not prioritize the Diversity Visa program specifically before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump issues an executive order or presidential proclamation addressing immigration policy that specifically mentions the 'Diversity Visa' program by name, possibly seeking to suspend, restrict, or eliminate it as part of his broader immigration agenda. This could be triggered by current events, political momentum, or the recent release of DV-2026 lottery results.",
    "rationale": "Several factors inform this forecast. Trump has historically opposed the Diversity Visa program and advocated for its cancellation, as evidenced by the American Conservative article. He frequently uses presidential actions for immigration policy implementation. However, key countervailing factors exist: (1) Status quo bias - Trump has been in office for approximately 4 months without issuing such an action, suggesting it may not be a top priority; (2) The requirement is highly specific, demanding the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' appear in a formal presidential action on the White House website; (3) Trump may address immigration through broader orders that don't use this specific terminology; (4) With only 6 weeks remaining, there are limited opportunities for this to occur. The recent release of DV-2026 lottery results could serve as a trigger, but hasn't yet. My forecast is not higher because the status quo of inaction for 4 months is strong evidence, and presidential actions on this specific program may not be prioritized over border security and asylum issues. My forecast is not lower because Trump's known opposition and his propensity for executive actions on immigration create meaningful probability of action. I would update higher if reports emerged of draft executive orders on visa programs, or if Trump made recent public statements specifically about the Diversity Visa. I would update lower as we approach July 1st without any signals of pending action.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
