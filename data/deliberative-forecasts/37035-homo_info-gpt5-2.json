    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the key precedent: CDC almost never issues Level 3 for yellow fever, even during sizable outbreaks (Brazil 2016–18; Angola 2016). They add useful specifics I hadn’t cited: current Colombian cases/deaths are modest in absolute terms; transmission appears concentrated in rural departments (no verified urban spread in major cities); Colombia has broad risk mapping and active vaccination campaigns; and regional totals don’t suggest explosive growth. They also underline that any escalation would need to be visible and sustained into early June. The only incremental push upward is their emphasis on tail risks (seasonal vector dynamics, vaccine access issues, potential urban spillover). Overall, their analyses largely support my initial low probability, with a small nod to non-zero tails.",
    "rationale": "The short time window (~5–6 weeks), strong CDC precedent of keeping yellow fever at Level 2 with vaccination guidance, and the current epidemiology (rural/sylvatic pattern, no confirmed urban transmission) make a Level 3+ upgrade by the June 1 check unlikely. A Level 3 would require a qualitatively different risk profile for travelers—e.g., sustained urban transmission in major hubs, material vaccine inaccessibility for travelers, or clear healthcare strain—none of which is currently evident. That said, acknowledging potential late-breaking risks (rainy-season vector surge, sudden urban clusters, vaccine supply constraints) and the breadth of high/very high risk municipalities, I make a slight upward adjustment to reflect tail uncertainty. Still, base rates and CDC practice dominate.",
