  "information": "In April 2025, several protests occurred in India related to land and religious laws. On April 14, protests against a Muslim land law in eastern India turned violent, resulting in three reported deaths. Separately, from April 8-12, violent protests against the Waqf Act took place in Murshidabad, West Bengal. Muslim communities also held symbolic \"Lights Off\" protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025. Ongoing communal tensions have been noted in West Bengal and Uttarakhand.\n\nReports from various news outlets indicate several planned or recent mobilizations. The Free Press Journal reported on a planned march involving 10,000 farmers. India Today has covered rallies organized by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) for teachers. Additionally, a global housing action day protest was scheduled for April 26, 2025, with events planned in multiple countries, including India.\n\nIndia has a history of large-scale demonstrations that have exceeded 10,000 participants, including the farmers' protests of 2020-2021 and the anti-CAA protests of 2019-2020. The Global Protest Tracker recorded 145 anti-government protests worldwide in the 12 months preceding May 2025. Reports also indicate that authorities in India have used technologies such as drones with facial recognition to identify participants in farmer protests and subsequently confiscate their passports.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Currently, no new protest has been reported by the Global Protest Tracker that meets the criteria.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Any protests that occur in India over the next two months fail to attract 10,000 participants. Alternatively, a protest of this size does occur but is not reported by the Global Protest Tracker before the July 1, 2025 deadline, perhaps due to a reporting lag.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Triggered by ongoing disputes over land laws, religious acts, or agricultural policies, a protest drawing over 10,000 people occurs. For example, the planned farmers' march goes ahead and achieves its target attendance. The event is picked up by news media and subsequently cataloged by the Global Protest Tracker before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "India has a high base rate of large-scale protests, and the current political climate is particularly tense with multiple active flashpoints, including conflicts over land and religious laws in West Bengal and Uttarakhand. My research notes a specific, planned march involving 10,000 farmers, which, if it proceeds and is reported, would single-handedly resolve this question as 'Yes'. The existence of multiple, independent potential triggers for mass mobilization in a two-month window strongly suggests a high likelihood of a qualifying event. The status quo is 'No', but the environment is volatile, not stable, reducing the weight I place on the status quo. My forecast is not higher primarily due to the short, two-month time frame and the specific reporting requirement; a protest could occur late in the period and not be logged by the Global Protest Tracker before the deadline. My forecast is not lower because the combination of historical precedent, multiple ongoing social conflicts, and specific intelligence about planned mobilizations makes the occurrence of a large protest more likely than not in the near term. I would increase my forecast upon seeing confirmed dates and widespread media coverage for the planned farmers' protest. I would decrease it if key protest movements were to de-escalate or reach agreements with authorities.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
