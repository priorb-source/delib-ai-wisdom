    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identify the central tension: the powerful status quo, defined by the UK Supreme Court's ruling and Westminster's opposition, versus the political pressure on the Scottish National Party (SNP) to act. My initial forecast of 5% was closely aligned with Forecaster 3, who also emphasized the very short timeframe and the high bar for a single poll to trigger a major strategic shift. I find this reasoning highly convincing as it anchors the forecast in the most durable structural factors. However, Forecaster 2 raises a crucial and persuasive point I had previously undervalued: the specific nature of the resolution criteria. Because the question resolves 'Yes' on a simple announcement from a Scottish authority, regardless of UK legality, the barrier to a 'Yes' is much lower than the barrier to an actual, legally-binding referendum. Forecaster 2 convincingly argues that a purely tactical or symbolic announcement could be a tempting move for the SNP to galvanize its base in response to a strong poll, even if they have no realistic expectation of holding the vote. This highlights a potential motivation for an announcement that is driven by political messaging rather than practical planning.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am increasing my forecast from 5% to 10%. My initial forecast was based heavily on the formidable legal and political barriers to holding a referendum, which Forecaster 3 also rightly emphasized. These barriers make the status quo ('No' outcome) extremely likely. However, Forecaster 2 made a compelling case for the tactical value of a purely symbolic announcement. Given the resolution criteria hinge only on an 'announcement' and not its legality, the SNP could declare a date to satisfy its base, energize the movement following a positive poll, and create a political challenge for the UK government, all without needing a viable path to actually holding the vote. I believe I initially understated the probability of such a politically-motivated gesture. The time frame is extremely short, and the risks of such a move backfiring are high, which is why I cannot agree with Forecaster 2's 20%. But the possibility of a tactical announcement as a piece of political theatre is plausible enough to warrant doubling my initial forecast. I am moving from a position where a 'Yes' would be a complete shock to one where it is a recognized, albeit unlikely, strategic gambit.",
