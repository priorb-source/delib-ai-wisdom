  "information": "Donald Trump has a history of attending high-profile sporting events. His recent UFC appearances include UFC 309 in November 2024 and UFC 314 on April 13, 2025. His attendance at UFC 314 was noted on his official public schedule. The time between UFC 314 in Miami and UFC 316 in Newark is less than two months. Some analyses of his past behavior suggest he rarely attends two UFC events in such close succession.\n\nUFC 316 is scheduled for June 7, 2025, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. The event's main fight is a bantamweight title rematch between Sean O'Malley and Merab Dvalishvili. Donald Trump and UFC President Dana White have a long-standing public friendship. In the past, Trump hosted early UFC events at his properties, including the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. White has publicly supported Trump, including an appearance at the 2024 National Republican Convention.\n\nAt UFC 314 in Miami on April 13, 2025, Donald Trump was seen with Dana White and Elon Musk. Reports also mentioned the presence of political figures such as Kash Patel, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Kristi Noem, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio. Trump was greeted by Shaquille O'Neal and Joe Rogan, and he entered the arena to the song 'American Bad Ass' by Kid Rock, receiving a positive reaction from the crowd.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "38 days - UFC 316 is scheduled for June 7, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Trump does not attend. The baseline for any given UFC event is non-attendance, as Trump does not attend most UFC events despite his friendship with Dana White.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump declines to attend due to the short interval since his last UFC appearance at UFC 314 (less than two months prior), or because presidential obligations, security concerns, or scheduling conflicts prevent him from attending an event in Newark.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump attends despite the short interval because of his close relationship with Dana White, the proximity of Newark to his New York properties, the high-profile nature of the bantamweight title rematch, and his apparent enjoyment of the positive reception he receives at UFC events.",
    "rationale": "The key tension in this forecast is between Trump's demonstrated interest in UFC events and the unusually short timeframe since his last attendance. Trump attended UFC 314 on April 13, 2025 - only 17 days ago from today's date. The research assistant explicitly notes that Trump 'rarely attends two UFC events in such close succession,' with his previous pattern showing roughly 5 months between UFC 309 (November 2024) and UFC 314 (April 2025). The interval between UFC 314 and UFC 316 is less than two months, which appears inconsistent with his historical pattern. Factors supporting attendance include Trump's strong friendship with Dana White, the Newark location's proximity to NYC, and Trump receiving positive receptions at these events. However, the status quo strongly suggests non-attendance. As President, Trump has numerous competing demands on his time, and the base rate of him attending any specific UFC event remains low even given his increased recent attendance. The short succession between events is the most significant factor weighing against attendance. For me to update higher, I would need evidence that Trump's schedule explicitly lists UFC 316, public statements indicating his intention to attend, or clear precedent for him attending UFC events this close together. For me to update lower, I would need information about conflicting presidential obligations or statements suggesting he won't attend.",
