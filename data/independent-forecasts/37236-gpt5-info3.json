  "information": "Total US exports for February 2025 were reported at $278.5 billion. Historical data shows that between 79% and 93% of Aprils have seen a year-over-year gain in exports. The Atlanta Federal Reserve estimated that trade subtracted 3 percentage points from GDP in the first quarter of 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5–6 weeks (the April 2025 International Trade in Goods and Services release is expected in early June 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — recent monthly exports (~$278.5B in Feb 2025) comfortably exceed the $262.6B threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sharp, near-term drop in exports (≥6% vs recent levels) driven by factors such as a stronger USD and weaker foreign demand, a temporary slump in aircraft deliveries, energy price declines cutting nominal petroleum exports, shipping disruptions, or rapid retaliation to new U.S. tariffs that curtails U.S. exports in April.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Exports continue near recent trends, with stable services exports (travel, business, IP), resilient goods exports, and no major April-specific shock—keeping the monthly total around $270–280B, above the $262.6B threshold.",
    "rationale": "Anchor: The status quo points to a Yes. The Census/BEA reported February 2025 exports at $278.5B, which is ~6% above the April 2024 threshold of $262.6B. Month-to-month volatility exists, but total exports typically do not swing enough to erase that gap absent a clear shock, especially with services exports providing stability. The research assistant notes most Aprils historically show year-over-year gains (79–93%), which supports a positive base rate. The Atlanta Fed’s Q1 estimate that trade subtracted from GDP speaks to net exports; it can reflect imports outpacing exports rather than an outright drop in exports, so it is not, by itself, a strong bearish signal for the April export level. Why not higher: Risks include potential retaliation to new U.S. tariffs, stronger USD weighing on foreign demand, Boeing delivery or aerospace export weakness, energy price softness reducing nominal export values, and logistics disruptions. Any of these could produce an unusually large April downtick. Why not lower: The threshold is modest relative to recent prints; services exports are relatively steady; absent a discrete shock, exports tend to drift rather than plunge. What would move me up: Advance April goods export data showing strength, stable-to-higher oil prices, solid global PMIs/new export orders, evidence of stable Boeing deliveries, and a benign USD. What would move me down: Signs of sharp April weakness in the advance goods report, notable aircraft delivery shortfalls, a stronger dollar spike, a drop in commodity prices, or clear foreign retaliation reducing U.S. export orders.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US exports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of exports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 262,578 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nTotal US exports for February 2025 were reported at $278.5 billion. Historical data shows that between 79% and 93% of Aprils have seen a year-over-year gain in exports. The Atlanta Federal Reserve estimated that trade subtracted 3 percentage points from GDP in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
