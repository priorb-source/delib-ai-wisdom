    "review": "The other forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus on the core arguments. We all agree that the recent March unemployment figure of 2.2% creates a powerful status quo that is difficult to overcome in a single month. The arguments regarding the typical lag time for tariff impacts on employment and the buffering effect of Mexico's large informal sector are compelling and shared among all of us. Forecaster 2's framing of the April data being 'already occurred' is a particularly effective way to emphasize this short-term inertia. However, Forecaster 3 introduced a critical and previously unconsidered point: the 'series/measurement risk.' This pertains to the specific data series, rounding conventions, and potential revisions used by Trading Economics, the arbiter of this question. This is a significant source of uncertainty that exists independently of the underlying economic reality.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 85%. My initial reasoning was heavily based on the large buffer provided by the 2.2% March unemployment rate and the unlikelihood of a rapid 0.8 percentage point jump in a single month due to new tariffs. The analyses from the other forecasters strongly reinforced my conviction in these core economic arguments, which on their own might have led me to increase my confidence slightly, perhaps to 87% in line with Forecaster 2. However, Forecaster 3's excellent point about the measurement risk associated with the resolution source, Trading Economics, introduces a new and important downside risk that I had not previously accounted for. We are forecasting the number reported on a specific website, not the raw economic data itself. The possibility that Trading Economics uses a different series (e.g., non-seasonally adjusted) than the one cited in the report, or that its rounding practices could turn a 2.95% into a 3.0%, is a non-trivial risk. This newly considered measurement risk effectively counterbalances the increased confidence I gained on the economic side, leading me to hold my forecast at 85%, albeit with a more robust and nuanced justification.",
