    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of May 7, 2025, Lesotho is not shown as Available on Starlink’s map.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Post-license administrative steps (type approvals, local entity/commercial arrangements, import/logistics) take longer than expected; Starlink prioritizes other markets; the website map remains at Coming Soon/Planned through June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the April 14 license, Starlink completes compliance steps and flips service live; the map updates to show Lesotho as Available (even if sales/logistics are still ramping), consistent with Starlink’s pattern of rapid activations post-approval in several African countries.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence: Lesotho reportedly granted Starlink a license on Apr 14, 2025. Starlink often moves from approval to availability within weeks to a few months in African markets, especially when using laser backhaul rather than local gateways. The small size of Lesotho and prior rapid rollouts in neighboring/similar markets suggest technical feasibility and limited incremental complexity once regulatory clearance is in place.\n- Status quo weighting: Today the map does not show availability; if nothing changes, the default outcome by July 1 is No. However, because the license was only recently granted, the base rate for Starlink flipping countries to Available within 1–3 months post-approval is nontrivial, so I lean above 50%.\n- Why not higher: Uncertainties about remaining regulatory steps (e.g., type approval, retail/reseller arrangements, customs), Starlink’s internal prioritization, and the possibility the website lags actual service readiness. Some African approvals have seen months-long delays before the map turns green.\n- Why not lower: Recent approval timing leaves ~7 weeks, which is often enough for Starlink to update the map. Prior African rollouts (e.g., Zimbabwe, Botswana, Zambia) frequently moved quickly after licensing.\n- Update triggers upward: Any official Starlink/X announcement of Lesotho service, LCA publication of type approvals, local reseller partnerships, or reported deliveries/activations in-country.\n- Update triggers downward: Signals of additional conditions (e.g., spectrum fee disputes, import restrictions), or a Starlink map update roadmap showing Lesotho later than Q3 2025.\n- Research assistant input: No additional info available, so forecast relies on known approval date, Starlink rollout patterns, and timeline remaining.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Lesotho as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lesotho grants license to Musk's Starlink](https://www.ewn.co.za/2025/04/14/lesotho-grants-license-to-musks-starlink)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Lesotho listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
