    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 52 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (the page currently shows Active; if nothing changes to Closed by July 1, the outcome is No)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS effectiveness checks take longer than expected, product can’t be fully accounted for, or the recall is expanded or updated with new reports of injuries/complaints, keeping the status Active into July.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "FSIS verifies product control/disposition and completes effectiveness checks, and updates the recall status from Active to Closed sometime in May or June, before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and timing: The recall was posted April 5, 2025. As of May 9, it has been Active for ~5 weeks. By July 1, it will be ~12.5 weeks old. Historically, many FSIS meat/poultry recalls—especially foreign-matter Class II recalls without illnesses—are closed within roughly 1–3 months, making closure by July 1 plausible to likely. \n- Status quo weighting: The current status is Active, and if we simply extrapolate today forward with no change, the resolution would be No. However, in this domain the ‘status quo’ typically transitions to Closed after effectiveness checks. Given base rates for similar FSIS recalls, I give more than 50% weight to closure before July 1 despite the current Active status. \n- Case specifics: The issue is foreign matter contamination (cheddar bratwurst, ~22,000 lbs). No information about illnesses or severe injuries is noted in the background link; such recalls often resolve faster than pathogen-related Class I events. Johnsonville is a large, experienced firm, which usually facilitates prompt completion of FSIS effectiveness checks. \n- Why not higher: Delays are common—expanded distribution findings, additional consumer complaints, or administrative backlog can push closure past 3 months. Any expansion or update would notably reduce the chance of closure by July 1. \n- Why not lower: Most similar foreign-matter recalls close within the 60–90 day window. With ~52 days left, there is ample time for FSIS to complete checks and post a closure before July 1. \n- What would move me up: FSIS posts an effectiveness update, no expansions by early June, or other signals that product accounting is complete. \n- What would move me down: Any recall expansion/update, reports of injuries, discovery of additional affected lots/states, or evidence of lingering product in commerce past mid-June. \n- Research assistant: No additional information provided; forecast relies on base rates and typical FSIS timelines for similar recalls.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Johnsonville LLC of cheddar bratwurst for foreign matter contamination issued April 5, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReal Simple: [Over 22,000 Pounds of a Popular Sausage Brand Recalled Due to Contamination](https://www.realsimple.com/sausage-recall-2025-11711268)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/johnsonville-llc-recalls-cheddar-bratwurst-product-due-possible-foreign-matter) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
