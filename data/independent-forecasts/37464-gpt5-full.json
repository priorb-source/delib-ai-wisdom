  "information": "LPK1, a Renton, Washington establishment, is recalling approximately 303 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken Caesar wrap products. The recall was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, as the Caesar dressing packet contains fish (anchovies) which is not declared on the product label. The recall is designated as Class II. The affected products were produced on February 15, 17, and 19, 2025. The corresponding 'best by' dates were February 21, 23, and 25, 2025, and the lot codes were LPK1WA046, LPK1WA048, and LPK1WA050.\n\nThe recalled chicken Caesar wraps were distributed to vending machines located in office buildings within the state of Washington. The labeling issue was discovered by the company during a routine quality assurance check of ingredient labels. As of early May 2025, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions or illnesses due to the consumption of these products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has urged consumers and offices not to consume or serve the products and to either return them or dispose of them.\n\nThe recall was issued on February 24, 2025. According to the FSIS recall webpage, the status of the recall remained 'Active' as of May 8, 2025. The general FSIS process for closing a recall requires verification that all affected product has been accounted for and removed from commerce, and confirmation that the company has implemented appropriate corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 24 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall remains listed as Active on or after June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS verification or paperwork lags (e.g., accounting for all product or confirming corrective actions), or the agency batches status updates later, so the recall remains Active into June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "LPK1 provides final documentation that all affected wraps are accounted for and corrective actions are in place; FSIS processes the close-out and switches status to Closed in mid-to-late May.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: The recall (Class II) was posted Feb 24, 2025, covers about 303 lbs of ready-to-eat chicken Caesar wraps distributed to vending machines in Washington only. Best-by dates were Feb 21–25, 2025. As of May 8, FSIS shows the recall as Active; no illnesses reported. \n- Base rates and timing: Small, limited-distribution, allergen/misbranding recalls often close in roughly 2–4 months once FSIS verifies removal from commerce and corrective actions. We are ~10 weeks post-initiation and ~3.5 weeks from the June 1 deadline. Given the small scope and expired product, all affected items were likely out of commerce by early March, so the remaining step is documentation/verification and FSIS processing. \n- Status quo weighting: The current status is Active. With only ~24 days left, inertia and agency processing timelines matter. Many FSIS recall closures occur in batches or after documentation cycles; being Active at ~10 weeks slightly tilts toward remaining Active into early June. \n- Why not higher: It’s already been >2 months without closure, suggesting either ongoing verification or processing delay. With limited time left, even a routine close-out could slip past June 1. \n- Why not lower: The recall is very small, geographically limited, and the product expired months ago. Those factors support a relatively straightforward close-out that could plausibly occur in late May (around the 90-day mark). \n- What would move me up: Any FSIS update indicating documentation is complete or evidence of recent similar small recalls being closed around the 80–100 day mark; company statement that close-out package submitted/accepted. \n- What would move me down: Any expansion of the recall, difficulty locating product through vending channels, or signs of FSIS backlog/slowdowns extending other small recalls beyond three months.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nLPK1, a Renton, Washington establishment, is recalling approximately 303 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken Caesar wrap products.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
