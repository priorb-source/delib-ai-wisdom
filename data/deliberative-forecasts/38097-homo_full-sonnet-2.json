    "review": "All three forecasters converged on a high probability (85-92%), which strengthens confidence in this range. The core reasoning is consistent: Laurent Gbagbo appears already disqualified as of late May 2025 due to his 2018 conviction and loss of civic rights, with multiple sources confirming he 'remains struck from the electoral list.' Forecaster 3 raises an important nuance I hadn't fully weighted - the distinction between ongoing ineligibility from 2018 versus a formal 'removal from the electoral list' specifically for 2025. This is a valid interpretation concern. However, the resolution criteria explicitly state 'removed from the electoral list OR otherwise become legally ineligible' (emphasis mine), which should cover ongoing ineligibility. The phrase 'remains struck' suggests current exclusion status. Forecaster 2's analysis of the political context is thorough and aligns with mine - the pattern of opposition disqualifications (Thiam, Blé Goudé, Soro) demonstrates authorities' willingness to exclude candidates. The PPA-CI's planned June evaluation, mentioned by all of us, indicates they acknowledge current disqualified status while hoping for reversal. No forecaster introduced evidence suggesting Gbagbo isn't currently disqualified or that other candidates face imminent disqualification. The 32-day window remains very short for significant status changes. The convergence around 85-92% suggests appropriate calibration.",
    "rationale": "I'm adjusting slightly downward from 92% to 91% to give marginally more weight to the interpretation uncertainty raised by Forecaster 3. However, I maintain high confidence because: (1) the resolution criteria's 'or otherwise become legally ineligible' language should cover Gbagbo's ongoing ineligibility, (2) multiple independent sources confirm his current excluded status, (3) the legal basis (2018 conviction with civic rights loss) appears solid, (4) only one of five candidates needs disqualification for Yes, (5) the 32-day remaining window is very short for reversal, and (6) the political context shows systematic opposition exclusions. The main downside risks remain: potential reporting errors, unexpected legal reversal, or extremely narrow interpretation that 2018 ineligibility doesn't count. But these risks are limited given the evidence strength and short timeframe.",
