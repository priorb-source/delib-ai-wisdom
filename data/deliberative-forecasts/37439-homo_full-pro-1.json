    "review": "The other two forecasters reached the same 30% probability, and their reasoning is highly convergent with my own. We all identified the same core tension: the official diplomatic signaling from the Kremlin, which points to a slow, methodical process for a future summit, versus the potential for a 'Yes' outcome driven by a sudden geopolitical crisis or an impulsive decision by Donald Trump. Both forecasters correctly highlighted the Kremlin's emphasis on 'adequate preparation' as the key piece of evidence supporting a 'No' outcome, and both cited the volatile situation in Ukraine and Trump's diplomatic style as the primary arguments for a 'Yes' outcome. They did not raise any new evidence or arguments I hadn't considered. Their analyses serve as a strong confirmation of my initial assessment, and the consensus increases my confidence in the forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other expert analyses, I am maintaining my forecast at 30%. The strong consensus among all three forecasters reinforces my initial reasoning without introducing new evidence that would warrant a change. My rationale remains anchored in the conflicting signals from the key actors. On the one hand, the most recent and direct evidence comes from the Kremlin, whose spokesperson has explicitly stated the need for 'adequate preparation' for a future meeting and that 'no specific details or a set date' exist. This language strongly suggests a move towards a more formal, and therefore slower, diplomatic process, making an ad-hoc phone call within the short 34-day resolution window (May 12 - June 15) less probable. This official posture forms the basis for my 'No'-leaning forecast. On the other hand, the 30% probability accounts for significant wildcards. First, a precedent for direct communication exists with the two calls earlier in the year. Second, an unforeseen crisis, particularly concerning Ukraine, could easily necessitate an urgent call, overriding any previously stated plans. Finally, Donald Trump's preference for personal, top-level diplomacy could lead him to initiate a call to cut through the preparatory stages. These factors prevent a lower forecast. The convergence of forecasts confirms that this balance of a slow official track against high-impact wildcards is the central dynamic of this question.",
