  "information": "In the first five months of 2025, three countries signed the Artemis Accords: Finland (January 23), Bangladesh (April 8), and Norway (May 15), bringing the total number of signatories to 55. This follows the signings of Panama and Austria in December 2024. In a statement on May 22, 2025, acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro said that NASA anticipates additional countries will sign the accords in the coming weeks and months.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (window: after May 30, 2025 through June 30, 2025; effectively the month of June, with May 31 also counting)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Talks continue but slip past June; prospective signings are timed to later events (e.g., July bilateral visits or fall conferences), and no country completes domestic clearances in time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A country formalizes during June on the sidelines of a major venue (e.g., UN COPUOS session in Vienna or the Paris Air Show) or via a bilateral ceremony—plausible candidates include Portugal, a Southeast Asian partner (e.g., Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam), a Gulf state (Oman, Qatar, Kuwait), or a Latin American or African partner (e.g., Costa Rica, Morocco, South Africa).",
    "rationale": "- Base rate: In 2025 so far, 3 signings in 5 months (~0.6/month). A simple Poisson framing gives P(at least one in a given month) ≈ 1 - e^-0.6 ≈ 45%.\n- Fresh momentum: Finland (Jan 23), Bangladesh (Apr 8), Norway (May 15) show ongoing cadence. The pool of potential signers remains large despite many European and Americas signers already on board.\n- Near-term signals: On May 22, acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro said NASA anticipates additional countries will sign in the coming weeks and months, which points to elevated odds for June specifically.\n- Event timing: June offers two natural stages for announcements—UN COPUOS in Vienna (often a hotspot for space diplomacy signings) and the 2025 Paris Air Show—both increase coordination opportunities for ceremonies.\n- Status quo weighting: Even with positive signals, international signings are lumpy and slip for domestic or scheduling reasons. Many months see no new signers. The default outcome (no June signing) still has meaningful probability.\n- Why not higher: Timelines often slide; some candidates may be hedging geopolitically or awaiting internal approvals. The recent May 15 signing could push the next announcement into July to avoid clustering.\n- Why not lower: Clear recent cadence, explicit NASA guidance about imminent additions, and June’s convenings all argue for better-than-base odds.\n- What would move me up: Credible press advisories, leaks of a specific country completing cabinet/legislative approvals, or agenda mentions of an Artemis ceremony at COPUOS/Paris Air Show. If a reputable outlet reports a planned June signing, I’d move to 75–85%.\n- What would move me down: Mid-June passes without credible chatter; reports that target countries are deferring to July/August; indications of domestic hurdles in likely candidates. In that case, I’d drift toward 30–40%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025. There are 55 signatories at the time of this question: Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay. [(source)](https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-oceans-and-international-environmental-and-scientific-affairs/artemis-accords)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country becomes an Artemis Accord signatory after May 30, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn the first five months of 2025, three countries signed the Artemis Accords: Finland (January 23), Bangladesh (April 8), and Norway (May 15), bringing the total number of signatories to 55. This follows the signings of Panama and Austria in December 2024. In a statement on May 22, 2025, acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro said that NASA anticipates additional countries will sign the accords in the coming weeks and months.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
