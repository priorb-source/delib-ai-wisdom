    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The political crisis surrounding the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol de-escalates rapidly. For instance, the President resigns or is removed by the Constitutional Court early in the forecast period, and the public is satisfied with the outcome. Protest movements lose their primary impetus, and no other major issue emerges to mobilize over 10,000 people in May or June 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A development in the impeachment proceedings, a controversial government policy, or a significant political anniversary triggers at least one large-scale protest. Continuing the pattern seen since late 2024, civic groups and opposition supporters organize a demonstration in Seoul or another major city that surpasses 10,000 participants, and this event is subsequently recorded by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the intense political climate in South Korea following President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law declaration in December 2024. The provided background information from ACLED confirms a 'surge' in anti-government protests during that period, establishing a strong recent precedent for mass mobilization. South Korea has a robust civil society and a history of large-scale street protests as a form of political expression. The impeachment process against the president is a significant and ongoing source of public grievance, making further large demonstrations highly probable. The forecast period of two months is relatively short, suggesting that the political inertia from the crisis will likely persist. A single event exceeding the 10,000 participant threshold is a low bar in this context. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because there is a possibility that the political situation could stabilize unexpectedly, for example, through a swift resolution of the impeachment that satisfies the public, leading to a decrease in protest activity. There is also a small chance of a lag or omission in the Global Protest Tracker's reporting. \n\nMy forecast is not lower because the political divisions are deep, and the opposition and civic groups appear highly motivated to maintain pressure on the government. It would be more surprising for two full months to pass without a single major protest given the gravity of the recent political crisis. I would raise my forecast if a new major political scandal erupts or a contentious court ruling is scheduled for May or June. I would lower it if key opposition and protest leaders call for a pause in demonstrations to focus on the legal impeachment process.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in South Korea with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nACLED December 2024: [South Korea: Anti-government protests surge following martial law declaration](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/#keytrends6)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in South Korea with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
