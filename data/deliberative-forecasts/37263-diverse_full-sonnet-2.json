    "review": "Both forecasters provide strong analyses that align closely with my initial reasoning. Forecaster 2 makes a compelling point about the complete absence of any public evidence of Uber's interest in TCI, emphasizing that major market entries rarely happen without prior signals. Their 2% forecast reflects appropriate skepticism. Forecaster 3's 8% forecast gives more weight to the 'Uber Taxi' partnership model scenario, motivated by tourism demand and the precedent in Curitiba. However, I find this optimistic - even partnership models require advance work, regulatory engagement, and public signals that are entirely absent here. The key insight all three of us share is that the structural barriers (small market, short timeline, regulatory caution, existing competitors, no signals) are overwhelming. The narrow disagreement is about the tail probability of a surprise rapid partnership. Forecaster 2's emphasis on zero public evidence is particularly strong - Uber's standard practice involves announcements, pilot programs, and visible preparation. The tourism boom argument from Forecaster 3 is noted but doesn't overcome the fundamental issue that we're 60 days out with no indication whatsoever of Uber activity. Even 'fast' partnerships take longer than 2 months from conception to launch.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward. The complete absence of any public signals - no press releases, no regulatory filings, no job postings, no partnership announcements, no local reporting - is a stronger indicator than I initially weighted. While I still can't completely rule out a pre-existing secret arrangement or surprise acquisition (hence not going to 1%), the probability should reflect that such scenarios are extraordinarily rare. The 60-day timeline is insufficient even for expedited partnership models. The Curitiba 'Uber Taxi' example that multiple forecasters cited involved visible planning and announcements. The regulatory environment in TCI appears protective of existing licensed operators, not welcoming to new entrants. The tourism statistics, while impressive, don't change the fundamental calculus that this is a tiny market with established competitors where Uber has shown no interest. My updated forecast of 3% acknowledges these stronger-than-initially-weighted barriers while maintaining a small tail for truly unexpected developments.",
