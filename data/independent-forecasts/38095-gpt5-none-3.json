    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month (until June 30, 2025; plus any short lag for public disclosure).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — zero to two clemency grants are publicly disclosed for June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The White House does not run a June clemency tranche, instead timing a batch around July 4 or later in the year. Any June signatures are held for announcement in July, or the month sees only one or two individualized grants (e.g., a single high-profile ally plus one other).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump issues a small batch of pardons/commutations in June (e.g., 3–10 names) or announces a blanket/targeted clemency covering a class (such as certain January 6 defendants), and it’s publicly disclosed before the end of June.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: In Trump’s first term, clemency actions tended to arrive in sporadic clusters rather than steadily; only a minority of months had more than a couple of grants. That suggests a month-level base rate on the order of ~15–25% for seeing >2 grants in any given month. Status quo therefore leans No.\nUpside factors: The threshold is low (only 3 needed). In a second term, Trump has both motive and precedent for batch actions, and blanket/targeted clemency for January 6 defendants is plausible. The cited Guardian piece (May 2, 2025) indicates an active clemency environment this year, implying some cadence of grants and raising the chance that any random month crosses the threshold. Late June could also be used to shape headlines after court decisions.\nDownside factors: Trump often times clemency for symbolic dates; July 4 is more likely than June. Even if some grants are signed in late June, public disclosure might slide into early July, which would not count under these rules. Many months historically had zero activity.\nWhy not higher: June is not a typical symbolic month, and disclosure timing risk is real. Why not lower: The bar is very low (>2), Trump’s pattern favors batches when he acts, and blanket grants would trivially satisfy the criterion.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting of a June clemency list in prep, leaks about a June tranche (especially tied to Jan 6 cases), or a WH signal about near-term pardons/commutations. What would move me down: Reporting that a major clemency package is slated for July 4 or later, indications of internal delays or a pause pending court rulings, or signs that disclosures will be bundled in July.\nResearch assistant summary: No additional specifics were available, so I’m leaning on historical patterns, the low threshold, and the general signal from current-year media coverage that clemency is active.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump grant executive clemency to more than 2 individuals in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nGuardian: [Trump white-collar criminal pardons cost public $1bn, says ex-DoJ official](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/02/trump-pardons-cost-liz-oyer)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Donald J. Trump grants [executive clemency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_granted_executive_clemency_in_the_second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump) to greater than 2 individuals in June 2025.\n\nPartial pardons or clemencies count. They will only count if publicly disclosed. Wide-reaching blanket pardons or commutations also count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
