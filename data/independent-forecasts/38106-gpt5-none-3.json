    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 31 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No Russia trip is announced or signaled; the White House calendar fills with domestic priorities and/or other international engagements. Any Trump–Putin contact, if it occurs, happens via phone or a third country rather than on Russian soil.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid, high-profile summit in Moscow or St. Petersburg is arranged and publicly framed as an effort to negotiate on Ukraine (ceasefire/hostage swap) or reset bilateral ties. The Kremlin and White House announce it days in advance, or credible leaks appear followed by formal confirmation, and Trump flies to Russia in June.",
    "rationale": "Baseline is strongly No. U.S.–Russia relations remain severely strained amid the war in Ukraine and extensive sanctions. A presidential visit to Russia would be unprecedentedly controversial, logistically complex, and typically requires weeks of advance planning and signaling; none has surfaced. In Trump’s first term he never visited Russia (meeting Putin instead in third countries like Helsinki), which is a useful precedent. The narrow window (just June) further suppresses odds. A surprise, same-month presidential trip to Russia would face significant security, diplomatic, and political hurdles, making it highly improbable. Why not lower than this? Trump’s unpredictability and personal inclination toward deal-making create a small tail risk of a quickly arranged summit if both sides saw immediate benefit (e.g., a dramatic ceasefire framework or prisoner swap). What would move me up: credible, named-source reporting of an imminent Trump–Putin meeting in Russia; official statements from the White House/Kremlin; visible advance team activity; airspace/logistics clues; a Europe trip on the schedule that could be extended to Russia. What would move me down: explicit denials from U.S. officials; firm scheduling elsewhere that crowds out June; fresh escalations or sanctions that make a visit politically or logistically infeasible. Research assistant provided no additional information; thus the forecast leans heavily on status quo patterns and constraints.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit Russia before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits Russia.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
