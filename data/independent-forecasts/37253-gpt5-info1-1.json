  "information": "North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, with the last one occurring in September 2017. The current gap of over seven and a half years is the longest interval between tests. According to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS), the tunnels at the Punggye-ri test site are maintained in an operational condition. The U.S. State Department also assesses that the site remains capable of supporting a seventh test. The IAEA has warned about an 'exponential' expansion of North Korea's nuclear program and ongoing plutonium production at the Yongbyon facility. However, analysis of satellite imagery by the think tank 38 North shows no new tunneling activity at Punggye-ri, and there are no public reports of specific preparations such as equipment movement or other logistical arrangements that would typically precede a test.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "North Korea continues missile and space launches plus aggressive rhetoric, but refrains from a nuclear detonation. Punggye-ri remains maintained but without the telltale last-mile logistics (new tunneling, cable spools, equipment staging, VIP/security movements). Beijing quietly discourages a provocation; Pyongyang preserves ambiguity and avoids additional sanctions pressure.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kim orders a politically timed underground test at Punggye-ri—potentially to validate a tactical nuclear warhead or design change, or to respond to US–ROK exercises or a late-June anniversary. Short-notice preparations occur largely out of public view; the IMS and global seismology detect an event, with rapid confirmation by governments and major outlets.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo: No test since Sept 2017 despite multiple windows of heightened tension. With only ~2 months left, the baseline hazard is low. Historically, DPRK often signals in imagery and logistics before testing; current open-source imagery (per 38 North) shows no new tunneling and no specific last-mile preparations. This weighs heavily toward No in the short window.\n- Capability: The Punggye-ri site appears maintained and capable (per ROK NIS, U.S. assessments). IAEA notes continued nuclear material production and program expansion. So a test is feasible on short notice, preventing the probability from being near zero.\n- Incentives: Reasons to test include validating new warhead designs (e.g., tactical devices) and political signaling. Countervailing factors include likely Chinese disapproval, risk of tightened sanctions, and the regime’s apparent confidence in existing designs after six tests. Seasonality also nudges slightly against a test before July; past tests cluster in Jan/Feb and September, with only one in late spring (May 2009).\n- Net: Given feasibility but absent proximate indicators and with very limited time left, I assign a modest but non-trivial chance.\n- Why not higher: No current public indications of imminent preparations, long-standing restraint since 2017 despite multiple flashpoints, and potential Chinese constraint.\n- Why not lower: Site readiness, ongoing fissile production, and DPRK’s propensity for surprise actions, including possible timing around late-June anniversaries or responses to allied exercises.\n- What would move me up: Fresh satellite evidence of last-mile test prep at Punggye-ri (equipment staging, cables/power lines to portals, renewed excavation at Tunnel 3/4, unusual security/VIP activity), authoritative leaks or statements from ROK/US intel warning an imminent test, escalatory crises coinciding with major exercises or a specific political milestone.\n- What would move me down: Credible reporting of degradation or flooding/closure at Punggye-ri, visible de-escalatory diplomacy with China applying pressure, or a stretch of detailed imagery showing deliberate stand-down of the site during this window.\nSummary of assistant’s report used: Six prior tests (last in 2017), site assessed as operational by NIS and U.S., IAEA notes program expansion, 38 North sees no new tunneling or specific preparations. These inputs anchor my low but non-zero probability within a short time horizon.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill North Korea test a nuclear weapon before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and in 2017.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting such as the [International Monitoring System’s ](https://www.ctbto.org/our-work/detecting-nuclear-tests) and the sources cited at Wikipedia's [List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNorth Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, with the last one occurring in September 2017.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
