  "information": "Protests have been ongoing in Turkey since the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu on March 19, 2025, on corruption charges. Reports from various news outlets cited turnouts in the hundreds of thousands. The Republican People's Party (CHP) claimed that over 2 million people participated in a protest in Istanbul on March 29. The party announced plans for continued protests. Following the initial wave of demonstrations, Turkish authorities detained 1,133 people between March 19 and March 23. In response to the protests, nearly 1,900 people, including journalists, had been rounded up by late March.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, Labor Day events in Istanbul included authorized marches and unauthorized protests. According to the Istanbul Governor's Office, authorized marches in the Kadıköy and Kartal districts had a combined participation of around 65,000 people. Authorities deployed over 52,000 police officers. Clashes occurred during attempts to hold unauthorized demonstrations, particularly near Taksim Square, leading to the detention of 384 people. A court later ordered the release of 374 of those detained, while others were released on bail or remained in custody.\n\nTurkey's high inflation rate was reported at approximately 48.6% in early 2025. In the legal sphere, an indictment was prepared for 14 youths arrested during the Saraçhane protests, with their first hearing scheduled for May 30, 2025. Separately, the trial for manager Ayşe Barım, related to her alleged role in the 2013 Gezi Park protests, is scheduled for July 7, 2025. Amnesty International's 2024-25 report highlighted what it described as human rights violations in Turkey, including restrictions on peaceful protests and the prosecution of journalists and opposition figures. The organization also condemned the arrests made ahead of the May 1st protests and called for the lifting of the ban on demonstrations in Taksim Square.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days (from May 7, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the question resolves positively",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker fails to report any of the recent Turkish protests despite their large size, either because they don't meet the tracker's specific inclusion criteria, there are significant delays in their reporting process, or the tracker's methodology filters out these particular events. Additionally, increased police crackdowns successfully prevent any new protests from reaching 10,000 participants.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker reports one or more of the already-occurred large protests (March 19 onwards, May 1 Labor Day events) that clearly exceeded 10,000 participants, or new large-scale protests continue as the CHP has announced and these are documented by the tracker before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly indicates that multiple protests well exceeding 10,000 participants have occurred in Turkey since mid-March 2025. The research assistant reports hundreds of thousands participating, with CHP claiming over 2 million in Istanbul on March 29. Even the authorized May 1 marches alone had approximately 65,000 participants. These are major, internationally-covered political events. The critical question is whether the Global Protest Tracker will report these events, not whether they occurred. Factors favoring a Yes outcome: (1) The protests are massive, well-documented, and ongoing; (2) The CHP has announced continued protests amid high political tension; (3) Turkey's 48.6% inflation rate and arrest of a major opposition mayor create conditions for sustained unrest; (4) We have 55 days remaining for either reporting of past events or occurrence of new large protests; (5) The Global Protest Tracker is specifically designed to document major global protests. Factors creating uncertainty: (1) We lack direct confirmation the tracker has already logged these events; (2) The tracker may have specific inclusion criteria, verification standards, or reporting delays we're unaware of; (3) Heavy police presence (52,000+ officers deployed) and mass detentions (1,900+ arrested) might suppress future large gatherings. The status quo strongly points toward Yes given the scale and documentation of events. I'm not forecasting higher (90%+) because of uncertainty about the specific reporting practices and criteria of the Global Protest Tracker. I'm not forecasting lower (60-70%) because the protests are extraordinarily large, well-documented by multiple sources, and the political situation remains volatile with announced plans for continuation.",
