  "information": "According to media reports citing the Kremlin, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held phone conversations on February 12, 2025, and March 18, 2025. The February call reportedly lasted nearly 90 minutes. The March call was to discuss the war in Ukraine and a potential 30-day ceasefire proposal. On April 4, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that no phone conversations between the leaders were planned for the near future.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known on or before June 15, 2025, which is approximately 40 days from today's date of May 6, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The period between May 13, 2025, and June 14, 2025, passes without any acute international crisis or major breakthrough in negotiations concerning the war in Ukraine. Diplomatic contacts continue through lower-level channels, and the April 4 Kremlin statement that no calls were planned for the near future holds true throughout this window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant development occurs in the resolution window, such as a major battlefield event in Ukraine, a new, credible peace proposal, or another international crisis requiring direct leader-to-leader intervention. This prompts an urgent call, which is subsequently acknowledged by both the White House and the Kremlin.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 35% balances the established precedent for communication against the high bar for such calls and the current official stance. \n\nThe primary evidence supporting a potential 'Yes' outcome is the two phone calls that have already occurred this year, on February 12 and March 18. This demonstrates a willingness from both leaders to engage in direct dialogue, likely centered on the war in Ukraine. The geopolitical situation remains volatile, and any number of events could necessitate another urgent conversation within the specified one-month window.\n\nHowever, several factors weigh against this. The status quo, which good forecasting privileges, is 'no call'. This is reinforced by the Kremlin's explicit statement on April 4, 2025, that no phone calls were planned for the 'near future'. As of today, May 6, we are still within a reasonable interpretation of that timeframe. Head-of-state calls are not routine; they are significant diplomatic events typically reserved for major developments. It is more likely than not that the one-month window from mid-May to mid-June will pass without a development deemed urgent enough to require a direct call.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the Kremlin's statement explicitly lowers expectations, and the flurry of calls earlier in the year may have addressed the most pressing issues for the time being. It is not lower because the war in Ukraine creates a persistently unstable environment where the need for a high-level call could arise with very little warning. An open and recently used channel of communication between the two leaders makes another call significantly more plausible than it would be otherwise.\n\nI would increase my probability forecast upon news of a significant escalation in Ukraine or credible reports that a peace summit or major agreement is imminent. I would decrease it if either side made public statements explicitly ruling out a conversation in this timeframe or if a major diplomatic rift were to occur.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both Trump and Putin, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to media reports citing the Kremlin, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held phone conversations on February 12, 2025, and March 18, 2025. The February call reportedly lasted nearly 90 minutes. The March call was to discuss the war in Ukraine and a potential 30-day ceasefire proposal. On April 4, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that no phone conversations between the leaders were planned for the near future.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
