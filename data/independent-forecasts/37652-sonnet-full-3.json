  "information": "Following his election win on April 28, 2025, Prime Minister Mark Carney presented a new, smaller cabinet of 29 ministers, down from 39 in the previous administration. Key figures such as François-Philippe Champagne (Finance) and Dominic LeBlanc (US Trade) were retained. Carney's government announced it would not table a full federal budget before the summer, opting for a fall economic statement instead. The new administration's immediate promises include a tax cut and the elimination of all inter-provincial trade barriers by July 1. Carney signed a symbolic decree to lower the first taxable income bracket from 15% to 14%, a measure requiring parliamentary approval. The Liberal party's platform includes additional spending that projects the national deficit for 2025-26 to be $62.3 billion Canadian dollars, an increase from the $42.2 billion forecast in December.\n\nThe relationship with the United States under President Donald Trump was a central theme of the recent Canadian election. Trump had made public remarks about absorbing Canada into the U.S. and imposed tariffs on Canadian goods. In response, Prime Minister Carney stated his government would 'relentlessly' protect Canadian sovereignty and work to define a new economic and security relationship with Washington. After the election, Carney met with Trump but did not secure a removal of the U.S. tariffs. Carney has stated he will maintain Canadian tariffs on U.S. products as long as American tariffs remain in place. The new Canadian cabinet has been explicitly tasked with focusing on Canada-U.S. relations and resolving trade disputes.\n\nPolling data from the period leading up to the April 28, 2025, snap election showed a significant shift in public opinion. After trailing by more than 20 points at the start of the year, the Liberal party under Mark Carney experienced a major comeback. A March 23 Ipsos poll reported Carney's approval rating at 48% with 30% disapproval, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre had 35% approval and 52% disapproval. Some outlets cited the same poll as showing Carney with a 71% approval rating. An Abacus Data poll from March 24 found the Conservatives with a national lead of 39% to 36% over the Liberals, but found Carney was the preferred choice for Prime Minister over Poilievre, 38% to 34%. The same poll reported that 77% of Canadians held a negative view of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6-7 weeks. The question resolves on July 1, 2025, and today is May 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Carney likely has a higher approval rating than Trump",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump's approval rating equals or exceeds Carney's. This could occur if Carney's post-election honeymoon period ends abruptly due to policy missteps, economic troubles, or if the US-Canada trade dispute resolves favorably for Trump, boosting his standing. Additionally, if Carney's ambitious spending plans ($62.3B deficit) generate public backlash quickly, his approval could decline rapidly.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Carney maintains higher approval than Trump. This is likely given that Carney is only 9 weeks into his tenure by July 1st, well within the typical 'honeymoon period' for newly elected leaders. The ongoing trade tensions with the US, Trump's historically low approval ratings (typically low-to-mid 40s%), and the fact that 77% of Canadians viewed Trump negatively as of March 2025 all support this outcome.",
    "rationale": "Mark Carney won the April 28, 2025 election and will have been Prime Minister for only about 9 weeks by July 1st. Newly elected leaders typically experience a 'honeymoon period' lasting 3-6 months or longer where approval ratings remain elevated. Pre-election polling showed Carney at 48% approval in March, and election victories typically boost these numbers further.\n\nTrump, in contrast, historically maintains approval ratings in the 35-45% range in the US. While Morning Consult tracks domestic approval (Trump among Americans, Carney among Canadians), Trump's ratings have consistently been below average for US presidents.\n\nThe ongoing trade dispute works against Trump's approval while potentially bolstering Carney's, as he positions himself as defending Canadian sovereignty. The short 6-7 week timeframe makes dramatic shifts unlikely - honeymoon periods don't typically end this quickly absent major crises.\n\nMy forecast is not higher (85%+) because: (1) I lack current Morning Consult baseline data for both leaders; (2) unexpected events could occur; (3) Carney's ambitious deficit spending could generate early backlash; (4) resolution of trade tensions could boost Trump.\n\nMy forecast is not lower (55-60%) because: (1) the honeymoon effect is historically very strong; (2) Trump's approval has been consistently mediocre; (3) the timeframe is too short for typical political dynamics to fully erode a new leader's support; (4) Carney demonstrated electoral success just weeks ago.\n\nI would update higher if: Morning Consult data showed Carney currently at 55%+ and Trump at 40% or below. I would update lower if: early polling showed Carney's approval declining rapidly, or if a major Trump policy success emerged.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mark Carney has a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.
