  "information": "According to Baker Hughes data from mid-April 2025, the total number of active drilling rigs in the U.S. rose by 2 to 585. This followed a 7-rig dip in the prior week. The count of oil rigs rose by 1 to 481, and gas rigs also increased by 1 to 98. The total rig count is down by 34 compared to the same period in the previous year. Drilling activity in the Permian basin was steady at 289 rigs, which is 29 fewer than the previous year. The Frac Spread Count, which estimates the number of crews completing wells, fell by 10 to 195.\n\nAs of late April 2025, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices were around $64-$65 per barrel, after the American Petroleum Institute reported a decrease of 4.565 million barrels in U.S. crude oil inventories for the week ending April 18. This price is near the breakeven point for many drilling operations, which is estimated to be around $65 per barrel. A Dallas Fed survey of 130 energy firms in Texas, New Mexico, and Louisiana indicated that firms are dealing with increased costs, reduced rig counts, and layoffs. The survey's company outlook index decreased by 12 points, while the outlook uncertainty index increased by 21 points, with executives citing tariffs on steel (25%) as increasing costs for casing and tubing.\n\nSeveral major energy and service companies reported on their performance in Q1 2025. Halliburton reported declining profits in North America due to decreased drilling activity. Baker Hughes' oilfield services division saw a 10% sequential drop in revenue. In contrast, Occidental Petroleum announced a capital expenditures plan of $7 billion to $7.2 billion for 2025, with $3.7 billion allocated to the Permian Basin. The company plans to operate 24 gross drilling rigs and bring 500 to 550 new wells online in the Permian during the year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately five weeks. The outcome is determined by the report for the week ending May 30, 2025, and today is April 23, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recent rig count provided is 585, which is not less than 583. Therefore, if the rig count remained unchanged, the outcome would be No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "This outcome occurs if the rig count is 583 or higher. This could be driven by a sustained rise in WTI crude prices above the ~$65/bbl breakeven point, prompting producers to maintain or add rigs. Large-scale investment plans from major producers could also counteract the broader trend of declining activity, stabilizing the count around its current level. Simple week-to-week volatility could also result in the count coincidentally landing at or above 583 on the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "This outcome occurs if the active rig count drops by at least three from its current level of 585. This would likely be driven by the continuation of the year-over-year downward trend, influenced by factors cited in the Dallas Fed survey such as high operating costs and economic uncertainty. If WTI oil prices dip below, or even just stagnate at, the $65/bbl breakeven level, it would increase pressure on producers to reduce drilling activity, pushing the count below 583.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong underlying economic pressures pointing towards a continued, albeit slow, decline in drilling activity. The current rig count of 585 is extremely close to the resolution threshold of 583, making the status quo outcome 'No'. However, this proximity also means a very small net change of just three rigs over five weeks would flip the result to 'Yes'. Several factors support this modest decline. The year-over-year trend is strongly negative, with 34 fewer rigs than the previous year. The Dallas Fed survey indicates producers are facing increased costs and uncertainty, leading to reduced activity. Furthermore, oil service companies like Halliburton are reporting declining profits from North American operations, confirming the slowdown. While WTI oil prices are hovering around the breakeven point of ~$65/bbl, this level provides little incentive for expansion and makes the industry sensitive to any price downturns. The planned capital expenditures by some large producers like Occidental Petroleum provide a counteracting force, but this is unlikely to reverse the industry-wide trend of capital discipline.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the rig count is only two units away from the 'No' side of the threshold, and weekly counts are subject to random volatility. A small oil price rally or a batch of wells coming online could easily keep the number at or above 583.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the combination of high costs, economic uncertainty, and stagnant energy prices creates significant downward pressure. The long-term trend is a powerful indicator, and a continuation of this trend, even at a much-reduced pace, would be sufficient to push the count below 583 within the next five weeks.\n\nI would increase my probability for 'Yes' if WTI prices fall below $65 or if the next few weekly reports show a clear downward movement. I would decrease it if WTI prices rise above $70 or if the rig count shows signs of stabilizing or increasing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive.
