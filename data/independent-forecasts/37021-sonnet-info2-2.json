  "information": "The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has maintained its key interest rate at 15.5% in an effort to control inflation. The NBU revised its year-end 2025 inflation forecast to 8.7% and its 2025 GDP growth forecast down to 3.1%. NBU statements indicate an expectation that inflation will peak in the second quarter of 2025 and subsequently decline during the summer, partly due to an anticipated increase in crop yields, which is projected to lower food inflation. The bank has identified ongoing risks including the war, infrastructure damage, and labor shortages.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. April 2025 inflation data is typically released in early May, so the outcome will be known very soon.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - inflation stays below 15%",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine's April inflation remains below 15%, consistent with the National Bank of Ukraine's forecasts. The central bank's year-end projection of 8.7% inflation and expectation that inflation will peak in Q2 before declining suggests April inflation, while possibly elevated, stays in the 9-12% range. Restrictive monetary policy (15.5% key rate) and anticipated agricultural improvements help contain price pressures.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A severe unexpected shock occurs in April - such as major infrastructure damage, significant currency depreciation, energy supply disruptions, or war-related supply chain breakdowns - pushing inflation above the central bank's expectations to 15% or higher. War-related uncertainties materialize more severely than anticipated.",
    "rationale": "The National Bank of Ukraine's forecasts provide crucial guidance here. Their year-end 2025 inflation forecast is 8.7%, and while they expect inflation to peak in Q2 2025 (which includes April), nothing in their guidance suggests a spike to 15% or above. If they anticipated such extreme inflation, their year-end forecast would be substantially higher. The restrictive 15.5% policy rate demonstrates the NBU is actively managing inflation risks. The article headline about stagflation concerns suggests economic challenges, but the specific numerical forecasts don't support a 15% reading. Given we're only days from the data release (April 22 today, data typically released early May), if inflation were trending toward 15%, there would likely be more visible warning signals - currency crisis, panic buying, central bank emergency measures - which haven't been reported. The status quo heavily favors an inflation rate below 15%, likely in the high single digits to low teens. However, Ukraine's wartime economy creates genuine uncertainty - infrastructure attacks, supply disruptions, or currency pressures could theoretically cause unexpected spikes. I'm not going lower because war-related risks are real and data volatility is possible. I'm not going higher because all available evidence points to more moderate inflation levels consistent with central bank projections.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's inflation rate increase to at least 15.0% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's annualized inflation rate is greater than or equal to 15.0% for the month of April 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/inflation-cpi). Under 15.0% resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has maintained its key interest rate at 15.5% in an effort to control inflation. The NBU revised its year-end 2025 inflation forecast to 8.7% and its 2025 GDP growth forecast down to 3.1%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
