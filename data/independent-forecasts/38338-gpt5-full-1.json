  "information": "In mid-May 2025, John Morgan stated he would observe the field of announced candidates before making a decision on running for governor. He also mentioned that if he were to run, his campaign would be brief, lasting approximately three months. Morgan has publicly considered running for governor in previous election cycles, including 2018 and 2022, but ultimately did not enter the races.\n\nProminent attorney John Morgan has announced plans to launch a new political party aimed at centrist voters, expressing dissatisfaction with the current two-party system. Multiple news outlets reported in February and May 2025 that Morgan has been working on this initiative for months, with lawyers preparing party-formation paperwork for what has been referred to as the 'Capitalist Party' or '#ForThePeople'.\n\nThe field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race has seen recent developments. On June 5, 2025, former Republican Congressman David Jolly announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination. Additionally, State Senator Jason Pizzo has stated his intention to run as an independent. On the Republican side, Congressman Byron Donalds has launched his campaign, and Florida's First Lady, Casey DeSantis, is reportedly considering a run.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 24 days (until June 30, 2025 inclusive)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Morgan continues to tease and build his new centrist party without formally declaring for governor, saying he’ll watch the field and decide later; June ends with no explicit candidacy announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Morgan holds a press event or posts on social media formally declaring he’s running for Florida governor—either under a new party banner, as an independent, or within a major party—before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and status quo: It is early in the 2026 cycle, and Morgan has publicly said he wants to watch the field and, if he runs, conduct a short (~3‑month) campaign. That strongly points to not announcing this far out. The default is inaction over the next three weeks. \n- Track record/base rate: Morgan has floated gubernatorial runs before (2018, 2022) and did not enter. His base rate of actually pulling the trigger is low. \n- New party dynamics: He is reportedly forming a centrist party (Capitalist Party/#ForThePeople). That can proceed without an immediate candidacy announcement; indeed, a short campaign later would be consistent with his stated preference. Launching a party now does not require announcing a candidacy by July 1. \n- Field developments: Since June 5, David Jolly entered the Democratic race and Jason Pizzo signaled an independent run. These reduce the immediate strategic need for Morgan to declare; he can observe how these bids develop. Republican Byron Donalds is in, and Casey DeSantis may run—again, reasons to wait and see. \n- Why not higher: Only ~24 days remain; his history of non-entry; stated desire for a brief campaign; and the fresh entries (Jolly, Pizzo) all tilt toward waiting. \n- Why not lower: Morgan is actively exploring, has ample resources to make a sudden announcement, enjoys publicity, and could pair a party-launch moment with a candidacy declaration to maximize attention. A surprise is possible though not likely. \n- What would raise my forecast: Concrete steps toward a campaign before July 1 (e.g., FEC/State filings, hiring key staff, reserving domains/social handles, scheduled press conference, credible leaks of an imminent announcement, formal registration of his new party with clear gubernatorial nomination plans now). \n- What would lower my forecast: Public statements deferring any decision until later in 2025/2026, endorsement of another candidate, indications of health/business constraints, or reports that party formation will continue without a named gubernatorial candidate this summer.",
