    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (46 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no human cases have been reported",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "HKU5-CoV-2 remains confined to animal populations (likely bats or other wildlife based on the HKU designation from coronavirus surveillance programs). No zoonotic spillover occurs in the remaining 6 weeks, or any potential spillover events go undetected or unreported by credible health authorities before the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A zoonotic spillover event occurs where HKU5-CoV-2 infects at least one human through contact with infected animals or contaminated environments. The case is detected through surveillance systems and officially reported by WHO, CDC, or other credible health authorities before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The base rate for novel coronavirus spillover is quite low. Surveillance programs regularly identify hundreds of novel coronaviruses in animal populations, but only a handful have ever caused documented human infections. The HKU designation suggests this comes from coronavirus surveillance in Hong Kong/China, which routinely identifies bat coronaviruses that pose theoretical but typically unrealized spillover risks.\n\nThe extremely short timeframe (only 6 weeks remaining) significantly limits the probability. For a YES resolution, not only would a spillover event need to occur, but it would also need to be detected and officially reported by credible sources within this narrow window.\n\nThe status quo strongly favors NO - the question hasn't resolved yet, implying no human cases have been reported to date. If this virus were discovered months or years ago without human cases, this reinforces that it likely has low spillover potential or limited human contact opportunities.\n\nHowever, the existence of this question suggests some level of concern or risk assessment that motivated its creation. There may be factors (research exposures, virus characteristics, geographic proximity to humans) that create non-negligible risk.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: (1) Most novel coronaviruses never infect humans, (2) The timeframe is extremely short, (3) No cases have been reported yet despite presumed ongoing surveillance, (4) The research assistant provided no concerning additional information.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: (1) The question's existence implies some rational concern, (2) We have recent precedent (COVID-19) showing novel coronaviruses can emerge, (3) Spillover events, while rare, do occur, (4) Six weeks is enough time for detection and reporting if an event occurs.\n\nI would update higher with: evidence of high-risk human exposures, receptor binding studies showing human cell susceptibility, or suspected unconfirmed cases. I would update lower with: evidence of inability to infect human cells, confirmation of remote geographic isolation, or continued passage of time without incidents.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be any human cases of the novel coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Discovery of HKU5-CoV-2, a Novel Coronavirus in China](https://assure-test.com/discovery-of-hku5-cov-2-a-novel-coronavirus-in-china/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there are any human cases reported anywhere globally of HKU5-CoV-2.\n\nQuestion resolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), especially the World Health Organization or US Centers for Disease Control.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
