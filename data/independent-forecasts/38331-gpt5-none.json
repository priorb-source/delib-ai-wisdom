    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Between now and July 1, Wikipedia’s “Censorship of Twitter” page removes at least one of the seven countries from the “current” list—most plausibly Venezuela (if editors conclude access isn’t persistently blocked) or Russia (if credible reporting indicates unblocking/consistent accessibility). Any single removal yields a No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Wikipedia page remains unchanged in its “Current” section through end of June 2025, continuing to list China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela as currently blocking X/Twitter.",
    "rationale": "- Short horizon: With less than a month to go, the status quo typically persists. Wikipedia’s “current” lists change mainly when there’s clear, sourced policy shifts; absent that, pages tend to be stable.\n- Country-by-country outlook:\n  • China, Iran, North Korea, Turkmenistan: Longstanding, entrenched blocks; changes in the next few weeks are highly unlikely.\n  • Myanmar: Post-2021 coup restrictions have been sustained; no signals of imminent liberalization.\n  • Russia: Access was restricted since 2022. While partial/ISP-specific accessibility can fluctuate, there’s no strong indication of a formal nationwide unblocking imminent. Wikipedia has generally categorized Russia as blocking.\n  • Venezuela: The most fragile listing. Historically, blocks/restrictions have been intermittent and event-driven, though there have been repeated, documented restrictions via major ISPs. Whether Wikipedia maintains Venezuela under “currently” depends on editors’ synthesis of recent NetBlocks-style measurements and news. Given recent years’ pattern of recurrent restrictions, the listing may persist through end-June, but it’s the main downside risk.\n- Page dynamics risk: Even without real-world change, an editor could revise the “Current” list for consistency/precision (e.g., reclassifying Venezuela as intermittent). However, such changes typically require citations and consensus; within a few weeks, the probability of a definitive change across any of the seven is moderate but not high.\n- Why not higher: A single-country removal flips the outcome to No. Venezuela is the key vulnerability; Russia a secondary one. Also, Wikipedia edits can occur rapidly if new sources appear.\n- Why not lower: The window is short; most listed countries have very stable censorship regimes. Absent breaking news or a clear editorial push, the page is likely to remain as-is.\n- What would change my mind:\n  • Up: Multiple reliable reports confirming sustained, nationwide restrictions continuing in Venezuela and renewed confirmation of Russia’s ongoing block; low edit activity on the article through late June.\n  • Down: Credible reports of unblocking or consistent accessibility in Russia or Venezuela; Wikipedia talk-page consensus or recent edits removing or reclassifying any of the seven from “current.”\n- Research assistant: No additional information provided; forecast based on known country censorship patterns and typical Wikipedia editing behavior.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
