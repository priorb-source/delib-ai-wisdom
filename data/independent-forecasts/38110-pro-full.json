  "information": "The government of Benin closed its land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state around May 6-8, 2025. The specific crossing mentioned is between Taberu village in Baruten Local Government Area, Kwara State, and the neighboring Tanu village in Benin. On May 9, 2025, Benin extended its border security operations to the Sèmè and Owode borders in Lagos State. Stated reasons for the closure include concerns over arms smuggling, the emergence of a new militant group known as 'Mahmuda', and unregulated exportation of agricultural products like soya beans and cashews. Reports mentioned intelligence regarding the illegal importation of arms and ammunition from Parakou, Benin, into Nigeria.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, the Nigerian House of Representatives passed a resolution urging the Federal Government to engage in dialogue with the Republic of Benin to resolve the blockade. The motion highlighted the strain on bilateral relations and the disruption to seasonal trade critical to the livelihood of border communities. As of late May 2025, neither the Nigerian nor the Beninese government had issued any public statements suggesting an imminent reopening. On May 30, an AFRICOM briefing noted a deteriorating security threat environment along the Benin-Nigeria frontier.\n\nHistorical data on similar situations in West Africa show that border closures motivated by security concerns often persist for many months. For example, Nigeria's border closure with Benin in 2019-2020 lasted for about 16 months. Similarly, Benin's border with Niger, closed after the 2023 coup, remained shut many months later. A review of 15 security-related border closures in the ECOWAS region since 2015 indicates that approximately 20% were reopened within 60 days. Reopenings within two months are more common when the reasons are purely commercial or administrative, rather than related to terrorism or arms smuggling.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The border crossings are currently closed and, without a specific agreement to reopen them, they are likely to remain closed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Diplomatic talks between Nigeria and Benin fail to produce a swift resolution. The security concerns cited by Benin, including the threat from the 'Mahmuda' group and arms smuggling, are deemed too significant to be resolved within a month. The situation mirrors previous prolonged border closures in the region, and the crossings remain shut past the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Prompted by the Nigerian House of Representatives' resolution and economic pressure on border communities, high-level diplomatic engagement between the two countries occurs quickly. Nigeria provides credible security guarantees and commitments to joint patrols, sufficiently reassuring the Beninese government and leading to a rapid reopening of the border crossings.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the severity of the stated reasons for the closure and historical precedents for similar events in the region. The closure is explicitly linked to serious security concerns—a new terror group and arms smuggling—which are typically not resolved quickly. The AFRICOM briefing noting a deteriorating security environment reinforces this. Historical data provided is a strong anchor: Nigeria's own border closure in 2019 lasted 16 months, and a review of regional security-related closures shows only a 20% chance of reopening within 60 days. The resolution window here is even shorter, less than two months from the initial closure and only one month from today. While there is political pressure in Nigeria for a quick resolution, diplomatic processes and the implementation of new security arrangements take time. The current status is that the border is closed, and neither government has signaled an imminent breakthrough. The path to 'Yes' requires a rapid and successful diplomatic effort that overcomes significant security obstacles, which is unlikely in this short timeframe.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 15% because there is clear political and economic pressure for a resolution. The Nigerian legislature is involved, and the economic harm to border communities creates urgency that could accelerate talks. A swift, high-level agreement, while improbable, is not impossible.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 15% because the stated security threats are substantial and validated by external intelligence assessments. The historical base rate of 20% for reopening within 60 days serves as a ceiling, which I've adjusted downward due to the particularly short timeframe of this question (less than 60 days total) and the gravity of the cited reasons. I would increase my forecast upon credible reports of high-level presidential talks or the announcement of a joint security task force. I would decrease it if either government issues statements suggesting talks have stalled or if there are further security incidents in the region.",
