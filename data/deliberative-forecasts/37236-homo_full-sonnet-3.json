    "review": "Both forecasters converge around 30-32%, significantly more pessimistic than my 40%. Their key arguments: (1) The timing is more damaging than I weighted - tariffs on April 2nd affected 28 of 30 days, not just a portion of the month, (2) The 45% China booking collapse is a severe leading indicator that I may have underweighted, (3) The historical base rates may be less relevant given this represents a genuine structural break rather than normal economic variation. These are compelling points. However, I think they may be underweighting two factors: First, the measurement lag in export data is real - April exports reflect contracts and production timelines established earlier, providing some insulation from immediate tariff shocks. The booking data (forward-looking) doesn't necessarily translate one-to-one to April shipments (backward-looking). Second, services exports represent a large portion of total exports and face no direct tariff barriers, yet none of us has visibility into their resilience. The threshold requires not just slower growth but actual contraction - a 6% decline from February 2025's $278.5B to fall below $262.578B. While the leading indicators are severe, achieving an actual year-over-year decline contradicts the strong historical base rate and recent positive momentum evident through March.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating modestly downward to 35%. The other forecasters make valid points about timing - with tariffs implemented April 2nd, nearly the entire measurement period operated under the new regime, reducing the protective effect of lag I initially emphasized. The 45% booking decline and manufacturing PMI contraction are severe immediate signals. However, I remain less pessimistic than the 30-32% consensus because: (1) Export data inherently lags contract/production timelines, providing real though limited insulation, (2) Services exports likely remained more resilient and constitute a significant buffer, (3) Achieving a year-over-year decline requires overcoming both the strong historical base rate (79-93%) and the substantial February baseline cushion ($16B above threshold), (4) China is one market among many - export diversification may partially offset concentrated disruption. The forecast balances severe near-term disruption signals against structural factors suggesting some resilience.",
