    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that have caused me to update upward. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the honeymoon effect is well-supported - the specific details about Carney's early actions (tax cut, smaller cabinet, delaying budget) and the Trudeau 2015 precedent of >50% early approval provide strong evidence. Forecaster 2 raises an excellent technical point I missed: Morning Consult displays whole numbers, creating rounding/tie risk. If Carney leads by only 1-2 points in the underlying data, they could round to the same number, which resolves as No. This is a meaningful technical constraint. Both forecasters correctly note Trump's ceiling is typically 47-48%, and his approval has been remarkably stable in the low-to-mid 40s throughout his career. The short timeframe (6 weeks) does favor status quo trends. However, I find Forecaster 3's 85% slightly overconfident given: (1) the rounding/tie risk Forecaster 2 identified, (2) smaller Canadian samples creating more volatility, and (3) the inherent uncertainty in any 6-week forecast window. Forecaster 2's 70% appropriately weights these technical risks while still acknowledging the strong structural advantage Carney holds.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast upward from 68% to 73%. The key factors influencing this update are: (1) Stronger honeymoon effect evidence - Forecaster 3's details about Carney's smart early moves and historical precedents (Trudeau 2015) are compelling. New PMs typically sustain approval >50% for their first few months. (2) Trump's constrained ceiling - Both forecasters correctly note his approval rarely sustains above 47-48%, making it harder for him to catch up. (3) The short 6-week timeframe makes major trend reversals unlikely. However, I'm not going as high as 85% because: (1) Rounding/tie risk - Forecaster 2's point about whole-number display is crucial. A 1-2 point underlying advantage could round to a tie, resolving as No. (2) Sample volatility - Canada's smaller samples in Morning Consult tracking create more noise. (3) Unknown events - While unlikely in 6 weeks, scandals or rallying events could disrupt either leader's approval. My central scenario: Carney at 50-55%, Trump at 42-45%, giving Carney a clear edge but with non-trivial rounding and volatility risks preventing higher confidence.",
