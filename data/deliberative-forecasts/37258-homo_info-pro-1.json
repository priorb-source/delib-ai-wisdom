    "review": "Both other forecasters arrived at the same 5% probability, but they introduced several new and highly compelling arguments that I had not fully considered. Forecaster 2's point about the Scottish government's own stated priorities from April 2025—focusing on the economy and public services over an imminent referendum—is a strong piece of evidence about their current strategic posture. Forecaster 3 provided critical, short-term operational constraints: a by-election 'quiet period' from May 15 to June 5, which significantly shortens an already tight window, and the threat of major industrial action, which creates a domestic political environment where a constitutional announcement would be ill-timed. I find their reasoning extremely convincing as it adds specific, granular detail to the broader strategic reasons for inaction, making the case for a 'No' outcome even more robust.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of my fellow forecasters, I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. My initial reasoning was based on the significant legal hurdles from the UK Supreme Court ruling, the staunch political opposition from Westminster, and the internal priorities of a Scottish National Party undergoing a leadership transition. The other experts' contributions have strongly reinforced this conclusion by adding crucial short-term context that makes an announcement before July 1 not just strategically unwise, but logistically and politically impractical.\n\nThe by-election purdah period, as noted by Forecaster 3, effectively removes three weeks from the decision-making window, making an already improbable timeline nearly impossible. Furthermore, both forecasters correctly highlight that the current domestic focus is on core governance issues like public services and potential industrial action. An announcement of a referendum date would likely be perceived by the public as a major distraction, making it a politically damaging move for a new First Minister seeking to establish stability. The Scottish Government's own stated priorities from April, cited by Forecaster 2, confirm this inward focus. \n\nTherefore, the already low probability of a surprise announcement is further diminished by these operational and political realities. The path to a 'Yes' has narrowed significantly. I am not lowering my forecast below 5% because the resolution criteria still allow for a purely symbolic, non-binding announcement from a Scottish authority, which remains a low-probability tool in the political playbook to energize the base. However, the new evidence confirms that 5% is the correct assessment of this very small tail risk.",
