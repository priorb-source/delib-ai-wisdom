    "review": "All three forecasters agree that a 'Yes' outcome is highly unlikely due to the very short timeline before the July 1, 2025 deadline. My initial analysis focused on this procedural impossibility. Forecaster 2 reinforced this view by specifically highlighting the bureaucratic bottleneck of signature verification by Elections Alberta, a step that cannot even begin until a petition is submitted. Forecaster 3's analysis was the most influential for me, as it introduced a compelling political and strategic layer I had not fully articulated. They argued that the consistent lack of majority support for independence in polls, the significant economic risks, and the superior strategic value of using the *threat* of a referendum as a bargaining tool make it politically disadvantageous for the Premier to actually call one. This provides a strong rationale for *why* the government would not seek to expedite or bypass the standard process, even in a crisis.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 5% was based on the procedural infeasibility of holding a citizen-led referendum within the timeframe, while leaving room for a low-probability 'black swan' event where the government might act unilaterally. The deliberation has reinforced and deepened my conviction in a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 3's arguments are particularly persuasive in explaining why even the 'black swan' scenario is less likely than I first estimated. The lack of public support for separation makes calling a referendum an immense political gamble for Premier Smith, one she would likely lose, thereby weakening her position and the independence movement. The argument that the *threat* of a referendum is a more powerful political tool than the referendum itself is a crucial insight into the Premier's strategic calculus. These powerful political disincentives mean the threshold for the government to take such a drastic step is even higher than I had assumed. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast from 5% to 3% to reflect a reduced probability of the only plausible, albeit remote, path to a 'Yes' resolution.",
