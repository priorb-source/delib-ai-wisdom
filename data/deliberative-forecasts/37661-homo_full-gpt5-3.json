    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my view: licenses and political will are in place; the key gating item is BTRC tariff/pricing approval; and the remaining window is tight but feasible. The most useful added emphasis was on status quo inertia and that Starlink typically flips the map to “Available” only when orders are actually enabled (with local pricing visible). They also called out ancillary frictions (consumer protection filings, device type approval, customs/logistics). None of this is new hard evidence, but it slightly strengthens the case for delay risk within a 6–7 week window. I don’t see compelling new information about a local gateway requirement or policy shift, and the U.S. Senate inquiry still looks like headline risk more than an operational blocker. Overall, their reasoning is convincing on the timing risk, nudging me modestly downward.",
    "rationale": "Time left is about 6.5 weeks. Licenses are granted, a trial was completed, and the government has been publicly supportive with near-term launch talk. Technically, Starlink can activate via ISL without a local gateway. The primary blocker appears to be tariff/price plan approval and associated consumer-facing compliance so Starlink can publish pricing and open orders, which is when the map typically flips. Bangladesh has already allowed equipment import via the licensing, which reduces device/type-approval risk, but not necessarily tariff approval timing. Given typical administrative variability and the right-tail risk on post-license timelines, a slip into early July is plausible. Countering that, the political impetus and prior public targets suggest BTRC could clear tariffs in late May or June, enabling a June map flip. Netting these, I still see a modest edge to Yes but trim my estimate slightly to reflect the inertia and short fuse.",
