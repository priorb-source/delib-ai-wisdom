    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable additional context. Forecaster 2 raises important points I hadn't fully weighted: the NYSE non-compliance (though with 6-month cure period), stock trading at $0.51-$0.65 showing extreme market distress, and critically, Q1 earnings due May 12 which could reveal hidden problems. The argument that 'the situation could be worse than publicly known' is valid. However, their 8% forecast seems high given the timeframe. Forecaster 3 introduces crucial new information: strategic alternatives being actively explored (privatization/acquisition), litigation against Google (showing resources and fight rather than capitulation), and specific cost-cutting measures. These factors weren't in my original analysis and strongly support continued operations. Forecaster 3's reasoning on base rates and the distinction between long-term distress versus imminent collapse is compelling. All three of us converge on the extremely short timeframe being the dominant factor. The divergence is whether unknown risks and upcoming Q1 earnings justify higher probability.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating slightly upward from 3% to 4%. Forecaster 2's points about the upcoming Q1 earnings (May 12, just 7 days away) and the possibility of undisclosed problems are well-taken - this is a near-term catalyst I underweighted. The stock price of $0.51-$0.65 indicates extreme market distress beyond what I initially considered. However, Forecaster 3's new information about active strategic alternatives, Google litigation, and targeted cost-cutting measures actually strengthens the case against imminent bankruptcy - these indicate stakeholders see viable paths forward and management has resources to fight. The 57-day timeframe remains the dominant factor. Even if Q1 results are catastrophic, management would likely pursue emergency financing, accelerated strategic transactions, or other alternatives in the remaining 50 days before resorting to bankruptcy. NYSE non-compliance has a 6-month cure period, not 57 days. The base rate for public companies filing bankruptcy within such a compressed window, especially while actively pursuing strategic alternatives and litigation, remains extremely low. I'm moving to 4% to acknowledge legitimate concerns about unknown factors and Q1 earnings risk, but not to 8% because the evidence still strongly favors continued operations through July 1, 2025.",
