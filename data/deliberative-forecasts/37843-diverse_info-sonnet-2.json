    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most compelling new argument: the distinction between confidential and public S-1 filings. Under the JOBS Act, companies can file confidentially, meaning Discord could be further along than we know - but critically, only PUBLIC filings count for resolution. This helps explain the March-to-May gap without contradicting the reports. Forecaster 3's point about typical timing patterns is also strong: companies targeting fall IPOs often file public S-1s in late summer (July-August), which would miss our June 30 deadline. Forecaster 2's emphasis on source credibility and Discord's IPO ambition (Microsoft rejection) is valid but doesn't overcome the timing constraints. The specificity of bank mandates does indicate serious preparation, but mandates can exist months before public action. The key tension: real evidence of 2025 intent exists, but typical IPO mechanics suggest a late-June public filing is not the modal outcome for a fall listing. Both alternative resolution paths (public S-1 or website announcement) require proactive disclosure, and 38 days is a tight window when companies often optimize timing for market conditions.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters, I find Forecaster 3's analysis most rigorous on the specific resolution mechanics. The timing pattern argument is particularly persuasive: if Discord targets Q3/Q4 2025 IPO (consistent with '2025 IPO' reporting), they likely wouldn't need to publicly file until July-August, missing our deadline. The confidential filing possibility explains the current silence without invalidating March reports. Forecaster 2's 60% seems to underweight these timing dynamics and overweight the mere existence of preparation. However, I don't want to discount entirely the possibility of: (1) an accelerated timeline with late-June public filing, (2) a website announcement without S-1, or (3) market conditions prompting earlier-than-typical disclosure. The credible March reports with named banks do indicate real 2025 intent. But 'planning a 2025 IPO' doesn't necessarily mean 'announcing before July 1.' My original 40% adequately captured uncertainty, but the timing pattern argument shifts me slightly more bearish. I'm updating down to 38% to align with Forecaster 3's more disciplined analysis of resolution mechanics and typical IPO timelines.",
