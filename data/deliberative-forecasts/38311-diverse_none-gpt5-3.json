    "review": "Both forecasters rely on the strong base rate and the White House confirmation, which I agree are the dominant factors this close to the event. Forecaster 3 adds a useful explicit mention of weather/logistics/security as potential blockers for in‑person presence; that’s a small but real tail risk. Forecaster 2’s point that canceling now would be a major slight is true in general, though with Trump the “unpredictability” factor slightly weakens that deterrent. Neither adds decisive new evidence beyond what I’d already incorporated (confirmation, timing, Trump’s volatility), and both land in the high‑80s/90% range consistent with my prior view.",
    "rationale": "No material new information has emerged to shift the balance. The base rate for U.S. presidential G7 attendance plus an on‑record White House confirmation, so close to the summit, make attendance highly likely. A brief appearance satisfies the resolution. Residual risks keeping this below near‑certainty: last‑minute health issue, domestic/foreign crisis, idiosyncratic cancellation, weather/logistics/security disruption, or a date shift outside June (appears unlikely). Given these tails and Trump’s history of abrupt changes, I’m maintaining my forecast. I would move higher on formal schedule release with precise dates, observable pre‑positioning/departure, or pool reports of wheels‑down; lower on credible reports of health issues, an acute crisis, or any indication of delay beyond June.",
