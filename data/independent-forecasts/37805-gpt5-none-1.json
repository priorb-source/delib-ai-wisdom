    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Saipan likely has 4 or fewer scheduled nonstop destinations listed (Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Seoul-Incheon).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By July 1, FlightsFrom.com lists only Guam (United), the two inter-island routes to Rota and Tinian (Marianas Southern Airways), and one Korean route (most likely Incheon on Jeju Air). Busan and Japan routes remain suspended or operate only as ad-hoc charters not reflected in OAG/FlightsFrom.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In addition to Guam, Rota, Tinian, and Incheon, at least one more international route (e.g., Busan or Tokyo Narita) is scheduled and appears in OAG/FlightsFrom by July 1, possibly as a seasonal summer service by a Korean LCC or a Japanese carrier.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: There are roughly six weeks left. Airline schedules for early July are usually filed well in advance. Without an already-announced/additional route, the set of destinations tends to be sticky at this horizon.\n- Likely baseline: Recent years show SPN regularly linked to Guam (United) and the inter-island airports Rota and Tinian (Marianas Southern Airways), plus a core international service to Seoul-Incheon (Jeju Air). That yields about four destinations. The Travel and Tour World piece highlights ongoing challenges and suspensions, which makes expansion beyond this baseline less likely.\n- What could push it to 5+: Seasonal summer demand sometimes brings back Busan or a Japan route (e.g., Narita) as scheduled services. If a Korean LCC resumes PUS-SPN or a Japanese carrier runs scheduled (not purely charter) NRT-SPN and it’s filed in OAG, FlightsFrom would show it, pushing the count above four.\n- Why not higher: The article’s theme of struggling tourism and prior suspensions reduce odds of additional routes. China routes remain unlikely; Japan demand has been soft and subject to currency headwinds; Korean secondary-city routes have been volatile.\n- Why not lower: July is peak travel season in Northeast Asia; if any expansion happens, it would likely be then. Inter-island services and Guam are stable; Incheon service has been the main international lifeline and is likely to persist into summer.\n- What would change my view upward: Evidence on FlightsFrom or carrier announcements showing a scheduled Busan or Narita service in late June/early July; MVA or airline press releases confirming summer schedules in OAG/GDS.\n- What would move it downward: Evidence that Incheon is suspended during early July, or that inter-island services are not listed in OAG/FlightsFrom (e.g., if only charter-like operations remain), leaving just 1–3 destinations.\n- Research assistant provided no additional info; reasoning is based on typical recent route patterns and schedule dynamics for SPN and the region.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 4 direct flight destinations from Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Northern Marianas struggles to revive tourism amid flight suspensions and travel restrictions: What you need to know?](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/northern-marianas-struggles-to-revive-tourism-amid-flight-suspensions-and-travel-restrictions-what-you-need-to-know/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 4 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Saipan (SPN)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/SPN) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
