    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize administrative inertia versus the straightforward nature of a small, localized, expired-product recall. Forecaster 3 adds a useful base-rate claim that even small FSIS recalls can take 3–6 months to close, which I hadn’t explicitly incorporated. Both rightly highlight that status quo (Active after ~10 weeks) weighs toward No. I find their reasoning generally convincing, especially the point that process timelines and verification/documentation steps often don’t compress late in the window. I still think the small scope, vending-only distribution, and fully expired product keep a meaningful chance of late-May closure, but I accept that my earlier 2–4 month heuristic may be optimistic relative to a 3–6 month base rate. One extra consideration I’d add is the June 1 being a Sunday—if closures typically post on business days, that slightly tilts against a Yes by the deadline.",
    "rationale": "What’s needed for closure: FSIS must verify all affected product is out of commerce and corrective actions are in place. Given the small volume (303 lbs), limited WA vending distribution, and best-by dates in late February, physical removal likely occurred long ago. The residual risk is timeline slippage in documentation/verification and agency posting. We have ~24 days from May 8 to June 1; if closures commonly fall around a ~90-day mark, late May is plausible but tight. Being Active for ~73–74 days already signals either ongoing verification or an administrative queue, and June 1 falls on a Sunday, marginally reducing the chance the status flips in time for Metaculus’ check. I’m modestly updating down from 45% to 38% to reflect the 3–6 month closure base rate and weekend timing, while retaining nontrivial odds because the case is simple, localized, and illness-free. I’d move up on evidence that LPK1 has submitted and FSIS has accepted close-out documentation; I’d move down on any indication of delays, recall expansion, or broader FSIS backlog.",
