    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current CDC recommendation is 0.7 mg/L. If no change occurs, the recommendation will still be 0.7 mg/L on the resolution date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The HHS review, influenced by political pressure from fluoride critics, is fast-tracked. The review panel hastily recommends a lower level (e.g., 0.6 mg/L) or a suspension of the recommendation pending further study, and the CDC updates its guidance page to reflect this change before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The HHS review process does not conclude before the resolution date, or it concludes by reaffirming the existing scientific consensus. Consequently, the CDC's guidance page continues to recommend 0.7 mg/L on July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high degree of institutional and scientific inertia surrounding long-standing public health recommendations. The 0.7 mg/L level was established in 2015 after a thorough review, and changing it would require substantial new evidence and a lengthy formal process. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the extremely short timeline; a period of less than three months (from the review's announcement on April 10 to the resolution date of July 1) is insufficient for a federal agency to conduct a credible scientific review, undergo a public comment period, and implement a change to a major public health guideline. The status quo is a powerful force in government, and the default outcome is for existing recommendations to remain in place.\n\nThe research assistant's report of 'No additional information' is key, as it indicates there is no publicly known, paradigm-shifting scientific data that would compel a rapid change. The primary pressure for a change appears to be political, as hinted by the prompt's background information. While political pressure can be influential, it is unlikely to override decades of established scientific consensus and bureaucratic procedure within such a compressed timeframe.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 90% because the existence of a politically motivated, high-level HHS review introduces a non-trivial chance of a rapid, top-down directive to alter the recommendation. It is possible, though unlikely, that a decision has already been made to force a change for political reasons, bypassing the standard scientific process. My forecast is not lower because this scenario is highly improbable given the expected resistance from the scientific and public health communities and the procedural hurdles involved.\n\nI would lower my probability if there were official announcements of a fast-tracked timeline, leaks of a draft recommendation with a lower number, or the appointment of known fluoride skeptics to the review panel. I would raise it if HHS or the CDC released a statement clarifying that the review would be a long-term process and no changes would be implemented before the resolution date.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
