  "information": "In May 2025, news reports indicated that Sam Altman had made conciliatory gestures towards Elon Musk. Altman reportedly wrote to Musk proposing a collaboration on the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and extended an 'olive branch.' While Musk had not publicly responded to the written offer, reports mentioned that informal contacts had occurred between the technical teams of their respective organizations. Separately, Altman publicly posted on social media to Musk, stating, 'AGI is too important, can't let petty grudges get in the way.'",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~20 days until the event window opens (after 7:59 AM PDT on June 16, 2025) and ~22 days until it closes (by 12:00 AM PDT on June 18, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "They give separate keynotes or interviews on different sessions/days; security/logistics avoid joint appearances; one appears virtually; or one cancels/doesn’t show.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "YC schedules a joint fireside chat/panel, an opening or closing session featuring both, or a moderated dialogue where both are physically on the stage at the same time.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates and event design: At multi-headliner conferences, top speakers are usually given separate slots; joint appearances of two high-profile, somewhat adversarial figures are uncommon. That tilts the status quo toward No.\n- Relationship and incentives: Musk and Altman have had public tensions (including legal/PR disputes). The research assistant notes Altman’s May 2025 olive-branch outreach and public tone about collaboration. That increases the possibility of a symbolic joint stage moment, but it doesn’t guarantee Musk’s agreement.\n- Attendance reliability: Altman’s attendance is very likely (YC ties, SF location). Musk’s attendance at conferences is less reliable, and any no-show or virtual shift would resolve No under the criteria. Even if both attend, a joint session must be explicitly arranged.\n- PR calculus: A joint appearance would be a major media moment with upside for YC and potentially for both speakers if they want to signal detente. Conversely, it’s risky and could overshadow the event or create awkwardness, so organizers may prefer separate segments.\n- Net assessment: Combining (a) non-trivial chance of Musk not appearing in person; (b) standard conference programming patterns favoring separate headliners; with (c) a modest bump from recent conciliatory signals yields a low-to-moderate probability.\n- Why not higher: No confirmed joint session on the public record (as of May 27), lingering tensions, and cancellation/format risks.\n- Why not lower: Both are announced headliners at the same place/time window, the PR upside of a reconciliation moment, and Altman’s recent outreach.\n- What would move this up: A published agenda listing a joint session; credible reporting of a planned joint interview/panel; Musk publicly acknowledging or accepting Altman’s outreach; confirmation that both will be physically present in SF for both days.\n- What would move this down: Either speaker’s schedule indicating separate solo talks with no joint plenary; reports of renewed conflict; signs Musk will appear remotely or skip; any agenda update showing no multi-speaker plenaries/opening/closing featuring both.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn May 2025, news reports indicated that Sam Altman had made conciliatory gestures towards Elon Musk. Altman reportedly wrote to Musk proposing a collaboration on the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and extended an 'olive branch.' While Musk had not publicly responded to the written offer, reports mentioned that informal contacts had occurred between the technical teams of their respective organizations. Separately, Altman publicly posted on social media to Musk, stating, 'AGI is too important, can't let petty grudges get in the way.'\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
