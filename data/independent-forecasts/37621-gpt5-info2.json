  "information": "Multiple reports indicate that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell favors the ban. Goodell has stated that the play 'feels more like rugby' than football and that returning to pre-2005 rules that banned pushing players 'makes a lot of sense.' The NFL league office also reportedly wants to eliminate the play. Additionally, the NFL's Competition Committee and health and safety officials, including Dr. Allen Sills, have expressed concerns about the play's potential for injury.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 20 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Owners do not take up the proposal at the May Spring League Meeting, or they discuss it but it fails to get 24 votes. No official announcement restricting the play is made before June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At the Spring League Meeting in late May, owners approve a rule change (e.g., reinstating the pre-2005 ban on assisting the runner by pushing, or any specific restriction targeted at the Tush-Push). The NFL then officially announces the change before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Timing and process: Most on-field rule changes are typically passed at the Annual Meeting (March). As of today there’s been no approval, implying it did not clear in March 2025. That leaves a single practical window: the Spring League Meeting in late May. Passing a rules change there does happen, but it’s less common than in March and still requires 24/32 votes. With roughly 20 days left, the window is narrow.\n- Institutional stance: The research assistant indicates the Commissioner, league office, health/safety officials (Dr. Sills), and the Competition Committee have voiced concerns and/or favor eliminating the play. That increases the chance of action; when the league office and Competition Committee are aligned, proposals often succeed. Also, the question resolves Yes for any restriction on the play (not necessarily a total ban), which provides multiple pathways to a Yes.\n- Countervailing forces and inertia: Owners and coaches have previously resisted a ban, and the play was tabled rather than banned in 2024. The league historically moves cautiously on on-field tactics without clear safety data or competitive equity issues. If injury data are mixed or the play’s prominence/efficacy declined in 2024, the incentive to act now may be weaker. Given the high bar (24 votes) and that a change didn’t pass in March, status quo inertia looms large.\n- Why not higher: If a ban had overwhelming support, it likely would have passed in March. On-field rule changes outside the Annual Meeting are less frequent; we may also see preference to defer to the 2026 cycle rather than rush pre-camp.\n- Why not lower: There are credible signals of top-down support (Goodell, league office, Competition Committee), and multiple forms of restriction would qualify as a Yes. The Spring Meeting could still deliver a vote, and leaks have suggested stronger support relative to prior years.\n- What would move the forecast up: Reporting that a restriction is formally on the Spring Meeting agenda, credible leaks of a near-consensus among owners (e.g., 24+ likely votes), or public statements from influential owners/Competition Committee members signaling an agreed framework.\n- What would move it down: Reports that the issue is off the Spring agenda or is being deferred to 2026, credible pushback from key owners/union/competition committee members, or reporting that a vote will be withdrawn or lacks sufficient support.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the NFL ban the \"Tush-Push\" before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nESPN: [Vote on tush push ban tabled by NFL owners for more discussion](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44490292/sources-tush-push-ban-vote-tabled-nfl-owners) | CBS Sports: [Expansive 'Tush Push' ban could have strong support at NFL's next owners meeting, per report](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/expansive-tush-push-ban-could-have-strong-support-at-nfls-next-owners-meeting-per-report/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Football League officially approves or announces a rule restricting the quarterback sneak known as the [Tush-Push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sneak#Tush_push) before June 1, 2025. If there are no reports of this occurring before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMultiple reports indicate that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell favors the ban. Goodell has stated that the play 'feels more like rugby' than football and that returning to pre-2005 rules that banned pushing players 'makes a lot of sense.'

Additionally, the NFL's Competition Committee and health and safety officials, including Dr. Allen Sills, have expressed concerns about the play's potential for injury.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
