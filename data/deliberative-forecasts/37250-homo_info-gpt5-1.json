    "review": "Both added crucial constraints I underweighted. Forecaster 2 surfaced explicit presidential resistance and DHS posture (immediate re-deportation if he arrived), which materially lowers executive-branch willingness to comply swiftly even under court pressure. Forecaster 3 introduced the strongest new factor: that Garcia is reportedly in a Salvadoran maximum-security prison and that President Bukele has publicly labeled him a terrorist and refuses release—making El Salvador, not just DHS, a hard blocker on a <60‑day horizon. Together, these make a court-driven outcome far less tractable and reduce the plausibility of quick logistics I previously assumed. Their trigger conditions for moving up/down are sensible; I find Forecaster 3’s sovereign-custody argument particularly persuasive.",
    "rationale": "My prior 40% rested on courts’ leverage and practical feasibility if the U.S. executive cooperated, and on the assumption El Salvador would not be the principal blocker. The added information that (1) the U.S. executive is openly resistant and missed a return deadline, and (2) Garcia is detained in El Salvador with Bukele refusing release, sharply reduces near-term paths to Yes. U.S. courts can press DHS but cannot compel a foreign sovereign to release and transfer him; the administration can plausibly avoid contempt by documenting unsuccessful diplomatic efforts. With ~61 days left, the remaining Yes paths are narrow: a sudden bilateral deal or Salvadoran decision to expel him to the U.S., or a coercive court action that coincides with unexpected Salvadoran cooperation. Independent illicit re-entry is near-zero given custody and profile. Net result: substantial downward revision reflecting dual-executive resistance (U.S. and Salvadoran) and time pressure. I lower from 40% to 6%.",
