  "information": "GoPro's financial results for 2024 showed a full-year revenue of $801 million, a 20% decline year-over-year, with a net loss of $432 million, or $2.82 per share. As of December 31, 2024, the company held $283 million in cash reserves against $131 million in debt. The company's current ratio was reported at 0.5, and its market capitalization was approximately $90.68 million as of May 1, 2025, with a stock price of $0.58.\n\nFor its upcoming first quarter 2025 earnings report, scheduled for May 12, 2025, analysts expect GoPro to report a quarterly loss of approximately $0.13 per share on revenues of around $124.9 million, which would represent a year-over-year revenue decline of about 19.6%. The company itself has stated it expects unit sales and revenue in 2025 to be lower than in 2024, citing macroeconomic headwinds and competition. In response, the company has initiated plans to reduce operating expenses by nearly 30% during 2025.\n\nIn early 2025, GoPro announced it was named the official camera of the 2025 Freeride World Tour for the 12th consecutive year. The company also released a minor upgrade to its GoPro Max panoramic camera in February 2025. Reports in May 2025 also noted the release of a new GoPro Hero13 camera featuring an anamorphic lens. The company's most significant debt maturity is a convertible note due in November 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 53 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "GoPro continues operating with declining revenues and significant losses but avoids bankruptcy filing through July 1, 2025 by managing its existing cash reserves and implementing planned cost reductions",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GoPro navigates the next two months by carefully managing its $283 million in cash reserves, successfully implementing its planned 30% operating expense reduction, and either securing additional financing or finding strategic alternatives. The company meets all near-term obligations and avoids any covenant breaches or liquidity crises through July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GoPro experiences an unexpected rapid cash burn, faces a covenant breach on existing obligations, loses a major customer or partner, or encounters an unforeseen liability that depletes cash reserves faster than anticipated. Unable to secure emergency financing and facing immediate obligations it cannot meet, the company files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The key financial indicators present a mixed picture. On the positive side, GoPro has $283 million in cash against only $131 million in debt, providing a net cash position of $152 million. The major debt maturity (convertible note) is not until November 2025, which falls after the July 1 deadline. The company is actively taking restructuring actions with planned 30% operating expense reductions and continues to release products and maintain partnerships. With only 53 days remaining until the deadline, this short timeframe works against a bankruptcy scenario materializing. However, several concerning factors exist: the current ratio of 0.5 indicates current liabilities are double current assets, suggesting liquidity stress; the company reported a massive $432 million net loss in 2024; revenues are declining 20% year-over-year with further declines expected in 2025; and the market capitalization of only $90 million despite $283 million in cash suggests the market perceives significant risk of value destruction. The probability is not lower (2-3%) because the current ratio and ongoing losses indicate genuine financial distress that could theoretically trigger bankruptcy if hidden liabilities emerge or cash burns faster than expected. The probability is not higher (20-30%) because the company has sufficient cash to likely survive the next two months, no major debt maturities before July 1, and bankruptcy typically shows warning signs that we're not currently seeing. Good forecasting practice suggests heavy weight on the status quo—companies don't typically go from operating to bankruptcy filing within 53 days unless facing an acute crisis. I would update higher if we saw reports of supplier non-payment, mass employee departures, covenant breach notices, or failed financing attempts. I would update lower with successful cost reduction implementation, stabilizing revenues, or securing new financing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill GoPro file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and 2024 Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000150043525000003/gpro2024-12x31exh991xer.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nGoPro's financial results for 2024 showed a full-year revenue of $801 million, a 20% decline year-over-year, with a net loss of $432 million, or $2.82 per share.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
