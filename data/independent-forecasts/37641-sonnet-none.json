    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Circle remains privately held",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Circle faces regulatory delays in SEC approval, encounters unfavorable market conditions, decides to postpone the IPO timing, or simply cannot complete the complex IPO process within the remaining 47 days",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Circle accelerates its IPO timeline, receives rapid SEC approval, successfully completes its roadshow and pricing process, and begins trading on NYSE in mid-to-late June 2025",
    "rationale": "The Forbes article from April 4, 2025 provides a strong positive signal that Circle has serious IPO momentum, with the headline explicitly discussing 'The Circle IPO' as if it's a concrete plan rather than speculation. However, several factors temper optimism: First, only 47 days remain until the deadline, which is an extremely tight window for completing an IPO process that typically involves SEC review, roadshows, pricing negotiations, and final approvals. Second, the research assistant provides no additional information about concrete progress markers like SEC filing status, pricing announcements, or trading date confirmations. Third, crypto and stablecoin companies face heightened regulatory scrutiny, which can introduce unexpected delays. The status quo heavily favors 'No' simply because the world changes slowly - most announced IPOs face delays, and rushing a major financial event in under two months from an April article is ambitious. My forecast is not higher because we lack confirmation of specific milestones being met (S-1 effectiveness, pricing date, etc.). It's not lower because the Forbes article does suggest real movement rather than mere speculation, and some companies do execute rapid IPOs when conditions align. I would update higher with news of SEC approval, a confirmed pricing date, or an announced trading date. I would update lower if we reach mid-June without such announcements or if market/regulatory obstacles emerge.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Circle be publicly-traded before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nForbes: [The Circle IPO Solidifies 2025 As The Year Of Stablecoins](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/04/04/the-circle-ipo-solidifies-2025-as-the-year-of-stablecoin/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if shares of Circle Internet Group, Inc. are publicly traded on New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
