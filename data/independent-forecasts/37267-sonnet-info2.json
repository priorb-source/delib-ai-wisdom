  "information": "The US State Department advisory system has four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). As of early May 2025, 21 countries were under a Level 4 advisory for reasons including terrorism, civil unrest, war, and health emergencies. Historically, out of the 25–35 countries typically at Level 3, only 2–4 are upgraded to Level 4 in a given year. Upgrades from Level 3 to Level 4 often follow clear catalysts such as coups, invasions, airport closures, hostage incidents involving foreigners, or the ordered departure of non-essential U.S. embassy staff.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (60 days) from May 2, 2025 until the July 1, 2025 resolution date",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ethiopia maintains its current travel advisory level (likely Level 3 or below) and does not receive a Level 4 advisory before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ethiopia's security situation remains relatively stable through June 2025. While regional conflicts may persist, no major incidents occur involving U.S. citizens or embassy operations. The State Department determines that the current advisory level remains appropriate, with no dramatic escalation requiring an immediate upgrade to Level 4. Tourist areas like Addis Ababa remain accessible without triggering the specific crisis thresholds needed for a Level 4 designation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major security incident occurs in Ethiopia between now and July 1st that crosses the threshold for Level 4. This could include: a coup or dramatic escalation of civil conflict threatening the capital, a terrorist attack on Western targets, kidnapping of American citizens, closure of Addis Ababa airport, rebel forces advancing on government-controlled areas in ways that endanger foreigners, or the State Department ordering departure of non-essential embassy personnel due to imminent threats.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors a No outcome. According to the research assistant, only 2-4 countries out of 25-35 at Level 3 are upgraded to Level 4 annually - roughly 6-13% per year, or approximately 1-2% over a 2-month period for any given Level 3 country. Upgrades require specific crisis catalysts like coups, invasions, airport closures, or ordered embassy departures - not gradual deterioration.\n\nEthiopia likely has elevated risk compared to the average Level 3 country. The reference to 'new travel warnings in 2025' suggests recent deterioration, and Ethiopia has ongoing conflicts despite the 2022 Tigray peace agreement. However, the question mentions tourism to Addis Ababa continuing, and there's no indication of imminent crisis, embassy evacuation plans, or specific recent escalatory events.\n\nThe status quo principle is crucial here: the world changes slowly most of the time, and Level 4 upgrades are rare, discretionary decisions requiring clear justification. With only 60 days remaining, the window is quite narrow for such a dramatic policy change.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: (1) no current evidence suggests an imminent crisis requiring Level 4; (2) the base rate for upgrades is very low; (3) the State Department is conservative about Level 4 designations given their severity; (4) two months is a short timeframe for the necessary conditions to develop.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: (1) Ethiopia does have active security concerns and conflicts; (2) regional instability from Sudan and Somalia could spill over; (3) the reference to new warnings suggests deteriorating conditions; (4) while unlikely, crisis events can develop quickly; (5) Ethiopia appears to be among the higher-risk countries at Level 3.\n\nTo update higher, I would need: credible reports of major conflict escalation, threats to U.S. embassy operations, hostage situations involving Americans, or announcements of authorized or ordered departure of embassy staff. To update lower, I would need: evidence of peace agreements, significant de-escalation, or confirmation that Ethiopia is currently at Level 1 or 2 (not Level 3).",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
