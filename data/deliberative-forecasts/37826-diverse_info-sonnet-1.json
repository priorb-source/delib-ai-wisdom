    "review": "Forecaster 2 introduces critical information I initially missed: the May 10 ceasefire and troop withdrawal agreement. This fundamentally changes the baseline from 'tense status quo' to 'active de-escalation,' which significantly reduces the probability of kinetic action. Forecaster 3 correctly identifies that Operation Sindoor already occurred with strikes in Pakistan proper, meaning India has already acted (potentially satisfying domestic demands) and also provides the Eid al-Adha timing consideration. However, Forecaster 3's 33% seems insufficiently weighted toward the ceasefire's constraining effect.\n\nThe key tension is between two dynamics: (1) the active ceasefire and mutual withdrawal indicating strong de-escalation momentum, versus (2) the explicit 'full authority' granted to Western Commanders for retaliation to violations. Forecaster 2's 10% may underweight the conditional trigger probability over 30 days, while Forecaster 3's 33% appears to insufficiently account for the ceasefire changing the default trajectory from escalation to de-escalation.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the May 10 ceasefire and troop withdrawal agreement are decisive new information that significantly alters my initial assessment. My 20% forecast was implicitly based on a tense-but-uncertain status quo. The reality is we're in an active de-escalation phase, not a pre-escalation or plateau phase.\n\nHowever, I don't fully agree with Forecaster 2's 10% for these reasons: (1) The explicit grant of retaliatory authority creates a conditional hair-trigger - if Pakistan commits clear violations, Indian commanders can act immediately without seeking approval. (2) Ceasefires between India and Pakistan are historically fragile. (3) We have a 30-day window, not a few days. (4) Operation Sindoor demonstrates recent willingness to strike in Pakistan proper, establishing precedent.\n\nYet Forecaster 3's 33% overweights these factors relative to the ceasefire's constraining power. The troop withdrawal agreement indicates both sides want de-escalation. Nuclear deterrence remains paramount. The diplomatic offensive through June 5 suggests India wants to exhaust non-military options.\n\nThe realistic path to 'Yes' now requires: (1) A significant Pakistani ceasefire violation or (2) A major terrorist attack traced to Pakistan. Without a triggering event, unilateral Indian action becomes extremely unlikely given the ceasefire.\n\nI'm revising down from 20% to 14%, acknowledging the ceasefire's powerful de-escalatory effect while maintaining that the conditional retaliatory framework and 30-day window create non-trivial risk if provocations occur.",
