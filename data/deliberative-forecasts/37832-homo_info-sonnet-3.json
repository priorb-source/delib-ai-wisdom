    "review": "Forecaster 2 provided crucial new information I missed: Databricks raised $15.25B in January 2025 (just 4 months ago) at a $62B valuation, with funds allocated for employee liquidity and strategic investor Meta participating. This is devastating to the YES case - companies simply don't raise massive funding rounds and then announce IPOs months later. It removes capital pressure, addresses employee liquidity, and signals comfort staying private. This strongly reinforces the NO outcome.\n\nForecaster 3 identifies an interesting catalyst - the Data + AI Summit (June 9-12) - but I believe they're significantly overweighting it. Product/technology conferences are not typical venues for IPO announcements, which are financial/regulatory events usually handled through SEC filings or financial press releases. More importantly, Forecaster 3 seems to underweight the significance of the January funding round. Why would a company raise $15B and then announce an IPO 5 months later? The logic doesn't hold.\n\nForecaster 3's 22% forecast appears to rest heavily on the summit as a 'natural focal point,' but this reasoning is weak given: (1) IPO announcements rarely occur at technical conferences, (2) the January funding dramatically reduces IPO motivation, (3) no preparation signals exist, and (4) the CEO's explicit statements against 2025 IPO remain uncontradicted.",
    "rationale": "The January 2025 funding round is the most significant piece of information in this entire analysis. A $15.25B raise at $62B valuation, including employee liquidity provisions and strategic investors like Meta, fundamentally changes the calculus. This removes virtually all near-term IPO pressure:\n\n- Capital runway extended by 1-2+ years minimum\n- Employee liquidity addressed (key IPO driver eliminated)\n- Demonstrates strong private market appetite\n- Signals management comfort with private ownership\n- Occurred AFTER CEO's 'dumb to IPO this year' comments\n\nThe confluence of factors now pointing to NO is overwhelming: recent mega-funding, explicit CEO statements, zero preparation signals, employee needs met, 40-day window, and no credible reports. The Data + AI Summit is a weak counter-signal - technical conferences aren't IPO announcement venues, and the timing doesn't align with typical IPO processes.\n\nThe resolution criteria only require an announcement of PLANNING an IPO, not actual filing. However, even this lower bar seems nearly impossible given the January funding and current absence of any signals. I'm updating DOWN from my initial 3% because the funding round information strengthens the NO case significantly. Only catastrophic unforeseen circumstances or dramatic strategic shifts could produce a YES outcome now.",
