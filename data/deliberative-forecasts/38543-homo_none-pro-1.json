    "review": "The other two forecasters' analyses are in very strong agreement with my own. We have all independently identified the same decisive factor: the extremely short timeframe of approximately two weeks until the resolution date. Both forecasters correctly argue that the logistical, security, and diplomatic preparations required for a US presidential visit to China are extensive and cannot realistically be completed in such a short period from a standing start. We all converge on a baseline assumption that the status quo (no visit planned) will hold, while allowing for a minimal, ~1% probability to account for a 'black swan' event or an unprecedented diplomatic emergency, which aligns with Donald Trump's reputation for unconventional approaches. No new evidence was presented that I hadn't considered; rather, the other analyses served to strongly reinforce the consensus view.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 1%. The deliberation with the other forecasters has confirmed my initial reasoning. The core of the argument remains unchanged: with only 15 days until July 1, 2025, the practical barriers to organizing and executing a presidential visit to China are immense. Such visits typically require months of planning by numerous agencies. The complete absence of any public chatter, media reporting, or official groundwork strongly indicates that no such visit is being contemplated. The consensus among all three forecasters on this point is compelling. While I acknowledge the possibility of a highly improbable emergency summit, which is what the 1% forecast accounts for, no evidence has emerged to suggest such a scenario is unfolding. Therefore, the overwhelmingly likely outcome is 'No'.",
