  "information": "On March 13, 2025, the government of Chad officially granted Starlink an operating license. The stated goal is to enhance internet connectivity, particularly in remote areas where the existing 6,000 km of fiber optic infrastructure is insufficient, and to support educational and healthcare institutions. Government officials have stated that negotiations were conducted to ensure affordable pricing for the service.\n\nThe time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming 'Available' on its map varies in other African nations. For the Democratic Republic of Congo, the process took approximately 10 weeks in 2025. For Malawi and Zambia, it was about 16 weeks, and for Benin, it was 24 weeks. Niger's service was officially launched on March 13, 2025, the same day Chad's license was announced. In May 2025, a pan-African partnership between SpaceX and Airtel was announced to potentially accelerate kit distribution.\n\nStarlink's expansion faces both technical advantages and logistical challenges. The use of optical inter-satellite links reduces the need for local ground stations in every country. However, high demand has led to service pauses and waiting lists in other regions, including some African countries like Nigeria and Kenya. For Chad specifically, potential obstacles include its landlocked geography, limited retail infrastructure, and the need to finalize details such as import rules and spectrum fees.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Chad remains listed as Coming Soon / not Available on the Starlink map by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Post-license operational steps (import/customs rules for terminals, spectrum fee details, local payment rails, and retail/distribution setup) slip into July or later; Starlink prioritizes other markets’ launches; Chad’s page stays Coming Soon until Q3.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink finalizes distribution and regulatory/Customs details in June, leverages the new Airtel partnership, and flips at least part of Chad (e.g., N’Djamena area) to Available on the map, even if kit supply is initially constrained.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: Chad’s operating license was officially granted on 2025-03-13. July 1 falls ~15 weeks after licensing. As of today (2025-05-15), there are ~6.5 weeks left.\n- Base rates from nearby cases (per the research assistant): DRC ≈10 weeks from license to Available (fast), Malawi/Zambia ≈16 weeks (moderate), Benin ≈24 weeks (slow). Niger launched the same day its license was announced (immediate). The small sample suggests a wide range with a median around 16 weeks. Our cutoff (15 weeks) is just before that median, which slightly favors a miss.\n- Frictions specific to Chad: landlocked logistics, limited retail footprint, and potential lag in finalizing import rules and fee structures could delay opening orders. Starlink often waits to flip the map to Available until ordering/shipping and payment rails are genuinely ready.\n- Offsetting factors: Starlink’s laser links reduce dependence on local ground stations; Airtel’s pan-African partnership (announced May 2025) could accelerate kit distribution and last-mile logistics; Starlink has been moving quickly in Africa and may target additional Q2 activations for commercial momentum.\n- Weighing status quo: Given the historic median (~16 weeks) and the remaining 6.5 weeks, a slight lean to No is warranted. However, recent fast launches (Niger same-day, DRC ~10 weeks) and the Airtel partnership keep a meaningful chance of a June flip.\n- Why not higher: The typical lag centers near or just beyond our cutoff; Chad’s logistical and administrative steps may not complete in time.\n- Why not lower: There are credible fast-path precedents; regional operations nearby and Q2 incentives could bring a June activation.\n- What would move the forecast up: Concrete signs of readiness (Chad-specific pricing, local distributor announcements, customs/import guidance published, Starlink order page accepting Chad addresses, map hinting at June availability, government press notes confirming launch window).\n- What would move it down: Reports of regulatory or customs holdups, lack of local payment arrangements, or ongoing prioritization of other markets; no visible signals by early/mid-June that ordering will open in time.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
