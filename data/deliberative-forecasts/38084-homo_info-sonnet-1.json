    "review": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, I notice several important points. Forecaster 2 provides valuable additional context that I lacked - specifically that NOAA's Climate Prediction Center forecasts drought persistence through August 2025, and mentions extreme heat watches already issued. This strongly reinforces the Yes scenario. Forecaster 3 mentions potential storm systems (Tropical Storm Alvin and a Canadian low-pressure system) that could bring rainfall, which introduces some downside risk I hadn't fully considered.\n\nHowever, both forecasters note a critical limitation in their analyses: they lack precise current drought population figures. Forecaster 2 explicitly states 'the main uncertainty is the exact current population living in drought areas' and Forecaster 3 similarly notes 'I lack precise current drought population figures.' This is actually the most crucial piece of information for this forecast.\n\nMy research assistant provided the key data point: 22.7 million California residents were in drought areas as of May 27, 2025. This is not an estimate or projection - it's the actual current figure from the resolution source, just 30 days before the resolution date. We're already 2.7 million above the 20 million threshold.\n\nRegarding Forecaster 3's storm concerns: while isolated rainfall events can occur, the Drought Monitor classification system is based on multiple long-term indicators including soil moisture, streamflow, reservoir levels, and precipitation deficits. These don't shift dramatically from one or two storm systems. To move 2.7 million residents' worth of area out of drought classification would require sustained, widespread precipitation - highly unusual for June in California's dry season.\n\nForecaster 2's lower confidence (78%) and Forecaster 3's much lower confidence (65%) appear to stem primarily from their lack of current data, not from fundamentally different reasoning about drought dynamics or seasonal patterns.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my original 87% forecast appropriately balances the evidence:\n\n**Strong factors supporting Yes:**\n1. We're currently at 22.7 million (13.5% above threshold) - confirmed from the resolution source\n2. Only 30 days until resolution with 4-5 weekly updates remaining\n3. NOAA forecasts drought persistence through August (new information from Forecaster 2)\n4. Late June is peak dry season in California\n5. Drought conditions evolve slowly and require sustained precipitation to improve\n6. Heat watches already issued for late May\n\n**Moderate uncertainty factors:**\n1. Possibility of unexpected June rainfall (mentioned by Forecaster 3)\n2. Weather is inherently somewhat unpredictable over 30 days\n3. Drought Monitor uses complex classification criteria that could theoretically shift\n\n**Why not higher (90-95%)?** There's always some irreducible uncertainty in 30-day weather patterns, and unusual June precipitation, while unlikely, is not impossible.\n\n**Why not lower (65-80%)?** The current 2.7 million person buffer is substantial, the timeframe is very short, seasonal patterns strongly favor persistence, and authoritative forecasts predict continued drought through summer.\n\nThe new NOAA information from Forecaster 2 slightly strengthens the Yes case, while Forecaster 3's storm mention adds minimal downside risk. These roughly offset, and my original 87% forecast remains well-calibrated given the evidence.",
