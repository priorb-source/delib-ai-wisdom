    "review": "Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the short fuse, lack of visible preparatory signals, and the tendency for leaks aligns with my base-case logic; I agree the default favors No. I’d caution that absence of leaks isn’t dispositive given confidential filings and disciplined comms, but it still lowers odds. Forecaster 3 introduces a new and material claim: a very large January 2025 raise ($10B equity + $5.25B debt) with employee liquidity. If accurate, that substantially reduces urgency to announce an IPO now and is the most compelling downward pressure. I do think they overextend the CEO’s 2024 “dumb to IPO this year” remark to 2025; that statement was about 2024, not necessarily 2025. Still, the runway/liquidity point is strong. Overall, their arguments pull me down from my prior 22%, though not as low as 3–10% because a June announcement of a confidential submission or a public S-1 to target a fall window remains a live (if modest) path, and the firm is clearly IPO-ready in a hot AI market.",
    "rationale": "Key updates versus my prior view: (1) If the January 2025 mega-round with embedded employee liquidity is correct, it materially decreases near-term pressure to announce. That was not in my prior reasoning and meaningfully lowers the odds. (2) The June 9–12 Summit likely disincentivizes a pre-summit filing and complicates comms during/after, leaving only ~2.5 weeks post-summit before July 1. (3) We’ve seen no credible indications of a near-term filing or company-site announcement cadence. Balanced against this: Databricks is structurally IPO-ready, AI sentiment is strong, and some issuers do announce confidential S-1 submissions months ahead of pricing. A late-June “we have confidentially submitted” post on their news page or a public S-1 aimed at a fall pricing remains plausible but not probable. Net effect: I move down materially from 22% to reflect lower urgency and the short runway, but I keep a non-trivial tail for a June announcement aligned with a Q3/Q4 IPO window.",
