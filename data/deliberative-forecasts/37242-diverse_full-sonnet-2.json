    "review": "Both forecasters made nearly identical arguments to mine and reached 15%, slightly lower than my 18%. Their key insights include: (1) Forecaster 3 provided a concrete estimate that the power outage likely affected 5,000-15,000 passengers over 1-2 days, which is only 0.25-0.75% of the ~2 million monthly total; (2) Forecaster 2 emphasized that the disruption occurred in just the last 3 days of a 30-day month (10% of the period), making it unlikely to reverse 27 days of growth momentum; (3) Both explicitly noted that the Easter shift and capacity increases would 'plausibly add far more' than the outage would subtract. These are the same factors I identified, but their quantification helps clarify the relative magnitudes. The convergence at 15% from two independent analyses is noteworthy.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I find the other forecasters' reasoning compelling and their slight increase in confidence toward a No outcome (continued growth) is warranted. My original 18% may have overweighted tail risks from the power outage. The key insight is scale: even if the April 28-30 disruption affected 10,000-15,000 passengers (roughly 0.5-0.75% of monthly traffic), the structural positive factors are much larger. The Easter calendar shift alone typically produces a 3-5% boost when Easter moves from late March to mid-April. Combined with documented capacity increases of 7-10% from multiple airlines and the established Q1 growth momentum of 3.6%, the positive factors outweigh the negative by a significant margin. The outage represents a genuine but bounded risk - it was a one-day event with potential 2-3 day knock-on effects, affecting perhaps 5-6% of flights on those specific days. This creates some uncertainty but doesn't fundamentally change the probability landscape. I'm updating my forecast down from 18% to 16%, acknowledging the power outage risk remains meaningful but is unlikely to overcome the cumulative effect of Easter timing, capacity growth, and established momentum.",
