    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In an attempt to seize the narrative and demonstrate strength, Casey DeSantis's campaign decides that an early announcement is the best strategy. She formally launches her campaign in late June 2025 with a major media event.",
    "rationale": "The primary factor driving this forecast is the recent polling information from May 2025. The poll indicates that Byron Donalds, with the endorsement of Donald Trump, has surged ahead of Casey DeSantis. In a Florida Republican primary, a Trump endorsement is a formidable, if not decisive, factor. Launching a campaign from a position of weakness, as the polling suggests she would be, is strategically disadvantageous. The status quo is that she has not announced, and with less than a month until the deadline, inertia favors this continuing. It is more likely that her team will take time to re-evaluate their strategy, conduct internal polling, and wait for a more opportune moment rather than rush into an announcement in the face of such a significant political headwind. My forecast is not lower than 10% because campaign strategies can be counter-intuitive, and a surprise announcement to reset the narrative is not impossible. Her high name recognition means she could launch a campaign with less lead time than a typical candidate. My forecast is not higher because the political reality presented by the polling and the Trump endorsement makes an immediate declaration a high-risk, low-reward proposition. I would increase the probability if credible reports emerge of an imminent announcement or if Donald Trump were to suggest his endorsement is not finalized. I would decrease the probability if other major Florida Republicans endorse Byron Donalds, further consolidating his position.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Casey DeSantis announce her candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Poll: Trump's endorsement boosts Byron Donalds over Casey DeSantis for Florida governor](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/05/09/poll-byron-donalds-surges-past-casey-desantis-with-trump-backing/83412367007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Casey DeSantis announces her candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
