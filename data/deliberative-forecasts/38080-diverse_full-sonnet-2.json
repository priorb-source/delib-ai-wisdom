    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable perspectives that help refine my thinking. Forecaster 2 (92%) offers a compelling systematic analysis of the four-factor preliminary injunction test, correctly emphasizing that Harvard appears to meet all criteria convincingly. The TRO grant itself is indeed a strong signal, and the irreparable harm to 6,800 students is undeniable. Forecaster 3 (72%) raises important concerns about executive deference in immigration matters and potential appellate complications that I should weight more carefully. The mention of specific regulatory provisions (8 CFR 214.3) and the possibility of DHS reissuing a stronger revocation are valid points. However, I find Forecaster 3 may be slightly too cautious given the extremely short timeframe (33 days from May 29 to July 1) - even if complications arise, there's limited time for the government to effectuate the revocation before the resolution date. Forecaster 2's optimism is well-grounded, though 92% may underweight litigation uncertainty and the political dynamics at play.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast upward but remaining more cautious than Forecaster 2. The key factors supporting an increase: (1) The TRO grant is indeed a stronger positive signal than I initially weighted - federal judges don't issue TROs lightly, especially against executive immigration actions; (2) The four-factor test for preliminary injunction clearly favors Harvard on all dimensions; (3) The 33-day window from May 29 to July 1 is remarkably short, making it difficult for appellate intervention or administrative workarounds to take effect even if things go wrong; (4) The pretextual nature of the revocation (tied to political disputes rather than genuine SEVP compliance issues) limits traditional executive deference. However, I'm not moving to 92% because: (1) Courts do defer to executive authority on immigration matters, especially when national security is invoked; (2) The Trump administration has demonstrated unusual willingness to push legal boundaries; (3) Judges can surprise us, and the May 29 hearing outcome isn't guaranteed; (4) While unlikely, the First Circuit could expedite a stay. The balance tips toward continued certification through July 1, but meaningful uncertainty remains around the preliminary injunction hearing and potential complications.",
