    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a crucial point I completely missed: Laurent Gbagbo's legal status following a 2018 domestic conviction that allegedly stripped his civic rights. If Forecaster 2's information is accurate that Gbagbo has already been removed from the electoral list, this would fundamentally change the question from 'will anyone be disqualified?' to 'will this disqualification be reversed?'\n\nHowever, I'm concerned about a discrepancy: my research assistant's report doesn't mention Gbagbo being disqualified - it only mentions Thiam, Blé Goudé, and Soro. Forecaster 3 also doesn't treat Gbagbo's disqualification as confirmed, instead calling it 'unresolved status' and 'uncertainty.' This suggests Forecaster 2 may have information I lack, or may be interpreting ambiguous legal status as confirmed disqualification.\n\nForecaster 3's 38% forecast suggests they see elevated risk but not certainty. They correctly note the timing constraint and distinguish between being off the voter roll versus formal candidacy validation.\n\nThe key insight both forecasters share is that there ARE serious legal questions about at least one named candidate (Laurent Gbagbo) that I underweighted. Even if not formally confirmed as disqualified yet, the domestic conviction and civic rights issues create substantial risk of formal exclusion being confirmed by July 1 during the ongoing electoral list revision process.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too dismissive of the risks to the named candidates. While my initial analysis correctly noted that none had been explicitly mentioned in disqualification news, I failed to consider that Laurent Gbagbo's 2018 domestic conviction may have already rendered him legally ineligible, even if not yet processed through current electoral mechanisms.\n\nThe critical uncertainty is whether Gbagbo's civic rights loss constitutes existing disqualification that just needs confirmation, or whether additional formal administrative action is required. Forecaster 2's near-certainty (98%) assumes the former; Forecaster 3's moderate probability (38%) assumes significant but not overwhelming risk.\n\nGiven: (1) my research assistant's report doesn't explicitly confirm Gbagbo's current disqualification status, (2) Forecaster 3 treats it as unresolved rather than confirmed, and (3) we're in an active electoral list revision period where such issues would likely surface, I believe the probability is higher than my initial 28% but lower than Forecaster 2's 98%.\n\nThe most likely path to YES is confirmation during June's electoral list finalization that Gbagbo lacks civic rights and is ineligible. The path to NO is either that his rights have been quietly restored, or formal confirmation doesn't occur before July 1.",
