    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 months. The FATF June 2025 plenary typically occurs in late June, with outcomes published shortly thereafter, likely by early-to-mid July 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the grey list remains unchanged with the same 25 jurisdictions",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FATF reviews all jurisdictions under increased monitoring at its June plenary but determines that none have made sufficient progress in implementing their action plans to warrant removal. Additionally, no new jurisdictions are identified as having strategic AML/CFT deficiencies requiring addition to the list. The list remains static at 25 jurisdictions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the currently listed jurisdictions (such as Croatia, Bulgaria, or Monaco, which are higher-capacity countries) successfully implements its action plan and is removed from the grey list. Alternatively or additionally, the FATF identifies at least one new jurisdiction with strategic deficiencies and adds it to the increased monitoring list. Either type of change, or both, would resolve this question as Yes.",
    "rationale": "The FATF holds plenary meetings three times annually (February, June, October) and has a strong track record of making updates to its grey list at most meetings. The February 2025 update demonstrated active monitoring by removing the Philippines and adding Laos and Nepal, indicating the process is dynamic and responsive.\n\nSeveral factors support a high probability of changes: (1) Historical precedent shows that changes are more common than not at plenary meetings; (2) With 25 jurisdictions currently under monitoring, the statistical likelihood that at least one makes sufficient progress or faces new concerns is substantial; (3) Countries have strong incentives to exit the list due to reputational damage and increased compliance costs, motivating reform efforts; (4) The question's threshold is low - it requires only a single addition OR removal to resolve Yes.\n\nCountervailing considerations include: (1) Only 4 months have passed since the February changes, potentially limiting time for jurisdictions to demonstrate sufficient progress; (2) Implementing comprehensive AML/CFT reforms typically requires substantial time; (3) Without specific intelligence about which jurisdictions are near completion of their action plans, there's inherent uncertainty.\n\nHigher-capacity jurisdictions like Croatia, Bulgaria, and Monaco may be more likely to successfully complete their action plans relatively quickly. However, I lack specific information about their progress toward meeting FATF standards.\n\nMy forecast would increase significantly (to 85-90%) if I had evidence that specific jurisdictions were nearing completion of their action plans or if new jurisdictions were being publicly scrutinized. It would decrease (to 50-60%) if FATF had recently indicated a policy of reducing the frequency of list updates or if most monitored jurisdictions were early in their implementation processes.\n\nBalancing the strong historical pattern of changes against the modest time since the last update, I estimate a 75% probability of at least one change occurring.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring\" list, which at the time of this question consists of Algeria, Angola, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Mali, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Yemen. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
