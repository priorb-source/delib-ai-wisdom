  "information": "Anthropic's historical release cadence for major versions shows a lengthening gap: approximately 5 months between Claude 1 (March 2023) and Claude 2 (July 2023), and approximately 8 months between Claude 2 and Claude 3 (March 2024). Previous numbered Claude models have been made available to paid web users and via API within 48 hours of their announcement, without a public waitlist.\n\nAccording to reports from Cursor-IDE (May 15) and ZDNet (May 16), a next-generation Anthropic model codenamed 'Claude Neptune' completed its red-team testing phase on May 18. The same reports indicate a target for general availability in late May or early June. In the past, Anthropic has used internal codenames that later became part of public branding, such as the codename 'Asimov' for the models released as the Claude 3 family.\n\nA February 2025 report from Sina Finance described plans for Claude 4 to be a hybrid model combining a general-purpose model with a reasoning model, which would allow users to adjust the computational resources used for a given task. Other mentions in tech-focused publications, such as a March 2025 post on DEV Community and information on the PromptLayer blog, have framed the release of Claude 4 as expected 'later in 2025'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6-7 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Claude 4 is not currently available to the general public",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Claude Neptune turns out not to be Claude 4, or its release is delayed past July 1 due to additional safety testing, technical issues, or strategic timing decisions. Alternatively, Anthropic might release it under a different naming convention that doesn't include both 'Claude' and '4', or the release might require a waitlist initially.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Claude Neptune completes red-team testing as scheduled on May 18 and is publicly announced and released as Claude 4 (or as part of the Claude 4 family) in late May or early June 2025, following Anthropic's historical pattern of making models available to the general public within 48 hours of announcement without waitlists.",
    "rationale": "The key question is whether 'Claude Neptune' represents Claude 4. Supporting evidence includes: (1) Anthropic's precedent of using internal codenames that become public branding (Asimov → Claude 3), (2) Neptune's reported red-team completion on May 18 with target general availability in late May/early June - well before July 1, (3) timing alignment with roughly 14 months since Claude 3's March 2024 release, which fits an extended but plausible cadence. However, several factors lower confidence: (1) No explicit confirmation that Neptune equals Claude 4, (2) Multiple sources frame Claude 4 as coming 'later in 2025' which is ambiguous, (3) Companies frequently miss internal target dates, especially for major releases, (4) The lengthening release cadence (5 months, then 8 months) suggests possible 11+ month gaps going forward. The status quo should receive significant weight - Claude 4 doesn't exist publicly yet, and only 6-7 weeks remain until resolution. For my forecast to move higher (70-80%), I would need explicit confirmation that Neptune is Claude 4, or an official announcement with a specific near-term date. For it to move lower (30-40%), I would need reports of delays, clarification that Neptune is not Claude 4, or signals that the next major release won't be called Claude 4. The current evidence suggests moderate-high probability but falls short of high confidence given the lack of definitive confirmation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAnthropic's historical release cadence for major versions shows a lengthening gap: approximately 5 months between Claude 1 (March 2023) and Claude 2 (July 2023), and approximately 8 months between Claude 2 and Claude 3 (March 2024).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
