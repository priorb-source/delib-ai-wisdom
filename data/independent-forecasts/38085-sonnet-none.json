    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 30 days (from May 29, 2025 to June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - approximately 14.0 million residents remain in drought",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Florida enters its wet season (June-September) and receives above-average rainfall through June. Multiple tropical disturbances or widespread thunderstorm activity bring substantial precipitation, reducing drought conditions enough that the affected population drops below 14.0 million residents by June 28.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Drought conditions persist at current levels or worsen through late June. Despite entering the wet season, rainfall is insufficient to meaningfully reduce the drought footprint. The population living under drought conditions remains at or above the 14.0 million threshold established in late April.",
    "rationale": "According to the USA Today article dated April 28, 2025, Florida had exactly 14 million residents under drought conditions approximately one month before the current date. This establishes our baseline right at the resolution threshold. Several factors inform my forecast: (1) Temporal dynamics: Droughts typically change slowly and require sustained precipitation to ameliorate. One month is a relatively short timeframe for significant recovery. (2) Seasonal considerations: Florida's wet season runs June through September, with June marking the transition period. By June 28, we'll be approaching one month into the wet season, but substantial drought recovery may not yet have materialized. (3) Threshold positioning: The baseline of 14.0 million exactly matches the resolution criteria, meaning status quo conditions result in a YES outcome. This is crucial - the drought doesn't need to worsen, just persist. (4) Forecast uncertainty: The main factor that could drive a NO outcome is early and vigorous wet season activity. However, even in a typical wet season, drought recovery is gradual. My forecast is not higher (65-70%) because there is genuine uncertainty about early wet season rainfall patterns, and some amelioration over 30 days is plausible. My forecast is not lower (40-45%) because droughts exhibit strong persistence, the baseline is exactly at the threshold, and one month is insufficient time for dramatic improvement without exceptional rainfall. I would update higher if June weather forecasts showed continued dry patterns or La Niña conditions favoring drier weather. I would update lower if tropical systems or unusually wet patterns were forecast for June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
