  "information": "On January 20, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, ordering the renaming of the U.S. continental shelf off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to the 'Gulf of America'. Subsequently, he declared February 9 as the 'Day of the Gulf of America'. In response, several U.S. federal agencies have begun using the new name. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) updated its website graphics and tropical weather bulletins to use 'Gulf of America', and the U.S. Coast Guard has used the term in an official press release.\n\nThe adoption of the name 'Gulf of America' has varied among non-governmental entities. Google updated its Maps service to display 'Gulf of America' for users in the United States, while in other regions, both names are sometimes used. As of late January 2025, other major map publishers like National Geographic and Apple had not made the change. The renaming has generated international controversy, with Mexican officials, including President Claudia Sheinbaum, protesting the unilateral change. The International Hydrographic Organization, which works to standardize the names of bodies of water, has not officially recognized the new name.\n\nThe name 'Gulf of Mexico' has been established for centuries, dating back to the 16th century. The body of water is bordered by the United States, Mexico, and Cuba and is considered international waters under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. A previous proposal to rename it the 'Gulf of America' in 2012 was not approved. The website in question, WorldAtlas.com, is a Canadian-based company. While its main North America map currently displays 'Gulf of Mexico', the title of its specific article on the gulf reads: 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)'.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 54 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - WorldAtlas.com continues to display 'Gulf of Mexico' on their North America map page",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com maintains 'Gulf of Mexico' on their North America map page, choosing to follow international naming conventions rather than the US unilateral change. As a Canadian company not bound by US executive orders, and given the lack of international recognition from the IHO and controversy from Mexico, they keep the centuries-old established name on their main map.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com updates their North America map to show 'Gulf of America' or both names together, following the pattern they've already established in their article title 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)'. They decide to reflect current US federal usage, especially given adoption by Google Maps and multiple US agencies, updating their cartography in the remaining weeks before July 1st.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Despite Trump's Executive Order being signed on January 20, 2025 - over 3.5 months ago - WorldAtlas.com has not yet updated their North America map page to show the new name. This is significant because it suggests deliberate non-adoption or at least cautious consideration. However, their article about the gulf already displays 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)' in its title, indicating they are aware of and acknowledging the naming controversy. This creates some ambiguity about their intentions.\n\nKey factors favoring No: (1) WorldAtlas.com is Canadian-based and not subject to US executive orders; (2) The International Hydrographic Organization has not recognized the name change; (3) Major publishers like National Geographic and Apple had not adopted it as of late January; (4) The name 'Gulf of Mexico' has centuries of established usage; (5) International controversy and Mexican opposition make this politically sensitive; (6) Most importantly, 3.5 months have passed without the map being updated.\n\nKey factors favoring Yes: (1) Their article title already includes both names, showing consideration; (2) Multiple US federal agencies have adopted it (NHC, Coast Guard); (3) Google Maps displays it for US users; (4) There are still 54 days for them to make an update; (5) Web content can be changed quickly.\n\nThe most likely scenario is that WorldAtlas maintains their current approach - acknowledging both names in articles but keeping the traditional 'Gulf of Mexico' on their main cartographic products. The fact that they haven't changed after 3.5 months, combined with their international/Canadian perspective, suggests inertia toward the status quo. However, the acknowledgment in their article title and the reality of US federal adoption creates a non-trivial probability they might update their map in the remaining time.\n\nFor me to update higher, I would need evidence that WorldAtlas has announced plans to update their maps or that other major international mapping services have adopted the change. For me to update lower, I would need statements from WorldAtlas indicating they will not make this change or evidence that the US is retreating from this naming convention.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn January 20, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, ordering the renaming of the U.S. continental shelf off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to the 'Gulf of America'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
