  "information": "The case occurs within a broader context of the Trump administration's actions against individuals involved in pro-Palestinian activism. Reports indicate that since January 2025, the administration has revoked visas for over 1,000 foreign university students. Additionally, the Zionist organization Betar US announced it is working with the administration to help deport demonstrators it considers a threat, and has publicly named Mahmoud Khalil in its statements. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also written that allowing Khalil to remain in the country would create a “hostile environment for Jewish students.”",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 48 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Khalil remains detained while his legal challenge proceeds through the courts, with deportation delayed beyond July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Khalil's legal challenge to his detention succeeds or is still pending by July 1, resulting in court-ordered stays of deportation, procedural delays, or preliminary injunctions that prevent his removal from the United States before the deadline",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration expedites deportation proceedings, Khalil's legal challenges are quickly denied by courts, appeals are rejected or not granted stays, and immigration authorities physically remove him from the United States before July 1, 2025",
    "rationale": "The evidence suggests significant executive branch pressure to deport Khalil - Secretary of State Rubio's public statements, Betar US's involvement with the administration, and the pattern of 1,000+ visa revocations indicate strong political will. Khalil being already detained suggests proceedings are underway. However, the key phrase 'challenge to his detention moves forward' indicates active legal resistance, and US immigration law provides procedural protections that typically take time. Federal courts can grant stays of deportation, and contested immigration cases rarely resolve in under 48 days. The status quo strongly favors delay - legal proceedings move slowly, and successful challenges or even procedural motions can extend timelines beyond July 1. While the administration has shown willingness to act aggressively against pro-Palestinian activists, the legal system's pace typically constrains rapid deportations even in politically charged cases. I assign moderate probability because of the tension between strong executive motivation and legal/procedural constraints. My forecast would increase if courts deny his challenges or expedited proceedings are ordered; it would decrease with news of stays granted or favorable preliminary rulings.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mahmoud Khalil be deported before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mahmoud Khalil's challenge to his detention moves forward]()\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the United States deports Mahmoud Khalil before July 1, 2025. For purposes of this question, \"deported\" means Khalil being transported out of the territory of the United States against his will.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe case occurs within a broader context of the Trump administration's actions against individuals involved in pro-Palestinian activism. Reports indicate that since January 2025, the administration has revoked visas for over 1,000 foreign university students.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
