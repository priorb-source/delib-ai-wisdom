    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 2021 India–Pakistan ceasefire largely holds. Any flare-ups remain confined to the LoC/AJK areas (which do not count) or are non-kinetic. No mass-casualty terror attack in India traceable to Pakistan-based groups occurs, so Delhi sees no need to authorize punitive action into Pakistan proper. Routine border frictions (e.g., drones, smuggling, small-arms fire) do not escalate, and any firing that occurs along the international border is by the BSF (not the Armed Forces), thus not qualifying.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A high-casualty terror attack inside India in late May or June is credibly linked to Pakistan-based militants, prompting the Cabinet Committee on Security to authorize a limited punitive strike. The IAF conducts a Balakot-style air/missile/drone strike on a target in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, or the Army executes precision fires into Pakistani Punjab across the Working Boundary (and is clearly identified as the actor). Alternatively, India targets a militant facility in Sindh or Balochistan with standoff weapons. The action is reported credibly and attributable to the Indian Armed Forces.",
    "rationale": "Baseline and incentives: Cross-border kinetic strikes by India into Pakistan proper are rare; the salient modern precedent is the IAF’s February 2019 Balakot strike in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Most India–Pakistan violence occurs along the LoC/AKJ and would not count here. Nuclear risk and international pressure strongly discourage Indian operations deep inside Pakistan absent a major provocation. The political incentive for a June 2025 strike is modest without a triggering event; there is no immediate national election driver, and both sides typically prefer to avoid uncontrolled escalation. \n\nDefinition tightness: The question requires the attack to hit Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and be executed by the Indian Armed Forces (Army, Navy, Air Force). This excludes: (1) incidents in Pakistan-administered Kashmir (where most kinetic exchanges occur), and (2) cross-border firing by the BSF along the international border, since BSF is not part of the Armed Forces. These constraints materially lower odds. \n\nBase-rate framing: Since 2016 there has been one widely acknowledged strike in Pakistan proper (2019). That suggests a low annual base rate. Mapping that to a single-month window absent clear triggers implies a single-digit probability. \n\nEscalation channels: The main pathway to a Yes is a large, widely attributed terror attack in India prompting a limited, reputationally important strike (likely IAF) into KP or a precision standoff strike into Punjab/Sindh. Without such a shock, the status quo (No) is favored. Weather/operational considerations (early monsoon cloud cover by late June) mildly complicate air ops, further nudging odds down at the margin. \n\nWhy not higher: No specific trigger is known; the definitional exclusions (AKJ incidents, BSF fire) remove many common escalations; and the political/military costs of striking Pakistan proper remain high. \n\nWhy not lower: India has demonstrated willingness and capability (Balakot 2019) to conduct punitive strikes into KP. If a major terror incident occurs, a limited kinetic response in Pakistan proper within days is plausible. The existence of persistent militancy and periodic infiltration attempts keeps a non-zero tail risk. \n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of a mass-casualty terror attack in India attributed to Pakistan-based groups; emergency meetings of India’s CCS; unusual IAF forward deployments/NOTAMs near the border; public threats of retaliation from senior Indian officials; cross-border airspace closures; evacuation advisories for Indian border districts; a marked spike in ceasefire violations along the Working Boundary. \n\nWhat would move me down: Signals of de-escalation or backchannel engagement; reaffirmed ceasefire statements; a quiet first half of June with no serious incidents; diplomatic pressure/messages from major powers urging restraint; evidence that any border incidents are confined to AJK/LoC or involve only the BSF. \n\nResearch assistant summary: No additional information provided; the forecast relies on base rates, structural incentives, and definitional constraints.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack in Pakistan proper in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 India–Pakistan conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_conflict)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack on targets in one of the following provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nTo count, an attack must be [kinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_military_action), using explosive weaponry or physical violence. Non-kinetic actions such as a cyberattack would not count, even one resulting in deaths.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
