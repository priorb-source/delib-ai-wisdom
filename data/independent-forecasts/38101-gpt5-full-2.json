  "information": "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces criticism from Brexit supporters over concessions in a 'renewal' agreement with the EU. His government is also grappling with a sluggish economy, contributing to a decline in popularity. Starmer faces a growing political challenge from Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, whose economic plans he has described as reckless and comparable to the policies of former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Starmer's government plans to reduce the civil service by 50,000 jobs by 2030, aiming to save £2 billion annually, with details to be announced in a spending review on June 11.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's cabinet approval rating fell to a record low of 26% in a March 2025 Asahi newspaper poll. The 14-percentage-point drop followed a controversy involving the distribution of 100,000 yen gift vouchers to 15 lawmakers from the ruling party, which sparked public distrust. Although Ishiba apologized, he stated he used his own 'pocket money' as a sign of appreciation. All 15 lawmakers subsequently returned the vouchers. On the economic front, Ishiba is pursuing a growth-oriented economy driven by wage increases and investment, and has called for cooperation with the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren).\n\nPolling data from early 2025 shows fluctuating approval ratings for both leaders. A Morning Consult screenshot from early May reported Starmer at 36% and Ishiba at 29%, while other reports citing late-May figures placed Starmer at 28% and Ishiba at 32%. Earlier, a March 2025 Ipsos UK poll found that 30% of Britons believed Starmer was performing well, an increase of 7 percentage points. A YouGov poll from the same period showed Starmer with a 31% positive rating, his highest since September 2024. In April 2025, Starmer and Ishiba held a telephone call to discuss the economic impact of U.S. tariffs and agreed to cooperate on global issues.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (late-May reports have Morning Consult showing Starmer ~28% vs Ishiba ~32%, so Ishiba currently higher, and ties resolve No)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Starmer remains around the high-20s to ~30% through late June while Ishiba holds near ~30–32% or higher; or they tie on July 1 (ties resolve No). UK spending review and civil service cut headlines weigh on Starmer, while Ishiba’s scandal impact fades and wages/optimism nudge Japan’s approval slightly up.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starmer rebounds into the low/mid-30s by late June (e.g., benign economic prints, positive messaging around the June 11 spending review, or opposition missteps) while Ishiba stagnates in the high-20s due to renewed scandal coverage or economic dissatisfaction.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/status quo: Morning Consult snapshots cited show early May Starmer ~36% vs Ishiba ~29%, flipping by late May to Starmer ~28% vs Ishiba ~32%. Given the most recent indication favors Ishiba, the default outcome is No. Morning Consult uses a 7-day trailing average, so short-term moves can persist into early July. Ties count as No, slightly biasing the base rate against Yes.\n- UK dynamics: Starmer faces headwinds from a sluggish economy, criticism from Brexit supporters over EU ‘renewal’ concessions, pressure from Reform UK, and the June 11 spending review highlighting civil service cuts. These factors make a clean near-term rebound less certain. That said, UK PM approvals on MC often sit near low/mid-30s; the late-May ~28% could be a trough with some mean reversion possible if June macro news is neutral-to-positive (e.g., disinflation, rate-cut expectations) and messaging improves.\n- Japan dynamics: Ishiba’s cabinet approval hit 26% in March (Asahi) after the gift voucher issue; MC had him ~29% in early May and ~32% in late May per reports, suggesting partial recovery as the scandal receded. Structural patterns in Japan often keep PM approvals in the 20s–30s; a stable low-30s by early July is plausible, especially if wage narrative and cooperation with business continue.\n- Why not higher (than 50%): Latest comparative snapshot has Ishiba ahead; upcoming UK policy announcements could generate negative headlines; and tie risk penalizes Yes. \n- Why not lower: Historically, UK PM approvals on MC can sit above Japanese PM approvals; Starmer could revert to ~32–34% while Ishiba drifts back to high-20s if scandal resurfaces or economic sentiment weakens.\n- What would move me up: MC tracker showing Starmer clearly back to ≥32–33% by mid/late June; benign reception to the spending review; UK macro tailwinds; or fresh negative news in Japan pulling Ishiba back to ≤29%.\n- What would move me down: Continued UK slide/sub-30% readings into mid/late June; backlash to civil service cuts; Reform UK surge driving unfavorable headlines; or Ishiba holding ≥31–33% with improving economic sentiment.\nBalancing these, I lean slightly No, but view it as close to a coin flip.",

Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.
