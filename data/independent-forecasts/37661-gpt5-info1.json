  "information": "The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) granted two 10-year licenses to Starlink Services Bangladesh Limited, as reported on April 30, 2025. This allows the company to provide commercial internet services and import necessary equipment. The approval followed Starlink's registration with the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) on March 29, 2025. Public statements from SpaceX executives and Bangladeshi government officials have targeted a May 2025 launch. In late March, interim leader Muhammad Yunus announced plans to finalize a commercial deal with Starlink within three months. A trial run of the service was conducted on April 9, 2025, during an investment summit.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the Starlink map continues to show Bangladesh as not available.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite licenses, operational/logistics or compliance steps slip: import/distribution of user terminals stalls, required local interconnection or lawful intercept arrangements take longer, payment/local currency setup lags, or SpaceX prioritizes other markets. The map stays at Coming Soon through June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following April licensing and April trial, Starlink enables consumer service (or at least some service tier) in parts of Bangladesh, opens orders to Bangladeshi addresses, and updates the availability map to show at least some cells in Bangladesh as Available before July 1.",
    "rationale": "I put substantial weight on the current map status (not yet available), since status quo often persists. However, several recent, concrete milestones materially increase the odds of a near-term change: per the research assistant, (1) Starlink registered with BIDA on Mar 29, 2025; (2) BTRC granted two 10‑year licenses on Apr 30, 2025 to provide commercial internet services and import equipment; (3) a public trial was conducted on Apr 9; and (4) public statements by SpaceX and Bangladeshi officials targeted a May 2025 launch. In other countries, the Starlink map typically flips to Available close to the first day orders are accepted, often soon after regulatory clearance.\n\nReasons it’s not higher: short-term execution risks remain. Even with ISL, some markets require local gateways/interconnect or compliance features (lawful intercept, content controls). Delays in customs/import, distribution, pricing/tax setup, or payment rails (e.g., currency controls) could push the consumer-facing launch to July or later. There’s also non-zero political or incumbent opposition risk, and sometimes website/map updates lag operational readiness.\n\nReasons it’s not lower: Bangladesh has already issued the core licenses and allowed a public trial, signaling policy alignment. The government appears motivated, and the stated launch window is within our 6‑week horizon. Starlink’s recent regional rollouts (e.g., other Asian markets post-approval) suggest they can move quickly once licenses are in hand.\n\nWhat would move me up: evidence of orders opening for Bangladeshi addresses, local pricing going live, confirmed shipment of kits to Bangladeshi customers, Starlink support docs listing Bangladesh as active, or official BTRC/SpaceX announcements with a firm June service date.\n\nWhat would move me down: credible reports of regulatory conditions (e.g., gateway/intercept requirements) not yet satisfied, import/billing obstacles, legal challenges by incumbents, or silence past mid‑June with no sign-ups or shipping in Bangladesh.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Bangladesh as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Bangladeshi leader gives final approval to Musk's Starlink service](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/bangladeshi-leader-gives-final-approval-to-musks-starlink-service/3551404)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Bangladesh listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) granted two 10-year licenses to Starlink Services Bangladesh Limited, as reported on April 30, 2025. This allows the company to provide commercial internet services and import necessary equipment.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
