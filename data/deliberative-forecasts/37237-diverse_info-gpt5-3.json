    "review": "Forecaster 2 added a key point I hadn’t incorporated explicitly: March 2025 reportedly set a record (~$342.7B) likely due to front‑running tariffs, and the April 2024 threshold ($338.483B) is just ~1.2% below that record. That makes a ‘Yes’ require an exceptionally strong April—unlikely right after a pull‑forward spike. This is a persuasive, concrete argument that shifts me lower. Forecaster 3’s direction-of-travel is consistent (softness in goods from China, port activity), but the magnitudes cited (30–40%+ overall declines) seem implausibly large and likely reflect selective or non-comparable indicators (TEUs vs value, partial-month reads, specific lanes). I discount their size claims but accept the directional pressure toward a weaker April.",
    "rationale": "I initially leaned slightly ‘No’ at 42% ‘Yes,’ balancing evident April goods softness (blank sailings, weaker Asia–US rates, China exposure) against resilient services and trade diversion to Mexico. Forecaster 2’s pull‑forward argument meaningfully strengthens the ‘No’ case: if March was a record due to front‑running, a reversion in April makes exceeding April 2024’s high bar much harder. Given the threshold is near record territory, April would need to remain exceptionally strong despite the unwind—unlikely under the reported shipping conditions. Forecaster 3’s extreme declines are not credible in magnitude, but they reinforce the direction that April goods likely softened, especially from China. Services imports and Mexico’s strength still offer some offset, so I don’t go as low as 15–25%. Net: I lower my ‘Yes’ probability from 42% to 30%, reflecting a higher likelihood that total April 2025 imports fall short of $338.483B, while preserving some chance that services strength and non‑China suppliers keep totals elevated.",
