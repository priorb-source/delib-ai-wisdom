    "review": "All three forecasters are in strong agreement on the core narrative: the recent 'plunge' in consumer sentiment, as mentioned in the background information, creates significant downward momentum, making an outcome below 60.0 (a 'No' resolution) the more likely scenario. Our probabilities are tightly clustered between 35% and 45%. The other forecasters reinforced the concept of sentiment inertia or 'downward stickiness,' which is a key driver. The most insightful new point was raised by Forecaster 3, who correctly noted that we lack the quantitative data for the May 2025 starting point. The 'plunge' could have been from a high level to one still above 60.0, which introduces a key uncertainty that argues against excessive pessimism. Their reasoning was highly convincing and highlighted the primary tension between the known negative momentum and the unknown starting value.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 45% to 40%. The deliberation process crystallized the consensus view that the downward momentum from a 'plunge' is a powerful force that is difficult to reverse in a single month. Both other forecasters emphasized this inertia more strongly than I initially did, and I find their collective judgment persuasive. My initial 45% may have been slightly too optimistic about the possibility of a quick rebound. While I agree with Forecaster 3's excellent point about the uncertainty of the exact May number (the starting point for June), I believe the group's consensus on the strength of negative momentum warrants a more pessimistic stance. This 5-point downward adjustment brings my forecast in line with Forecaster 3, reflecting a better balance between the powerful downward inertia and the remaining uncertainties.",
