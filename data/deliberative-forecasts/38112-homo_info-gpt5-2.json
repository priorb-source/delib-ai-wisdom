    "review": "New and useful points from the others: (1) Brazil’s host-year caution via Celso Amorim’s May remarks about stabilizing before further enlargement—this is a meaningful, summit-relevant constraint I hadn’t explicitly incorporated. (2) Reports that Rio’s draft agenda emphasizes financial architecture with non-committal language on enlargement—if accurate, that lowers odds further. (3) The April 2025 foreign ministers’ meeting failing to produce a joint communiqué is a concrete sign of coordination frictions that raises the bar for a fresh invite on a tight timeline. (4) The guest list (Mexico, Uruguay, Colombia) signals regional engagement but not necessarily immediate accession. \n\nAssessment of their reasoning: Forecaster 2’s 15% is well-argued on host caution and unanimity; I slightly question how definitive the agenda signals are this far out, but directionally I agree. Forecaster 3’s 38% feels high given the same unanimity/host constraints and the April frictions; while a fast-track upgrade is possible, there are ample alternative deliverables (finance/institutions) that reduce the need for a membership ‘win.’ Overall, their inputs push me downward from my prior.\n",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~5 weeks. Status quo bias favors No, since an invitation requires a visible, unanimous, affirmative decision. Since my prior (28%), three items move the needle down: (a) Brazil’s explicit preference to consolidate in its host year; (b) lack of strong pre-summit signaling or leaks naming a candidate; (c) April foreign ministers’ failure to agree on a communiqué—suggesting limited appetite/capacity to fix expansion details before July. The research assistant’s note that Kazakhstan ruled out full membership also trims the plausible pool. Several partners (Algeria, Turkey, Vietnam) haven’t even confirmed partner participation, making near-term elevation unlikely. India’s known caution plus Brazil’s stabilization message together imply that China/Russia would need to secure a consensus candidate that is low-controversy and low-cost for India/Brazil—perhaps Malaysia or Thailand—but we have no public indications of such a pre-baked deal. \n\nCountervailing factors keep the probability above very low: expansion remains a stated goal; a stocked partner pipeline exists; Indonesia’s January 2025 accession shows procedural flexibility for rapid moves. A surprise single-candidate deal is not impossible, especially if positioned as geographically balancing and economically complementary. \n\nNet: The added evidence of host-year caution and April frictions makes a fresh invitation at or before Rio less likely than I previously assessed. I reduce from 28% to 20%. Triggers for an upward revision: credible leaks naming a consensus candidate; synchronized Brazil–India statements softening on expansion; sherpa/Parliamentary Forum language welcoming “new members.” Downward triggers: explicit Brazil/India statements pausing enlargement; authoritative agenda reporting that membership is off the table at Rio; continued lack of pre-summit signaling by late June.\n",
