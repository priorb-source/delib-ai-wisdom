    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Ohio does not enact new legislation expanding citizenship verification for voters, and the existing requirements for voter registration and voting remain unchanged.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite being introduced with support from the Republican supermajority, the legislative process for the relevant bill (e.g., SB 153) does not conclude before the July 1, 2025 deadline. The bill may get delayed in committee hearings, be deprioritized in favor of other legislative business, or require more time for debate and reconciliation between the two chambers than the short window allows.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Republican leadership in both the Ohio Senate and House prioritizes the passage of an election integrity bill expanding voter citizenship verification. They use their supermajority to fast-track the legislation through the committee process and floor votes, ensuring an identical version is passed by both chambers and enacted before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 30% is primarily based on the conflict between strong political will and a very short legislative timeline. On one hand, the Republican party holds a supermajority in both the Ohio House and Senate, giving them the power to pass legislation without opposition and override a potential gubernatorial veto. The recent introduction of Senate Bill 153 on May 1, 2025, by members of the majority party is a clear signal of intent and provides a concrete vehicle for this policy change. This demonstrates that the political motivation is present.\n\nOn the other hand, the status quo is a powerful force, and legislative inertia is a significant factor. The deadline of July 1, 2025, is less than two months away. For a new bill to proceed from introduction through committee hearings, floor votes in two separate chambers, and potential reconciliation of differing versions within such a compressed timeframe is highly ambitious, even for a priority bill. The legislative process has many procedural steps that take time, and other issues can easily divert the legislature's attention.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the political alignment in Ohio is exceptionally favorable for such a bill to pass. The GOP has demonstrated its ability to pass controversial election-related legislation previously, such as the photo ID law in 2023. If the leadership makes this a top priority, they have the procedural tools to expedite it. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the timeline is the single greatest obstacle. Without a pressing, external deadline (like an upcoming election before July 1st), the urgency may not be sufficient to overcome the natural pace of the legislative process. It is more plausible that the bill passes later in the 2025 legislative session than it is that it completes the entire process in under eight weeks.\n\nI would increase my forecast if the bill clears a committee in either chamber within the next two weeks. I would decrease it if the bill shows no movement by early June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
