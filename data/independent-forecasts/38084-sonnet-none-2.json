    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 30 days until June 28, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - drought conditions persist or worsen as California enters peak dry season",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Fewer than 20 million residents are currently in drought areas, and conditions either remain stable or improve slightly due to unexpected late spring rainfall. Alternatively, drought may be concentrated in less populated rural areas rather than major metropolitan regions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Current drought conditions already affect close to or more than 20 million residents and persist through June, or drought expands further into heavily populated coastal regions (Los Angeles, Bay Area, San Diego metros) as California enters the driest part of the year with no significant precipitation.",
    "rationale": "The article headline indicates California's drought has 'returned' and is 'already bad' as of late May. With only 30 days until resolution and California entering its typically driest season (summer), status quo bias strongly favors current conditions persisting or worsening rather than improving. California's total population is approximately 39 million, so 20 million represents just over 50% of residents. Major population centers include the LA metro (~13M), Bay Area (~7-8M), and San Diego (~3M). If drought is 'already bad,' it's plausible these regions are affected. June is historically very dry in California, making significant rainfall unlikely. However, key uncertainties include: (1) the exact current number of residents in drought areas - the article doesn't provide specific figures; (2) whether 'already bad' means we're at, above, or below the 20M threshold currently; and (3) the geographical distribution of drought relative to population centers. My forecast would be higher if I had current data showing we're already at 18-19 million residents in drought, or if it were July/August instead of June. It would be lower if current data showed only 10-15 million affected, or if there were forecasts of unusual June rainfall.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
