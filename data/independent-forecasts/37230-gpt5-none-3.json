    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month; outcome will be known after the close on the final trading day of May 2025 (likely Friday, May 30).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — on a one‑month horizon the S&P 500 finishes higher slightly more often than not.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A hotter‑than‑expected May CPI/PPI or hawkish Fed messaging pushes yields up; mega‑cap earnings/guidance disappoint (especially AI‑linked names); credit spreads widen and risk sentiment sours, leading to a month‑end close below April’s final close.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Inflation data is benign and rate‑cut odds firm; earnings and guidance from large caps (especially tech/AI) come in strong; buybacks and stable financial conditions support a grind higher into month‑end, producing a May close above April’s close.",
    "rationale": "Base rates dominate on a 1‑month horizon. Historically, the S&P 500 posts a positive monthly return roughly 55–60% of the time, and May specifically is not reliably negative despite the “Sell in May” adage. With no new, specific information from the research assistant, I weight the status quo (slight upward drift amid earnings season and ongoing buybacks) more heavily. Key known drivers in May include: an FOMC meeting/tone, mid‑month inflation prints, and heavyweight earnings (which can materially sway the cap‑weighted index). Reasons the probability isn’t higher: concentrated index leadership raises downside if a few mega‑caps miss; macro surprises (sticky inflation, higher yields) could quickly pressure valuations; the April 30 close (the anchor) is not yet set—if April ends on a strong spike, it raises the bar for May. Reasons it isn’t lower: base‑rate positivity, resilient US growth, ongoing buybacks, and the tendency for benign data/earnings to support modest monthly gains. What would move me up: a soft April 30 close (making the hurdle easier), dovish Fed tone, cooler‑than‑expected inflation, strong mega‑cap results/guidance, narrowing credit spreads, and improving breadth. What would move me down: an April 30 spike to new highs (raising the hurdle), hawkish Fed surprises, hotter inflation, disappointing mega‑cap earnings, rising yields/credit spreads, or a geopolitical shock.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the S&P 500 index go up in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Times: [What Is a Bear Market? Are We in One?](https://www.nytimes.com/article/bear-market-stocks-tariffs.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the closing value of the S&P 500 Index on the final trading day of May 2025 is higher than that of the final trading day of April 2025.\n\nThe \"close\" values shown on the [history page of Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC) will be used.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
