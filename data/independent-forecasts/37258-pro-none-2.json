    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No date for a Scottish independence referendum will be officially announced by the Scottish government.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish government, constrained by the UK Supreme Court's 2022 ruling and focusing on other political priorities, does not announce a specific date for a referendum. The existing political deadlock on the issue between Edinburgh and London persists through the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a bold political move, potentially to energize the independence base or respond to a specific UK government action, the Scottish First Minister officially announces a date for a consultative independence referendum, despite the lack of a Section 30 order from the UK Parliament.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on three main factors: the very short timeframe, the significant legal and political barriers, and the established status quo. With less than two months until the July 1, 2025 deadline, there is little time for the Scottish government to alter its current strategy and make such a momentous announcement. The primary obstacle is the 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling that the Scottish Parliament cannot legislate for a referendum without UK Parliament consent. While the question allows for a 'Yes' even if the referendum is declared illegal by the UK, announcing a non-binding, legally questionable referendum is a high-risk political strategy that the SNP leadership has so far avoided. The status quo is that no referendum is scheduled, and this is a stable situation due to these powerful constraints. While the provided polling data shows a lead for 'Yes', a single poll is insufficient to trigger an announcement; leaders typically require a sustained and significant lead before making such a move. Therefore, the path of least resistance and greatest political caution is to not announce a date in the immediate future. My probability is not lower than 5% because a surprise political gambit by the First Minister can't be completely ruled out, especially in a volatile political climate. The criteria for the question (an announcement is sufficient, regardless of UK legality) makes this a possibility. My probability is not higher because the barriers are substantial and the timeframe is extremely compressed, making a change to the status quo highly unlikely. I would raise my forecast if we saw a series of polls confirming a large independence lead and rhetoric from SNP leadership pointing towards an imminent announcement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
