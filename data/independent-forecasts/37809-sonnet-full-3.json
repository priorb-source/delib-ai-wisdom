  "information": "As of mid-to-late May 2025, New York Yankees player Aaron Judge had a batting average at or above .400. Reports from May 20th list his average as .401, while other reports from the preceding week cited it as high as .410 and .423. Through his first 46 games, he had a batting average of 0.401. His Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP) was .481, compared to his career average of .344. Statcast data calculated his expected batting average (xBA) at approximately .362.\n\nAs of May 18, 2025, Freddie Freeman of the Los Angeles Dodgers led the National League with a batting average of .375. Other top hitters in the NL included Will Smith (.336), Brendan Donovan (.330), and Manny Machado (.323). One report also listed Shohei Ohtani's average at .370. In contrast, three-time All-Star Marcus Semien was batting .174 for the Texas Rangers.\n\nHistorically, maintaining a .400 batting average is extremely rare in modern baseball. No MLB player has finished a season batting .400 since Ted Williams in 1941. Furthermore, no player in the last 25 seasons has had a batting average of .400 or greater on July 1. In 2023, Luis Arraez's average was .401 on June 23 but fell to .392 by July 1. Factors contributing to this difficulty include lower league-wide Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP), which is .288 in the current era compared to .300 in 1930.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 42 days (July 1, 2025 is 6 weeks away from May 20, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Aaron Judge remains at or near .400 batting average, resulting in a YES outcome",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Judge's batting average regresses toward his expected batting average of .362 as his unsustainably high BABIP of .481 normalizes toward his career .344. Over the next 35-40 games, his average drops below .400, and no other player (Freeman at .375, Ohtani at .370) gets hot enough to reach .400.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Judge maintains his exceptional hitting through early summer, defying statistical expectations and keeping his average at or above .400 through July 1. Alternatively, Freddie Freeman or Shohei Ohtani goes on a sustained hot streak over the next 6 weeks to reach .400.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires balancing a favorable current situation against extremely strong historical and statistical indicators pointing toward regression. The key evidence: (1) Aaron Judge currently sits at .401, just above the threshold, giving him minimal cushion. (2) His BABIP of .481 is 137 points above his career average of .344, indicating extreme unsustainability. (3) His expected batting average of .362 is 39 points below his actual average, suggesting significant regression is statistically likely. (4) The historical base rate is stark: zero players have had a .400+ average on July 1 in the past 25 seasons. (5) The cautionary tale of Luis Arraez in 2023, who dropped from .401 to .392 in just 8 days from June 23 to July 1, demonstrates how quickly averages can fall even from similar starting points. However, the forecast isn't lower because: Judge does have 6 weeks of runway at .401, there are backup candidates in Freeman (.375) and Ohtani (.370), and maintaining .400 for 6 weeks is more achievable than for a full season. The forecast isn't higher because the statistical indicators and historical precedent are so uniformly negative. I would update higher if Judge's xBA were closer to his actual BA or if multiple players were above .390. I would update lower if Judge were barely above .400 or if his recent performance showed decline.",
