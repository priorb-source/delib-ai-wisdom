  "information": "According to reports in mid-April 2025 from sources including uol.com.br and Sports.ru, Johnny Walker was scheduled to fight the undefeated Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316 on June 7-8 in Newark, New Jersey. At the time of the announcement, Murzakanov held a professional record of 14-0 and was noted for winning three of his four UFC bouts by knockout or technical knockout. He was returning from an 180-day suspension for an anti-doping violation, which was set to end on May 1, 2025. Walker's record was cited as 21-9, and he was entering the fight on a two-fight losing streak.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12 days (until June 7–8, 2025, UFC 316 fight night)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — fight proceeds as scheduled and Murzakanov, the likely favorite, wins",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The bout happens and Murzakanov wins by early KO/TKO or decision; or the matchup is canceled/changed; or the fight occurs but ends in a draw/No Contest (Walker does not defeat him)",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Fight goes ahead and Walker uses his height/reach, outside kicking game, and clinch threats to stay safe from counters, outpoints Murzakanov for a decision or scores a mid/late stoppage",
    "rationale": "Timing: The event is roughly 12 days away, so late pull-outs are possible but less likely than earlier in camp. Even so, any cancellation or opponent change resolves to No. Competitively: Per the assistant’s summary, Murzakanov is 14-0 with notable stoppage power and is coming off a 180‑day suspension that ended May 1, 2025. Walker (21-9) is on a two-fight skid. Stylistically, Murzakanov’s compact, powerful counter-punching is a bad matchup for Walker’s historically fragile defense and chin; Walker has been stopped by big punchers before. That makes Murzakanov the rightful favorite if they fight. Reasons Walker has real chances: massive height/reach advantage, strong kicking game at range, and the possibility Murzakanov shows some ring rust or cardio fade in later rounds (he has slowed in past fights). Walker’s volatility and finishing ability mean he can win if he fights disciplined and avoids the left-hand counters. Decomposition: P(fight occurs) ~ 0.85–0.90 given proximity to event and typical UFC late-camp cancellation rates; conditional on fighting, I estimate Walker win chance ~ 33–37% (underdog versus unbeaten power puncher, but with meaningful size/variance upside). Multiplying yields ~28–33% overall Yes, also acknowledging draws/NCs are rare but count against Yes. Why not higher: Undefeated opponent with KO power versus Walker’s defensive lapses and recent KO loss(es); likely 3-round bout favors the faster starter. Why not lower: Walker’s athleticism and reach, opponent’s recent inactivity/suspension, and Walker’s capacity to win a rangy decision or catch a finish. What would move me up: Evidence of Murzakanov travel/visa issues, injury rumors, rough weight cut, or widely reported gym footage suggesting cardio problems; sharp market move toward Walker; confirmation of 5 rounds (unlikely) would also slightly help Walker. What would move me down: Reports of a strong Murzakanov camp, Walker injury/weight issues, or credible market drift toward Murzakanov; any hint the matchup might be rebooked or changed (which would push closer to No).",
