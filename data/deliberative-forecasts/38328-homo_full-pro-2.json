    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the primary drivers for this question: the high baseline rate of MEP turnover, the acute pressure from the Huawei scandal, and the independent possibility of MEPs resigning to take up national government posts. Forecaster 2's quantification of the baseline probability using a Poisson distribution (~65% chance of one or more resignations) provides a useful analytical anchor that supports a high probability. The most impactful argument, however, came from Forecaster 3, who pointed out a critical nuance in the resolution criteria that I had not sufficiently weighted: a resignation must be announced *after* June 9. The MEP who was arrested today, June 5, is under the most immediate pressure and could plausibly resign in the next four days, before the resolution window opens. This is a specific and highly relevant failure mode for a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 80% was based on the powerful convergence of routine turnover, a major scandal, and national political dynamics. After reviewing the other analyses, I am making a slight downward adjustment. The core reasoning remains the same, as all three drivers point towards a high probability of a resignation. However, Forecaster 3 persuasively argued that the most likely candidate from the scandal, the MEP arrested on June 5, is under intense pressure to resign *now*, before the resolution window opens on June 10. A resignation from him before that date would not trigger a 'Yes' resolution. This introduces a specific timing risk I had previously undervalued. While the other factors—including the high baseline rate and the looming immunity votes for four other MEPs—still make a resignation within the window very likely, this new failure path is significant enough to warrant a small correction. I am therefore lowering my forecast from 80% to 78%.",
