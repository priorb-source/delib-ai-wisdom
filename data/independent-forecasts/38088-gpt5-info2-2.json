  "information": "Analysis of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index indicates several distribution patterns. U.S. representation is strongest in the top tiers but diminishes at lower rankings. In the 200-300 range, approximately 62% of positions are occupied by non-U.S. billionaires. Over the past year, overall U.S. representation in the top 500 has reportedly declined from 40% to around 35%. Some analyses suggest a seasonal variability, with U.S. billionaires showing stronger representation in the fourth quarter and weaker representation in the first and second quarters.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of Apr 30, 2025 the 250th-ranked person (Giancarlo Devasini) is listed as Italian, i.e., non-U.S.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 250th slot remains occupied by a non-U.S. billionaire—either Devasini stays near that rank or a nearby non-U.S. billionaire takes the spot due to typical day-to-day moves, continued relative strength of non-U.S. names in the 200–300 band, and/or seasonal Q2 softness for U.S. representation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A U.S. billionaire edges into the 250th slot by July 1, driven by late-June equity gains for U.S. mid-tier billionaires, USD strength versus major currencies (denting non-U.S. USD-converted net worths), or a dip in the wealth of the current non-U.S. names around ranks 245–255.",
    "rationale": "Base rates and the current lineup point to No. The research assistant’s summary indicates that in the 200–300 range about 62% are non-U.S. (so only ~38% U.S.), and U.S. share of the top 500 has reportedly slipped from ~40% to ~35% over the past year. There’s also a suggested seasonal pattern with relatively weaker U.S. representation in Q1–Q2. As of Apr 30, the actual 250th was non-U.S. (Italy). With just ~1 month to go, rank movements are frequent but typically incremental, and the local ‘pool’ around rank 250 is more likely to be non-U.S. than U.S. Given the status quo is non-U.S. and the base rate for U.S. in this band is below 50%, the odds favor No. Why not higher? The combination of a non-U.S. incumbent at 250, a non-U.S.-heavy pool in the 200–300 band, and a recent downtrend in U.S. share argues against a coin-flip or better. Why not lower? The 250th slot can change on daily market and FX moves; there are likely several U.S. candidates within a few ranks, and a modest late-June U.S. equity rally or USD appreciation could easily tip a U.S. billionaire into exactly 250th. What would move me up: clear evidence in mid/late June that multiple U.S. billionaires are clustered in the 245–255 range; a notable outperformance of U.S. equities; USD strengthening vs EUR/CNY; or Bloomberg methodology updates that lift U.S. private valuation marks near this rank. What would move me down: continued underperformance of U.S. mid-caps vs non-U.S., USD weakness, or evidence that the band around 250 is dominated by non-U.S. names with a comfortable cushion.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked name on the list was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025. It resolves as **No** if the 250th-ranked person is from any other country.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the \"median\" from the question's title is defined as the 250th ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, no matter how many are on the list.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAnalysis of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index indicates several distribution patterns.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
