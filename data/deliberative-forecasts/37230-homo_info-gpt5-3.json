    "review": "Both forecasters anchor appropriately to the monthly base rate and emphasize the event-heavy early May calendar. I found Forecaster 3’s reminder about the mechanical effect of April’s final close particularly useful—where April ends sets the bar for May. Their point about a late-April rebound raising the risk of giveback and VIX being elevated (if accurate) reasonably tilts the distribution toward more two-sided risk. Forecaster 2 adds trade/tariff policy as a potential drag, citing EPS sensitivity to tariff changes; that’s a valid medium-run headwind, though I suspect its incremental impact on a one-month horizon is modest unless there’s a clear, market-moving announcement in May. I’m slightly cautious about treating the specific VIX level and magnitude of the late-April move as certain without verification, but directionally the arguments are sound. Overall, their reasoning supports staying near the base rate with a mild downward shade for valuation/volatility and policy risk.",
    "rationale": "Starting from a ~58–60% monthly base rate, May’s setup is binary around earnings (mega-caps still to report), inflation prints (March PCE, then April CPI mid-May), and the May 7 FOMC. Valuations are rich, and if late April indeed saw a strong rebound with elevated implied volatility, the risk of a partial retracement in May rises. Trade/tariff headlines add an overhang but likely matter only if concrete measures hit. Offsetting these are still-resilient earnings, reopened buybacks post-earnings, and the usual monthly positive drift. The unknown April 30 reference close is important: a high close would slightly lower the odds for May; a weak close would raise them. On balance, I keep a modest edge to Yes but shade my prior 57% down by 1 point to reflect the added asymmetry from valuation/volatility and the possibility that April ends on strength, raising May’s bar.",
