    "review": "New and useful inputs: (1) The May 29 snapshot reportedly had Vladimir Potanin (Russia) at #250, adding a second recent non-U.S. data point and mildly reinforcing the No lean. (2) Clear articulation that U.S. share around the median is roughly one-third and that volatility around rank ~250 is substantial. (3) Helpful separation of drivers: large-cap U.S. tech strength likely matters little for mid-ranks; FX could be pivotal (USD vs EUR/CNY); idiosyncratic events (e.g., crypto for Devasini/Tether) can swing near-rank names. I largely agree. Their arguments are consistent with my prior view: below-even odds but not too low due to churn and the U.S. being the single largest national cohort. I don’t see strong new evidence to move meaningfully upward; if anything, the additional non-U.S. occupancy at #250 slightly reinforces the No side.",
    "rationale": "Anchor on base rates: around the 200–300 band, U.S. representation is roughly one-third to high-30s, and the U.S. share of the top 500 has been drifting down toward ~35%. Recent observed incumbents at #250 (Apr 30: Italy; May 29: Russia) were non-U.S., which modestly tilts toward No over a one-month horizon. Seasonal/temporal note that U.S. representation is weaker in Q1–Q2 also leans No. Countervailing forces exist: rank ~250 is churn-heavy; USD strength or relative U.S. equity outperformance into late June could nudge a U.S. billionaire into the slot on the snapshot date. Large-cap U.S. tech leadership is unlikely to matter for this rank. Netting these, my prior 34% already reflected a below-base lean due to the non-U.S. incumbency and recent U.S. share drift. The added May 29 data point is directionally consistent but not large enough to warrant a further change. I will hold at 34%. What would move me up: clear clustering of U.S. names in 247–253 in late June; USD strengthening vs EUR/CNY; relative U.S. mid-cap/founder wealth outperformance. What would move me down: persistent late-June checks showing #250 non-U.S. and a 245–255 band dominated by non-U.S.; USD weakness; RoW equities outperforming U.S. into month-end.",
