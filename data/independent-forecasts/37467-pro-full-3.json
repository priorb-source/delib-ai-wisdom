  "information": "Beyond Meat's financial results for the first quarter of 2025 showed a 9.1% year-over-year decline in net revenues to $68.7 million. The company reported a net loss of $52.9 million and a gross loss of $1.1 million, resulting in a gross margin of -1.5%. While the company's international business revenue grew, its U.S. retail channel revenue fell by 15.4%. Citing weak consumer demand and macroeconomic volatility, Beyond Meat withdrew its annual sales forecast for 2025 and issued a revised outlook for the second quarter with expected net revenues between $80 million and $85 million.\n\nAs of March 2025, Beyond Meat had $116 million in cash on hand. The company's liabilities included $1.15 billion in convertible bonds maturing in 2027, which were reported to be trading at 17 cents on the dollar. On May 7, 2025, the company announced it had secured a new $100 million senior secured financing facility. The loan has an initial term of 4.75 years with an interest rate of 12% until February 2030, payable in kind, meaning interest is added to the loan's principal instead of being paid in cash during this period.\n\nIn response to its financial performance, Beyond Meat has implemented several operational changes, including a 17% workforce reduction for non-production staff and a suspension of its operations in China. Management stated its strategic priorities include restoring product distribution within the U.S. market and improving consumer perception through new marketing campaigns. The stated long-term goal for the company is to achieve EBITDA-positive operations by the end of 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Slightly less than two months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Beyond Meat leverages its new financing and cost-cutting measures to continue operations beyond the resolution date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The company uses its newly secured $100 million financing facility to fund its operations and cover losses through the second quarter, successfully avoiding an immediate liquidity crisis and pushing any potential bankruptcy filing beyond July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the new financing, a severe and unexpected event, such as a major creditor action, a breach of the new loan's covenants due to rapidly deteriorating performance, or a sudden board decision to preserve remaining value, forces the company into a bankruptcy filing before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the very short time horizon of the question. While Beyond Meat's financial health is extremely poor, as evidenced by its Q1 2025 losses and weak revenue, the company took a decisive step to ensure its short-term survival. On May 7, 2025, it secured a new $100 million senior secured financing facility. This injection of capital, combined with its existing cash reserves, provides a crucial lifeline intended to fund operations for the coming months. It is highly improbable that a company would secure such a significant loan only to declare bankruptcy within weeks. The loan's terms, particularly the 'payment-in-kind' interest feature, are designed to conserve cash in the immediate term. Furthermore, major liabilities like the $1.15 billion in convertible bonds do not mature until 2027, removing them as an immediate cause for a filing before July 2025. My forecast is not lower than 8% because the company is in a distressed state. A non-trivial risk remains that a covenant on the new loan could be breached, a sudden market shock could occur, or a significant operational failure could accelerate a collapse. The bonds trading at 17 cents on the dollar reflect a market that has priced in a high long-term probability of default, which creates a volatile environment. My forecast is not higher because the new financing explicitly addresses the most likely cause of a near-term bankruptcy: a liquidity crisis. For the company to file before July 1, something would have to go catastrophically wrong very quickly, defying the purpose of the recent capital raise. I would increase my probability if news emerged of a covenant breach, a major product recall, or a pre-announcement of sales falling drastically below the revised Q2 forecast. I would decrease it upon news of a strategic partnership or better-than-expected sales momentum.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beyond Meat file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeyond Meat has had several years of losses and in the most recent quarter it [posted](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial) a loss from operations of almost $38 million.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Beyond Meat, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
