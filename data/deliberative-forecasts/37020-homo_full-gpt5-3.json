    "review": "Both forecasters add two useful cautions I underweighted: (1) correlated downside risk across categories if voters lean traditional this cycle, and (2) uncertainty about whether Malone is a credited songwriter on “I Had Some Help,” which would determine whether Song of the Year is a true path for him. They also flag the (still unresolved) 4 vs. 5 nomination count and the late-stage timing, implying limited scope for new positive signals. I agree with their read on category dynamics: Album is a long shot; Music Event and Single are the cleanest paths; Visual/Video is plausible; Song hinges on credit. I don’t find new affirmative evidence to push higher, and the correlation/credit points are convincing enough to shade down a bit from my prior.",
    "rationale": "My initial 70% leaned on multiple shots tied to a blockbuster hit and ACMs’ willingness to reward commercial moments, especially in Music Event and Single. After considering the others’ points, I’m trimming for two reasons: (a) correlated outcomes—if voters emphasize core-country credibility, several categories could simultaneously tilt away from Malone, and (b) real uncertainty about his songwriter credit, which could remove a path in Song of the Year. I still see a better-than-even chance because “I Had Some Help” provides strong avenues in Music Event and Single, with Visual Media as a secondary path, and Morgan Wallen’s presence likely increases acceptability among voters. But absent fresh buzz pointing to a frontrunner status in any category, the prudent move is a modest downgrade. Change: 70% -> 64%.",
