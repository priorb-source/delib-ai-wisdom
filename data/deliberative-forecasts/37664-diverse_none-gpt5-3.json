    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short timeline and lack of credible pre-launch signals as strong evidence against a near-term GA, and they stress the strict naming requirement (“Claude 4”) and non-waitlisted access. These are solid points. I had considered cadence and competitive pressure but underweighted the norm that major releases usually show telltale signs (docs/SDK references, press briefings, leaks) a few weeks out. Their argument that Anthropic might continue iterating on 3.x (or use a different name) is a meaningful downside factor I should lean into more. I still think a same-day surprise GA is possible given industry pace and Anthropic’s history of flipping access quickly on claude.ai, but it’s less likely than my prior implied.",
    "rationale": "Updating down primarily due to (1) absence of pre-announcement indicators this close to deadline, (2) the strict resolution requirement for the exact “Claude 4” name and public GA (no waitlist), and (3) plausible alternative paths (another 3.x iteration or different naming) that would resolve No. I keep a non-trivial probability for a June surprise launch driven by competitive dynamics and the plausible readiness window (~15 months post Claude 3), and because Anthropic has previously provided rapid general access for new models. Net effect: lower than my prior but not as low as 10–15%, reflecting a small but real chance of a mid-to-late June GA flip.",
