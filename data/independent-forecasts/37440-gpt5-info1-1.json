  "information": "Several bills concerning voter citizenship verification were considered in Florida's legislature. HB 831 would require state-issued IDs to indicate non-citizen status. HB 1381 would require voters to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport or birth certificate, for new or updated registrations. SB 1330 would require first-time voters to present similar documentation. The 2025 regular legislative session concluded without enacting these bills. A comprehensive bill containing similar provisions, CS/HB 1381, was withdrawn from consideration on May 3, 2025. An extended legislative session, constitutionally required to pass the state budget, began on May 12, 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No enactment",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The extended session that begins May 12 remains focused on the state budget and adjourns without taking up election/citizenship-verification policy. No subsequent special session is called (or the call does not include election laws). With no vehicle moving and little time for gubernatorial action, no qualifying bill is enacted before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Legislative leaders or the governor add an “election integrity/proof-of-citizenship” item to the extended session or call a June special session limited to elections. A bill like HB 1381/SB 1330 or HB 831 (or their language) advances quickly, passes both chambers, and the governor signs it before July 1 (or it becomes law without signature within the window).",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: The regular 2025 session ended without passing the proof-of-citizenship measures. CS/HB 1381 was withdrawn May 3, signaling low leadership priority or unresolved legal/policy concerns. In Florida, once sine die, new policy typically requires a special session or inclusion in an extended session’s agenda; neither is yet in place for this topic. World usually changes slowly; thus the status quo favors No.\n- Process/timing constraints: The extended session starting May 12 is constitutionally to finish the budget and is usually limited in scope; inserting non-budget election policy is atypical and could be procedurally challenged. A separate special session could be called, but that requires clear leadership intent and rapid turnaround to allow gubernatorial enactment before July 1. The governor’s 7–15 day action windows mean very late-June passage risks missing the July 1 deadline unless signed promptly.\n- Politics: Republicans control the governorship and both chambers, so if leadership prioritizes this, passage can be swift. National GOP pressure (including Trump’s advocacy) provides some incentive. The question’s bar is broad—any subset of voters or adjacent mechanisms (e.g., HB 831’s ID indicator) would count—so multiple policy paths could satisfy it. That said, the withdrawal of CS/HB 1381 and failure to pass in regular session suggest either legal caution (possible NVRA/federal-form conflicts per Arizona v. Inter Tribal Council) or competing priorities, reducing short-term odds.\n- Why not higher: Session ended without action; no public signal (yet) of adding this to the extended session or calling a special session; legal risk may deter a rushed push; time window is tight for both passage and enactment before July 1.\n- Why not lower: GOP trifecta allows fast movement if prioritized; leadership can expand a session call; the bar for a “Yes” is flexible (even partial/documentary requirements for a subset of voters, or ID notations) which increases the number of qualifying routes.\n- What would move me up: Any announcement that the extended session’s scope includes election/citizenship verification; a special session call on elections; new committee notices or filed committee substitutes resurrecting HB 1381/SB 1330/HB 831 language; public statements from the governor or presiding officers prioritizing this and aiming for June enactment.\n- What would move me down: Extended session adjourns without policy beyond the budget; leadership explicitly defers election-law changes to a later session; no relevant committee activity by mid-June; indications of intra-caucus/legal concerns stalling the idea.\n- Research assistant highlights: Multiple relevant bills (HB 831, HB 1381, SB 1330) existed; none enacted; CS/HB 1381 was withdrawn; extended session begins May 12 for the budget—these all weigh toward a lower probability within the remaining window.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral bills concerning voter citizenship verification were considered in Florida's legislature. HB 831 would require state-issued IDs to indicate non-citizen status. HB 1381 would require voters to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport or birth certificate, for new or updated registrations. SB 1330 would require first-time voters to present similar documentation. The 2025 regular legislative session concluded without enacting these bills. A comprehensive bill containing similar provisions, CS/HB 1381, was withdrawn from consideration on May 3, 2025. An extended legislative session, constitutionally required to pass the state budget, began on May 12, 2025.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
