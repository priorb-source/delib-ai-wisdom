    "review": "The two other forecasters arrived at nearly the identical conclusion as my own, with forecasts of 65% compared to my initial 68%. Their reasoning is highly consistent with my analysis, highlighting the same key factors: the strong downward pressure from breakeven WTI prices, negative industry sentiment from the Dallas Fed survey, and poor earnings from service companies, all balanced against the very narrow margin for the outcome to flip (a net decrease of only 3 rigs) and inherent weekly volatility. They did not raise any new evidence or arguments I hadn't considered. The primary value in their analyses is the strong consensus it reveals. The fact that two other experts independently landed on a slightly more conservative number gives me pause and suggests I may have slightly underweighting the impact of short-term randomness.",
    "rationale": "My core reasoning remains unchanged. The fundamental economic indicators—WTI crude prices near the ~$65 breakeven point, rising costs cited in the Dallas Fed survey, and declining North American revenues for service giants like Halliburton and Baker Hughes—all point toward a continued contraction or, at best, stagnation in drilling activity. The strong year-over-year downward trend further supports this directional view. A net decline of just three rigs over five weeks is a small change that aligns with these powerful headwinds. However, after reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am persuaded to slightly temper my confidence. Their consensus forecast of 65% highlights the significant role that short-term volatility can play when the starting point (585 rigs) is so close to the threshold (583). My initial 68% may have been slightly too confident in the fundamentals overriding this weekly noise. Therefore, I am making a small downward adjustment to my forecast to better reflect this uncertainty and align with the expert consensus. This is a minor calibration of confidence rather than a change in my overall thesis.",
