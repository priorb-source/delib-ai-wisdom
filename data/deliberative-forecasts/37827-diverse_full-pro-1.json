    "review": "The other two forecasters used a methodology nearly identical to my own, focusing on the historical base rate as the primary driver of the forecast. We all derived a similar monthly probability from the historical data of 4-6 pilot reports from Africa over ten years. Forecaster 3 introduced a more precise Poisson distribution model, which calculated the monthly probability range to be between 3.3% and 4.9%, confirming our initial ballpark estimates. I found their reasoning convincing as it reinforced my own analysis. However, I disagree with Forecaster 3's final probability of 6%. This figure is outside the range suggested by the historical data, and their justification seems to rest on overweighting a single pilot report from January 2025 as evidence of an upward trend, which I believe is insufficient evidence. Forecaster 2's analysis was very much in line with my own, landing at 5%, the top end of the calculated range.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I will not be changing my forecast. My initial assessment of 4% is strongly supported by the consensus methodology. The historical data points to 0.4-0.6 relevant reports per year. Using the more precise Poisson calculation shared by Forecaster 3, this annual rate (λ) translates to a monthly probability range of approximately 3.3% to 4.9%. My forecast of 4% sits directly in the middle of this data-driven range. The other forecasters did not present any new evidence suggesting a fundamental shift in reporting frequency. While we all noted the January 2025 pilot report from Rwanda, I maintain my position that this single event primarily serves to confirm that such reports are possible and get logged, rather than indicating a statistically significant increase in frequency for 2025. Therefore, I see no compelling reason to move to the upper bound (5%) or beyond it (6%), as this would imply that the future is more likely than the past to produce such a report, an assumption for which we lack sufficient evidence. My 4% forecast appropriately balances the demonstrated rarity of the event with its confirmed possibility.",
