  "information": "In Africa, a coup attempt in Burkina Faso was reportedly foiled on April 16, 2025, leading to the arrest of several army officers. This follows a January 2025 attack on the presidential palace in Chad, which was also viewed as a potential coup attempt. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has expressed concern over a wave of unconstitutional changes in West Africa, noting that between August 2020 and August 2024, the region experienced nine coup attempts, four of which were successful. Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso have withdrawn from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to form their own 'Sahel Alliance.' According to a report by Amnesty International, since the July 2023 coup in Niger, there has been a sharp escalation of human rights violations, including arbitrary detentions and violations of press freedom.\n\nAccording to the University of Illinois Cline Center’s Coup d'État Project, the number of coups, attempts, and conspiracies has risen since 2021 to 14-16 events per year, compared to single-digit figures in the 2000s and 2010s. However, these figures remain below the averages of the 1960s and 1970s. The number of successful coups was seven in 2021 and five in 2024. A summary of historical data from the reports indicates that from 2020 to early 2025, Africa experienced nine notable coup events, of which seven were successful. Over a similar period, from 2022 to 2024, Latin America had three notable coup events, all of which were unsuccessful.\n\nIn Latin America, the Venezuelan government has offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of opposition leader Edmundo González, accusing him of inciting a coup following a disputed election in 2024. In Brazil, former President Jair Bolsonaro is reportedly preparing to present legal arguments to defend himself against accusations of leading a coup plot. The World Bank has revised its economic growth projections for Latin America downward to 2.1% for 2025. According to the agents' analysis, there have been no reported coup attempts in Latin America so far in 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two months, as the question closes on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Given the short timeframe of just over two months, the most probable outcome is that no coup attempt successfully consolidates power, even though the political climate in some countries remains volatile.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The period until July 1, 2025, passes without a successful government overthrow. There may be political instability, protests, or even a foiled coup attempt in a country like Chad or Burkina Faso, but incumbent governments in Africa and Latin America maintain control of their state apparatus.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a politically unstable Sahelian country like Burkina Faso, Chad, or Mali, a faction of the military capitalizes on internal divisions, seizes the presidential palace and state media, and secures the allegiance of key military units. Within days, they establish effective control over the country with minimal resistance, which is then confirmed by credible international media reports.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the elevated base rate of successful coups in Africa since 2020, adjusted for the very short time remaining. The research indicates approximately 1.5 successful coups per year in Africa (7 successes between 2020 and early 2025). Over a two-month period (1/6th of a year), this base rate alone suggests a probability of around 25%. I am adjusting this slightly upward due to the acute and current instability in West and Central Africa. The recent foiled attempt in Burkina Faso (April 2025) and the incident in Chad (January 2025) demonstrate that coup plots are actively being planned and attempted in this high-risk region. The formation of the 'Sahel Alliance' by coup-led governments could also create a permissive environment for further unconstitutional changes. While Latin America has seen turmoil, particularly in Venezuela and Bolivia, recent coup attempts have failed, making its contribution to the overall probability minimal.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the timeframe is extremely short. Successful coups are significant, disruptive events that are inherently difficult to time precisely. A two-month window is narrow, and the status quo of no successful coup remains the most likely single outcome. \n\nMy forecast is not lower because ignoring the high-frequency signal of recent successful and attempted coups in Africa would be a mistake. The current environment is demonstrably more volatile than it was a decade ago, and the high success rate of recent African coups when they do occur (7 of 9 notable events) suggests that attempts have a strong chance of succeeding if they gain initial traction.\n\nI would increase my probability if credible reports emerged of a major military mutiny, a contested election result leading to a constitutional crisis in a high-risk country, or a significant internal power struggle within a ruling junta. I would decrease my probability if key leaders in at-risk nations successfully consolidated their power and purged potential rivals, or if regional bodies like ECOWAS or the African Union took unexpectedly effective preemptive action.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to [Powell & Thyne (2011, p. 252)](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf), a coup is \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\" In recent years, some of the coups in Africa have been:&#x20;\n\n* [Mali August 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Mali May 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Niger March 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Nigerien_coup_attempt) (attempt)\n* [Niger July 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nigerien_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Gabon August 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Gabonese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Chad January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%27Djamena_attack) (possible attempt)\n* [Burkina Faso January 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Burkina Faso September 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)&#x20;\n* [Guinea September 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n\nLatin America has had the following coup attempts in recent years:\n\n* [Peru self-coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Peruvian_self-coup_attempt), December 2022\n* [Brazil Congress attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack), January 2023\n* [Bolivia coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bolivian_coup_attempt), June 2024\n\nSee also: [VoA by the numbers Coups in Africa](https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is a successful coup d’état in any country on the African continent or Latin America before July 1, 2025, according to credible media reports. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nLatin America is defined as any country in North America or South America whose primary language is Spanish, Portuguese or French.\n\nA coup d’état (often shortened to \"coup\") is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) as an event in which a state's military or other components of its power structure overthrow the existing political authority.&#x20;\n\nA \"successful\" coup is defined as a coup in which the group or person attempting to seize power establishes control over both the government and military, and will be considered to have succeeded once any significant resistance to their authority has ceased.&#x20;\n\nA self-coup, [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup) as a political leader, having come to power through legal means, remaining in power through illegal means, will count. This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Africa, a coup attempt in Burkina Faso was reportedly foiled on April 16, 2025, leading to the arrest of several army officers.
