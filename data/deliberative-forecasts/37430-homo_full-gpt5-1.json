    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my initial take: House passage signals momentum; Senate passage plus assent is the remaining bottleneck; VAT exemption is relatively uncontroversial; but time and process risks are material. The new point I hadn’t weighted explicitly was the constitutional 30‑day assent window—if Senate passage slips to late June, enactment before July 1 isn’t guaranteed. They also raise the carve‑out option (fast‑tracking the VAT exemption in a separate bill), which would improve odds but lacks concrete signals so far. Overall, their reasoning is coherent and consistent with Nigerian legislative dynamics and typical slippage risks.",
    "rationale": "I remain slightly above even due to: (1) executive priority and a stated July 1 implementation date; (2) House passage already achieved; (3) the VAT exemption aligns with the administration’s affordability narrative and faces less opposition than revenue‑raising items. Offsetting risks: (a) tight calendar through June, including likely holiday recesses; (b) potential Senate amendments to the broader package that force harmonization; (c) labor‑union pushback on other provisions, which could slow the omnibus bill; and (d) the 30‑day presidential assent window, which bites if Senate passage is very late in June. I don’t see strong evidence that leadership will split out and fast‑track the VAT exemption yet. Given these factors, I’m shading my estimate down modestly from 68% to reflect the added timing risk if the Senate runs late, while keeping it above 50% on executive alignment and existing momentum.",
