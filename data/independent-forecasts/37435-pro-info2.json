  "information": "Competition from AI tools like ChatGPT has negatively impacted Chegg's core business model. In response, Chegg is introducing its own AI-powered features, such as 'Create' and 'Solution Scout'. In February 2025, the company filed a lawsuit against Google for unfair competition. Management is also undertaking a comprehensive strategic review, which includes considering privatization or acquisition as potential options. Furthermore, Chegg has initiated cost-cutting measures with the goal of achieving a 30% EBITDA margin and generating over $100 million in free cash flow by 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Chegg continues to operate, implementing its cost-cutting and AI-integration strategies while its strategic review continues, and does not file for bankruptcy.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Chegg's cost-cutting measures successfully stabilize its finances, preserving cash. The company continues its strategic review, potentially engaging in acquisition talks or focusing on the rollout of its new AI features. While its long-term future remains uncertain, its short-term liquidity is sufficient to avoid a bankruptcy filing before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, severe liquidity crisis forces the company's hand. This could be triggered by the strategic review concluding that no viable path forward or potential acquirer exists, combined with faster-than-expected erosion of its subscriber base, causing cash flow projections to be missed catastrophically. Alternatively, a major creditor could lose confidence and call a loan, forcing an emergency Chapter 11 filing to protect the company's assets.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored on the low base rate of publicly traded companies filing for bankruptcy within a very short, two-month timeframe. Bankruptcy is typically a protracted process, not an abrupt event, unless there is a sudden and catastrophic liquidity crisis.\n\nThe research indicates Chegg is actively taking steps to avoid this outcome. Management's stated goals of achieving a 30% EBITDA margin and generating over $100 million in free cash flow in 2025 strongly suggest the company does not anticipate an imminent cash shortage. A company generating significant free cash flow is the antithesis of one on the verge of bankruptcy. Furthermore, the ongoing strategic review, which includes options like privatization or acquisition, provides alternative pathways to a bankruptcy filing. These actions provide a significant buffer against a worst-case scenario in the short term.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because the competitive threat from AI is existential and the business environment is volatile. A sudden negative shock, such as the complete collapse of acquisition talks or a severe acceleration in customer churn, could theoretically trigger a rapid loss of stakeholder confidence and force a filing. The lawsuit against Google also introduces a small but unpredictable risk.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 5% because the company's proactive measures, especially its stated financial targets for 2025, make a bankruptcy filing in the next 56 days an extreme tail risk, not a probable outcome. They appear to have sufficient cash and strategic options to navigate the immediate future.\n\nI would increase my probability if there were news of a major credit downgrade, the abrupt departure of key executives, or an announcement that the strategic review has failed to find a buyer. I would decrease my probability upon the announcement of a sale of the company or news that their new AI products are successfully stabilizing revenue.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chegg file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWall Street Journal: [How ChatGPT Brought Down an Online Education Giant](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-chatgpt-brought-down-an-online-education-giant-200b4ff2)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Chegg, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nCompetition from AI tools like ChatGPT has negatively impacted Chegg's core business model.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
