  "information": "According to Taiwo Oyedele, the Chairman of the Presidential Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms, the proposed Tax Reform Bill includes a provision to exempt real estate transactions from Value Added Tax (VAT). Official statements indicate the bill also contains exemptions on stamp duties for rents below N10 million per month and capital gains tax on the sale of dwelling houses. The stated purpose of these reforms is to reduce the tax burden on the construction and real estate sectors, thereby lowering housing costs and improving affordability for low-income earners.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (≈8 weeks)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — legislation typically takes longer than two months to pass both chambers and receive presidential assent, especially mid-year and outside the usual Finance Act cycle.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Tax Reform Bill stalls in committee or only passes one chamber before late June; or it becomes bundled into a broader fiscal package targeted for passage with the 2026 budget cycle, slipping past July 1. Alternatively, the government opts for administrative guidance (e.g., an FIRS circular) rather than an act of the National Assembly, which wouldn’t satisfy the “legislation enacted” criterion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The executive-backed Tax Reform Bill is prioritized and fast-tracked, clearing both the House and Senate in June with the VAT exemption for real estate intact, followed by prompt presidential assent before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and context: The Presidential Committee on Fiscal Policy and Tax Reforms (PCFPTR), chaired by Taiwo Oyedele, has publicly said the Tax Reform Bill includes an exemption of real estate transactions from VAT, along with other housing-friendly measures. Reports in late April 2025 indicate the bill is before the National Assembly. This shows real intent and a concrete legislative vehicle.\n- Timing and base rates: Only ~8 weeks remain. Nigerian tax changes of this scope often pass as part of year-end Finance Acts aligned with the budget. Mid-year passage is possible for priority executive bills but less common. The National Assembly may also lose sitting days to the June Eid al-Adha recess, tightening the window for committee work, harmonization, final votes, and presidential assent.\n- Political and fiscal constraints: The administration aims to raise the tax-to-GDP ratio; broadening the base while offering targeted relief is the stated strategy. A VAT exemption for real estate could face resistance due to revenue implications for the federation and states. That risk, plus the bill’s broader scope, can slow the process or invite amendments that delay passage.\n- Criteria sensitivity: The question requires legislation enacted, not just policy statements or regulatory guidance. Even if the government signals the change or FIRS issues a circular, it won’t resolve Yes without an enacted act.\n- Why not higher: Short runway, potential recess, multi-item bill that can bog down, and fiscal pushback make quick enactment uncertain.\n- Why not lower: It is an executive-backed reform with visible political signaling around housing affordability. If leadership prioritizes it, the National Assembly can move quickly, and the President can assent promptly.\n- Update triggers upward: (1) Committee reports scheduled with a timeline indicating passage in June; (2) one chamber passes the bill with the VAT exemption intact; (3) public statements from NASS leadership labeling it a priority with fast-track procedures; (4) harmonization between chambers completed before mid-June.\n- Update triggers downward: (1) Reports of the bill being split or deferred to the Finance Act cycle; (2) substantive opposition from key committees, governors, or FIRS on revenue grounds; (3) indications that the exemption will be handled via regulation rather than statute; (4) legislative calendar constraints pushing votes into July or later.\n- Research assistant summary: The RA notes the bill includes VAT exemption for real estate, reduced stamp duties on lower rents, and CGT relief for dwelling sales, framed as measures to ease housing costs—evidence of intent but not of enactment or stage completion.\nOverall, the status quo favors No, but a government push could still deliver a late-June enactment.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Nigeria enact legislation exempting real estate transactions from VAT before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[FG: Tax reform bill to exempt real estate transactions from VAT, boost housing affordability in Nigeria](https://nairametrics.com/2025/04/25/fg-tax-reform-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat-boost-housing-affordability-in-nigeria/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
