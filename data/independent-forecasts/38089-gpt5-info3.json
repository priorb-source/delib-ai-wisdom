  "information": "Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has initiated work on a new constitution, appointing a team of legal experts to draft it. Erdoğan stated the current constitution is outdated, while critics raised concerns the move could be intended to extend his presidency beyond 2028, a claim he has denied. Erdoğan also ruled out early elections. In foreign affairs, he publicly criticized Pedro Sánchez for showing support for the detained Istanbul Mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu. The two leaders met in Istanbul in May 2025 to discuss bilateral relations, including trade, security, and the situation in Gaza.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Morning Consult has typically shown Erdoğan’s approval above Sánchez’s, and ties resolve to No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Through late June, Erdoğan remains in the low-to-mid 40s approval while Sánchez stays in the low-to-mid 30s; even a tie would still resolve No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A negative shock in Turkey (e.g., economic setback, political controversy escalating around the constitution) pushes Erdoğan’s approval into the mid-30s or lower while Sánchez gets a late-June bump (e.g., domestic policy win or positive economic news) lifting him to the upper 30s or ~40, leaving Sánchez higher on July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Morning Consult’s tracker in recent months has generally shown Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s raw approval in the low-to-mid 40s and Pedro Sánchez’s in the low-to-mid 30s. That gap (roughly ~8–12 points) has been persistent across 2024–early 2025. With only ~1 month to go and the tracker being a 7-day moving average, large swings are unlikely.\n\nAssistant’s notes: Erdoğan has initiated work on a new constitution (denying the aim is term extension) and ruled out early elections; he criticized Sánchez over İmamoğlu, and they met in May to discuss bilateral issues and Gaza. None of this obviously implies a sharp, near-term reordering of their approval levels. In Turkey, inflation remains a key driver; while the economic adjustment could either erode or gradually stabilize approval, abrupt, multi-point drops over a few weeks are not common absent major shocks. In Spain, Sánchez’s approval has been capped by domestic polarization (e.g., amnesty controversy) despite solid macro indicators; quick, large gains are rare among Western European leaders in this tracker.\n\nWhy not higher: The status quo strongly favors No; ties resolve No; and the time window is short for Sánchez to overtake Erdoğan by several points. Why not lower: Turkey’s approval can be more volatile than Spain’s; a sudden economic or political flare-up in Turkey could dent Erdoğan’s approval, and a well-timed positive development in Spain could lift Sánchez a few points.\n\nWhat would move me up: Early-to-mid June Morning Consult updates showing Erdoğan sliding to ≤38% and/or Sánchez rising to ≥38–40%; a clear, widely covered negative shock for Erdoğan; or a high-salience win for Sánchez. What would move me down: Fresh readings keeping Erdoğan steady around 43–47% and Sánchez at ~30–35%, or positive Turkish macro news reducing consumer pain.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Pedro Sánchez has a higher approval rating than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has initiated work on a new constitution, appointing a team of legal experts to draft it.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
