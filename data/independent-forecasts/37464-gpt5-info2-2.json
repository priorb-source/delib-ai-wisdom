  "information": "The recalled chicken Caesar wraps were distributed to vending machines located in office buildings within the state of Washington. The labeling issue was discovered by the company during a routine quality assurance check of ingredient labels. As of early May 2025, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions or illnesses due to the consumption of these products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has urged consumers and offices not to consume or serve the products and to either return them or dispose of them.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 23 days (until May 31, 2025, inclusive)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall remains listed as Active on the FSIS page on/after June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS effectiveness checks and paperwork (e.g., product accounting/disposition from vending operators) take longer than expected, or the agency’s administrative update lags into early June; the page still shows Active on or after June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "LPK1 provides satisfactory documentation that all affected wraps are accounted for or expired and removed, FSIS completes effectiveness checks, and the agency updates the recall status to Closed during May.",
    "rationale": "Baseline considerations: We are ~10 weeks post-initiation (Feb 24 → May 8) with ~3 weeks left to reach June 1. Many small, limited-scope FSIS recalls for misbranding/undeclared allergens close within roughly 1–3 months once effectiveness checks and product disposition are verified. The product here is a short-shelf-life, ready-to-eat wrap distributed only to vending machines in Washington state, discovered via the company’s QA process, and there are no reported illnesses. Those features generally support quicker closure. \n\nStatus quo weighting: As of early May, the recall is still Active. Government status changes sometimes lag, and FSIS occasionally takes several months to close even straightforward allergen recalls, particularly if documentation from downstream distributors/operators is slow or if the agency prioritizes higher-risk, widely distributed recalls. If nothing changes administratively before June 1, the resolution is No.\n\nWhy not higher: (1) Administrative lag risk — the page must show Closed before June 1; even if the recall is effectively over, the status update might slip into June. (2) Allergen recalls are often Class I, prompting thorough effectiveness verification. (3) The vending-machine supply chain could involve multiple operators, slowing complete accounting.\n\nWhy not lower: (1) Distribution appears narrow (office-building vending machines in one state), making product recovery/verification easier. (2) Very perishable product; by May, affected lots should be expired and removed, simplifying closure. (3) Initiated by the firm (QA discovery) with no illnesses reported, which typically correlates with smoother, quicker closure. (4) We are approaching ~95 days by end of May, within a common closure window for limited recalls.\n\nWhat would update me upward: Evidence the FSIS page shows ongoing effectiveness checks nearing completion; a company/FSIS update indicating all product accounted for; or any indication other recent similar FSIS allergen recalls from early March closed within ~60–90 days.\n\nWhat would update me downward: Any recall expansion, additional distribution discovered, difficulty contacting all vending operators, or lack of FSIS updates into the final week of May (suggesting an early-June administrative change at best).\n\nResearch assistant inputs used: Limited distribution (WA vending machines), discovered via routine QA, and no illness reports — all factors supporting the plausibility of a timely closure within the next few weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe recalled chicken Caesar wraps were distributed to vending machines located in office buildings within the state of Washington. The labeling issue was discovered by the company during a routine quality assurance check of ingredient labels. As of early May 2025, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions or illnesses due to the consumption of these products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has urged consumers and offices not to consume or serve the products and to either return them or dispose of them.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
