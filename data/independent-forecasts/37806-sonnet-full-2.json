  "information": "A legislative proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Mike Collins, seeks to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery program. The act would also prevent visa lottery winners from sponsoring family members for permanent residence. The proposal has received support from conservative organizations such as Heritage Action and NumbersUSA, which argue that the program undermines national security and lacks a merit-based selection process. President Trump previously called on Congress to terminate the program in 2017, following a terrorist attack in New York committed by an individual who had entered the U.S. through the visa lottery.\n\nSince taking office in January 2025, the Trump administration has taken numerous actions on immigration. As of February 17, 2025, the administration had issued 62 executive orders, including ones to end Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates, an order to end birthright citizenship for children of unauthorized immigrants, and a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border. Other relevant policies implemented include a new rule requiring non-citizens to carry proof of legal status at all times, visa restrictions on Indian travel agencies accused of facilitating illegal immigration, and a policy to limit visas for foreign officials who facilitate irregular migration.\n\nThe Diversity Visa program, which grants up to 55,000 visas annually, has continued to operate. The results for the 2025 lottery were scheduled for release on May 3, 2025, with the application period for the 2027 lottery set to open in October 2025. Of the more than 40 presidential actions issued since January 2025, none have contained the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa.' The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website has not posted any official notice of the program's cancellation. Legal analyses mentioned in reports suggest that since the program is established by statute, substantial changes would typically require new legislation passed by Congress.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 42 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Despite the Trump administration's extensive immigration activity with 62+ executive orders issued through mid-February 2025, none have contained the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa'",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration continues pursuing immigration priorities through other channels. The SAFE for America Act proceeds through Congress as the preferred vehicle for eliminating the program. Any administrative actions related to the Diversity Visa program use alternative terminology (e.g., 'visa lottery program') or the administration simply doesn't prioritize issuing a specific presidential action on this topic before July 1st. The program continues operating with the 2025 lottery results released and 2027 application period proceeding as scheduled.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "President Trump issues an executive order, presidential memorandum, or proclamation that specifically addresses the Diversity Visa program using those exact words. This could be framed as supporting the congressional SAFE Act, directing agencies to prepare for the program's wind-down, suspending certain aspects within executive authority, or making a policy statement about the program. The timing could align with the release of 2025 lottery results in early May or the lead-up to the 2027 application period in October.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly suggests a No outcome. Despite Trump's well-documented opposition to the Diversity Visa program (calling for its termination in 2017) and the administration's hyperactive approach to immigration policy with 62+ executive orders issued by mid-February, not one has used the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' through May 20. This 4+ month track record is highly informative.\n\nSeveral factors keep the probability from being higher: (1) The program is established by statute, limiting what executive action can accomplish and potentially making the administration prefer Congressional action via the SAFE Act; (2) The administration has focused executive actions on areas with clearer executive authority (border emergency, enforcement priorities, DEI mandates, birthright citizenship); (3) The exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' is required - they could reference the program as 'visa lottery program' or other terminology, which wouldn't count; (4) The strong status quo of non-mention over 4+ months suggests this isn't a top priority for presidential action.\n\nFactors preventing the probability from being even lower: (1) Trump holds strong views on this program and has administrative capacity to issue such an action; (2) Six weeks remains, which is sufficient time; (3) Legislative momentum from the SAFE Act could prompt a supportive presidential statement or directive; (4) The administration has shown willingness to use executive authority broadly even in legally questionable areas; (5) Recent events (May 3 lottery results release, October application period approaching) could serve as catalytic moments.\n\nFor me to update higher, I'd need to see: signals that Trump plans to address this specifically, White House statements using the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa,' or draft orders being discussed. To update lower, I'd need: the July deadline approaching without action, clear statements that they're pursuing only legislative solutions, or focus shifting to other immigration priorities.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA legislative proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Mike Collins, seeks to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery program.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
