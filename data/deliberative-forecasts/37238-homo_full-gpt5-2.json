    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base-rate and proximity logic. Two useful additions: (1) a concrete counterexample that Trump skipped Newark’s UFC 302 in 2024, suggesting Newark isn’t a special draw by itself; (2) the early-June calendar risk (e.g., D‑Day commemorations or other official travel) that could preclude a June 7 evening appearance. I agree with their emphasis that recent attendance at 314 makes a second appearance within ~8 weeks less typical. No new hard evidence (schedule leaks, Dana White hints) emerged to push the probability up. Overall, their arguments are credible and nudge me slightly downward from my prior.",
    "rationale": "Core factors remain: the base rate for any one UFC card is below 50%; Newark proximity to Bedminster lowers friction; Trump–Dana White relationship and the O’Malley headliner add media value; but attending again so soon after UFC 314 is atypical, and early‑June official obligations could conflict. The added Newark-302 datapoint and the D‑Day/travel reminder modestly reduce my estimate from 45%. I’d move up on credible schedule indications he’ll be in Bedminster/NYC that weekend or hints from White/UFC; I’d move down on confirmed out‑of‑area travel or an evening commitment elsewhere on June 7.",
