    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I had underweighted. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the 6.5-week timeframe being 'insufficient time for major approval rating shifts absent major crises' is particularly persuasive. Forecaster 3's point that honeymoon periods typically last 3-6 months, and we're asking about a resolution date only 9 weeks post-election, strengthens the structural case for Yes. Both correctly note that Trump's approval has a historical ceiling in the low-to-mid 40s, which I had mentioned but perhaps didn't emphasize enough relative to the honeymoon boost new leaders receive. However, I notice all three of us share a critical limitation: we lack actual current Morning Consult baseline data for either leader. We're extrapolating from March pre-election polling for Carney and historical patterns for Trump. The Morning Consult methodology may differ from general polling in ways we can't predict. Additionally, while the honeymoon effect is real, Carney faces immediate challenges - unresolved tariffs, a $62.3B projected deficit, and no budget before summer - that could accelerate any decline. The 77% Canadian disapproval of Trump is helpful context but doesn't directly tell us Carney's approval trajectory.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, I'm persuaded to update higher primarily due to the timeframe argument. Six and a half weeks is genuinely very short for significant political momentum shifts. The combination of: (1) Carney being only 9 weeks post-election victory at resolution date, (2) honeymoon periods typically lasting 3-6 months, (3) Trump's historically constrained approval ceiling, and (4) the structural anti-Trump sentiment in Canada (77% negative view) creates a strong baseline case. However, I'm not updating all the way to 70-72% because: (1) we lack current Morning Consult baseline data, which is our actual resolution source, (2) polling methodology variations can be significant, (3) the tariff situation remains unresolved and could create faster-than-expected economic pain, and (4) Carney's deficit projections could become controversial even within a short timeframe. The forecasters are right that I was too conservative about the honeymoon effect's durability over such a short period, but I want to maintain some uncertainty given our data limitations.",
