    "review": "Both forecasters largely echo my priors: multiple bottom-tier competitors dilute any single team’s chance; short horizon variance matters but is bounded; and without current standings, the status quo leans No. New, useful nuances: (1) the “on or after June 15” check adds small extra randomness, and (2) a clear base-rate framing (3.3% random-team baseline, then adjusted upward for Rockies’ poor true talent). Neither provides hard new data on current standings, but Forecaster 3’s emphasis on an equal-share among a 4–6 team cellar cluster nudges me slightly lower than my initial point. Forecaster 2’s range (15–30%) aligns with my earlier 22% and supports staying in the low-20s absent evidence the Rockies are already in sole last.",
    "rationale": "We’re ~4 weeks out. Colorado is a credible bottom-tier team, but there are several similarly weak clubs (e.g., White Sox, A’s, Marlins, Angels, Nationals). With 65–70 games played by mid-June, 1–3 wins often separate the bottom cluster; being the single worst on a specific date typically falls in the mid-teens to mid-20s for any one candidate unless they already hold a clear deficit. The check “on or after” June 15 injects a bit of extra noise that slightly tempers confidence. Ties for worst winning percentage likely count, which mildly boosts the chance. Netting these considerations—and lacking current-standings conditioning—I trim slightly from 22% to 20% to reflect the status quo bias toward another team already being worst and the timing nuance. If evidence surfaces that Colorado is currently in sole last or within ~1 game of last, I’d move to ~28–40%; if they’re ≥2 games better than the current worst, I’d drop to ~10–15%.",
