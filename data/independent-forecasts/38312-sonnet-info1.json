  "information": "As of early June 2025, India has not received an official invitation to the G7 summit scheduled to take place in Canada from June 15-17. Multiple media outlets, including The Tribune and the Hindustan Times, have reported this, citing official sources. These reports indicate that no advance preparations for a high-level visit from India are underway. This is contrary to the protocol for such trips, which are typically planned weeks in advance for security and logistical coordination. Canada has extended invitations to other non-G7 countries, including Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "12-14 days until the G7 Summit begins on June 15, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - India has not received an invitation and no preparations are underway",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Canada does not extend an invitation to India before the summit, or extends a very late invitation that Modi declines or cannot logistically attend given the short timeframe and lack of security/logistics preparation",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Canada extends a last-minute invitation to India within the next few days, Modi accepts, and both countries expedite the typically week-long security and logistical planning process to enable his attendance",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly indicates a NO outcome. As of June 3, with the summit only 12-14 days away, India has not received an invitation according to multiple credible media sources (Times of India, The Tribune, Hindustan Times). This is particularly significant because: (1) High-level international visits typically require weeks of advance planning for security coordination and logistics; (2) Canada has already extended invitations to other non-G7 countries including Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil, suggesting the invitation list may be finalized; (3) Official sources confirm no advance preparations are underway in India for such a visit. For a YES outcome, Canada would need to issue an invitation within days, Modi would need to accept, and both countries would need to drastically compress the normal security and diplomatic preparation timeline - highly irregular for a summit of this importance. I'm not forecasting lower (near 0%) because diplomatic situations can occasionally change rapidly, and a last-minute political decision to invite India remains theoretically possible, though unprecedented and logistically challenging. I'm not forecasting higher because the combination of no invitation yet, extremely limited time remaining, and completed invitations to other non-G7 countries makes Modi's attendance highly improbable. I would update upward only upon news of an actual invitation being extended to India.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill India's PM Narendra Modi attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of India: [Canada invites Australia, Ukraine for G7 meet but no call for India yet](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-invites-australia-ukraine-for-g7-meet-but-no-call-for-india-yet/articleshow/121398906.cms)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early June 2025, India has not received an official invitation to the G7 summit scheduled to take place in Canada from June 15-17.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
