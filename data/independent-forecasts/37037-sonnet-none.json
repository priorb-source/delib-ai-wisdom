    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "39 days, from April 23, 2025 to June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Based on the AP article indicating Lesotho currently has the highest US tariffs in the world, it appears the 50% tariff is likely already in place and would remain so if nothing changes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US government reduces or eliminates the 50% tariff on Lesotho before June 1, 2025, either through bilateral negotiations, a policy reversal by the administration, or as part of a broader trade policy adjustment",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current 50% tariff remains in place through June 1, 2025, or if not currently at exactly 50%, it is adjusted to that level before the resolution date. The resolution criteria specify that suspended status does not affect resolution, so even a suspended 50% tariff would count as Yes",
    "rationale": "The AP article headline stating Lesotho has 'the highest US tariffs in the world' strongly suggests that an unusually high tariff rate is already in effect, likely at or very close to 50%. With only 5-6 weeks until the resolution date, there is limited time for significant policy changes. Status quo bias is particularly strong here - trade policy changes typically require deliberation, negotiation, and implementation time. The Trump administration's tariff policies have been consequential but even rapid policy shifts need some lead time. The phrase 'how tiny Lesotho ended up with' suggests this is an already-established situation rather than a future possibility. However, I cannot assign probability above 80% because: (1) I lack confirmation of the exact current tariff rate, (2) the unusual specificity of exactly 50% creates some uncertainty, (3) the current administration has shown willingness to make rapid policy changes, and (4) there could be behind-the-scenes negotiations or reviews underway. The question's note that suspended status doesn't affect resolution suggests some complexity in how these tariffs are recorded. For me to update higher, I would need confirmation that the tariff is currently listed at exactly 50% with no active policy review. For me to update lower, I would need evidence of active negotiations with Lesotho, announced tariff reviews, or political pressure for changes",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Lesotho as 50% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [How tiny Lesotho ended up with the highest US tariffs in the world](https://apnews.com/article/lesotho-us-trump-tariffs-b337efa47290e889aa076cc9ede7bc9d)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 50% for Lesotho at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=lesotho) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
