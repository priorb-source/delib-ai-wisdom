    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly (18%, 20%, 25%), suggesting convergent reasoning. Forecaster 2 makes the most valuable contribution by explicitly estimating a base rate (2-6 African pilot reports per year to NUFORC) and deriving monthly probability (15-40%). This structured approach validates our intuitive estimates. Using Poisson distribution math: if λ=0.17-0.5 reports/month, P(≥1 report) = 16-39%, which brackets all our forecasts nicely. Forecaster 3's reasoning closely mirrors mine at 18%. The key insight is that having observed the Rwanda report just 5 months ago (January 2025) provides stronger evidence than I initially weighted - it suggests the base rate may be toward the higher end of plausible estimates. However, all forecasters appropriately noted we're working with very limited data, and the Rwanda example could be an outlier. The mathematical framing from Forecaster 2 doesn't introduce fundamentally new information but does provide useful validation that our intuitive estimates align with a structured probabilistic approach.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I find my original 20% forecast well-calibrated and sitting appropriately in the middle of the clustered estimates. Forecaster 2's explicit base rate methodology (2-6 reports/year → 15-40% monthly probability) confirms my reasoning rather than challenging it. The January 2025 Rwanda example remains the critical data point - its recent occurrence (just 5 months ago) suggests the phenomenon isn't extremely rare, supporting probabilities in our 18-25% range rather than single digits. However, I'm not moving my forecast upward to 25% because: (1) the base rate of 2-6 per year is itself speculative with high uncertainty; (2) reporting patterns may have temporal clustering or seasonal effects we don't understand; (3) the multiple constraints (pilot + Africa + June + NUFORC reporting) remain highly restrictive. My 20% appropriately balances the proof-of-concept evidence against the constraint multiplicity and data limitations. The tight clustering of independent forecasts (18-25%) also suggests we've identified the reasonable probability range.",
