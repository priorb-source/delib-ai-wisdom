    "review": "Both forecasters made a useful explicit decomposition: Pr(fight happens) × Pr(Merab wins | fight). That framing clarifies how cancellation/NC risk meaningfully drags the headline probability under this question’s rules. Their chosen figures (≈90% fight-go; ≈72% conditional for Merab) are consistent with the prior head-to-head, style matchup, and the known health context. They also explicitly priced small draw/NC probability. No major new factual inputs beyond my prior, but the structured breakdown and explicit accounting for draw/NC marginally strengthen the case for a slightly higher conditional win rate than I had implicitly used.",
    "rationale": "I’ll adopt an explicit breakdown. With ~12 days remaining, I put fight-go at ~90% given minor camp injuries for Merab and O’Malley’s post-surgery status but no strong signals of withdrawal. Conditional on the fight, Merab’s prior UD win, relentless wrestling/pace, and recent title defense vs. Umar support a 70–72% edge over five rounds. O’Malley’s KO/counter equity and possible improvements post-hip surgery keep that from being higher, and there’s some uncertainty around Merab’s minor injuries. Including a small draw/NC slice, I land near the peers’ range. Calculation: 0.90 × 0.71 ≈ 0.64. That’s a modest uptick from my 62% to reflect the clearer decomposition and a slightly higher conditional for Merab, while still respecting O’Malley’s finishing threat and late event-risk.",
