    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the core point I made: with ~3.5 weeks left and no pre-launch smoke (staffing, venue, filings, donor chatter), the base case is No. New/useful additions: (1) Florida’s political committee environment reduces the need to formally announce to raise money, weakening the Q2-EOQ impetus; (2) 12–18 months out is a plausible window for 2026 gubernatorial launches, so June isn’t too early, which keeps a non-trivial Yes probability. I find the PC point particularly persuasive as a reason to shade down slightly. The argument for keeping some probability (EOQ/Q2, open seat positioning) is valid but less diagnostic without corroborating signals.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is short, and the absence of typical pre-launch indicators materially lowers the likelihood of an imminent announcement. While a mid-2025 launch is plausible for 2026 and a pre–June 30 debut could provide a clean fundraising narrative, Florida’s ability to raise and organize via political committees diminishes the necessity of a formal declaration this month. Suarez’s prior presidential misfire also points to a more cautious rollout. Net: I trim my estimate slightly to reflect the Florida PC dynamic while preserving a meaningful chance for a late-June move if signals emerge quickly.",
