    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my priors: long hiatus, short remaining window, and lack of imminent-test signals keep odds low but not negligible. New/useful emphasis from Forecaster 2 is the point that even a willing regime’s preparations (cabling, portal sealing, perimeter lockdown) typically leak via commercial satellite or allied warnings, which weighs further against a near-term surprise. Forecaster 3 adds that there’s no strong seasonal/timing pattern favoring May–June beyond isolated historical cases, reinforcing a low baseline for this specific window. I find their reasoning generally convincing and consistent with observed patterns; neither presents evidence of fresh signals that would push the probability up.",
    "rationale": "I slightly adjust down: the combination of a 61-day horizon and the historical tendency for pre-test steps to be externally detectable suggests we’d likely see warning indicators first; in their absence, the hazard over this short window is modest. Countervailing factors (maintained site readiness since 2022, Russia/China dynamics potentially lowering costs, and possible desire to validate compact/tactical designs) justify staying above very low single digits. I reduce from 10% to 9% to reflect the added weight on the detectability-of-preparations argument without any new escalation trigger identified.",
