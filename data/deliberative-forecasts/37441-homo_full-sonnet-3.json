    "review": "All three forecasters converge on remarkably similar analyses, identifying the same core challenge: a 9.5% USD depreciation in approximately 8 weeks would be extraordinarily rapid for a major currency pair without a crisis. Forecaster 2's emphasis on needing a 'crisis-level event' is a useful framing that I had implicitly considered but not explicitly stated. Forecaster 3's emphasis on 'status quo bias' and 'the world changes slowly' is also valuable framing. However, no fundamentally new information or arguments were presented that I hadn't already weighed. The convergence around similar reasoning (same data points, same bull/bear factors, same concerns about magnitude and timing) is actually reassuring rather than reason to update. The narrow forecast range of 12-18% suggests we're all appropriately calibrated on this being a low-probability but non-negligible event.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I maintain my assessment that 18% is appropriate. While Forecaster 2's lower 12% emphasizes the crisis-level nature of the required move, I believe this underweights the current setup: (1) the dollar already has significant downward momentum (7% YTD decline), (2) the trajectory from 0.884 to 0.80 is directionally aligned with existing trends, not a reversal, (3) multiple risk factors remain unresolved (trade policy, Fed policy uncertainty, Q1 contraction), and (4) technical analysts do see 1.25 EUR/USD as plausible for 2025. The fact that Forecaster 3 independently arrived at 18% through similar reasoning validates this calibration. The 9.5% move is indeed large and unlikely, but it's not so extreme as to warrant single-digit probability given the existing bearish setup. A true crisis-level event would push USD far beyond 0.80 EUR; reaching exactly 0.80 could occur through an acceleration of existing trends rather than requiring a completely new crisis. The balance between respecting base rates of large currency moves while acknowledging the current momentum and uncertainties is best captured at 18%.",
