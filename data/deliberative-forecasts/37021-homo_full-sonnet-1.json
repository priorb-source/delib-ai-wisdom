    "review": "All three analyses converge remarkably on the same evidence and reasoning, with forecasts ranging only from 72-78%. This narrow range suggests robust agreement on the fundamental picture: Ukraine is 0.4 percentage points away from 15.0% with clear accelerating momentum, the NBU explicitly expects a Q2 peak, and structural pressures remain intense. No forecaster introduced materially new information that changes the calculus. Forecaster 2's 78% and Forecaster 3's 72% bracket my 77%, with all three citing identical supporting evidence (acceleration trend, NBU Q2 peak forecast, food/housing price pressures) and similar counterarguments (NBU policy, seasonal factors, demand weakness). The convergence on ~75% probability suggests we've correctly identified the key dynamics. One timing consideration I emphasized but others didn't stress as much: we're already on April 22nd, meaning roughly three-quarters of the month has passed under the same conditions that produced March's 14.6%. This reduces the window for unexpected reversals and slightly strengthens the case for crossing 15%.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find no compelling reason for a significant update. We all identified the same core dynamics: strong accelerating momentum from 12.9% to 14.6%, proximity to the 15.0% threshold (just 0.4 points away), the NBU's explicit Q2 peak forecast, and sustained structural pressures from war-related disruptions. The main uncertainty revolves around whether disinflationary forces (tight monetary policy, seasonal crop improvements, weak demand) could materialize quickly enough to prevent crossing 15% in April's remaining days. Given that it's already April 22nd with no signs of sudden reversal, the status quo strongly favors a 'Yes' outcome. However, I maintain some caution (not going to 85%+) because: (1) economic data can have volatility and measurement quirks, (2) we don't yet have hard April data, and (3) seasonal effects could potentially arrive earlier than the NBU's 'summer' timeline suggests. The intersubjective agreement around 72-78% reinforces confidence in this probability range. I'll maintain my forecast at 77%, which sits appropriately in the middle of the three estimates.",
