    "review": "Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the long silence since the 2022 report is a meaningful negative signal I hadn’t weighted explicitly enough. Their point about the typical pre-signing “crescendo” of leaks and high-level meetings is well-taken and consistent with past K9 deals. Forecaster 3 adds a useful reminder that the resolution bar is only 2+ units, which marginally raises the chance of a smaller, pilot-style announcement; however, governments rarely publicize very small SPH buys unless embedded in a broader package, so I don’t find that pushes the odds as high as 40%. Overall, Forecaster 2’s caution on the absence of chatter and tight timeline is more persuasive than the upside from the low threshold highlighted by Forecaster 3.",
    "rationale": "Key facts remain: (1) a credible 2022 report of negotiations for ~20 K9s, (2) no corroborating follow-up or recent signals, and (3) fewer than two months to deadline. The long information vacuum is a strong negative indicator for an imminent government-announced agreement, especially for a first-of-its-kind sale where political, financing, training, and sustainment issues are non-trivial. While the resolution threshold is low (2+ units), such a minimal quantity announcement is atypical and may not be politically salient enough to rush out on this timeline. Meanwhile, there are no obvious near-term diplomatic events before July 1 that would naturally host a signing. Countervailing factors keeping the probability non-trivial include Vietnam’s strategic diversification incentives, South Korea’s active push for K9 exports, and the possibility of a quiet, sudden announcement via DAPA or a ministerial press release. Balancing these, I modestly lower my forecast from 32% to 29%, giving greater weight to the prolonged lack of “chatter” and the short fuse to the deadline.",
