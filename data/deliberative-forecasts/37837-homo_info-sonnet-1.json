    "review": "Both forecasters make reasonable arguments based on the 50-year historical average of ~300 reports per month, but they explicitly acknowledge lacking access to specific recent data. Forecaster 2 states 'without access to specific recent June data from NUFORC' and Forecaster 3 notes 'I lack specific data on recent monthly reporting rates.' This is the critical gap. My research assistant provided concrete recent data showing: (1) June exceeded 400 in three of the last four years (2020: 470, 2021: 407, 2022: 603), (2) all months in 2023 exceeded 600, (3) all months in 2024 exceeded 450, and (4) the first four months of 2025 averaged 517. This recent data paints a dramatically different picture than the 50-year average. The reporting rate has clearly increased substantially in recent years, likely due to increased UAP legitimacy, improved online reporting, and sustained media attention. Their mentions of June being peak season and the Contact in the Desert conference are valid but minor considerations already reflected in the historical June data. Their forecasts of 58% and 38% would be appropriate IF we only had the long-term average, but the specific recent trend data fundamentally changes the analysis.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm confident in maintaining my forecast. The key differentiator is data quality and recency. While they're working from a 50-year average suggesting ~300 reports per month, I have specific recent data showing: every month in 2023 exceeded 600, every month in 2024 exceeded 450, and early 2025 is averaging 517 - well above the 400 threshold. More specifically for June: it exceeded 400 in 2020, 2021, and 2022. This isn't speculation about seasonal effects or historical averages - it's direct evidence of a strong upward trend that has been remarkably consistent for over two years. For June 2025 to fail to exceed 400 would require a sudden reversal of a pattern that has held for every single month since at least 2023. The other forecasters' uncertainty makes sense given their data limitations, but I have better information. I considered whether I'm being overconfident, but the trend is simply too strong and consistent to ignore. The only reason I'm not at 90%+ is to maintain appropriate humility about unforeseen events and the fact we don't yet have May 2025 data. But 87% appropriately reflects high confidence based on overwhelming recent evidence.",
