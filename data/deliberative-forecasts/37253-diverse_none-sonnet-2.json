    "review": "The other forecasters raised several important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2 provided crucial information that U.S. and South Korean intelligence have assessed for over two years that North Korea has completed preparations at Punggye-ri and could test with little warning - this significantly lowers the technical barrier. However, Forecaster 3's observation about multiple 'imminent test' warnings in 2022-2023 that never materialized is perhaps the most important new evidence. This establishes a strong base rate: even when preparations are complete and experts predict testing, North Korea has consistently chosen restraint. This pattern of false alarms over the past 2-3 years despite technical readiness powerfully reinforces the status quo argument. Both forecasters appropriately emphasized China's disapproval and the high diplomatic costs, which I noted but perhaps underweighted. Forecaster 3's 12% forecast seems somewhat high given the demonstrated pattern of restraint even when ready, while Forecaster 2's 5% appropriately captures the combination of technical readiness with political reluctance evidenced by recent history.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm revising my forecast slightly downward from 7% to 6%. The key update comes from Forecaster 3's point about 2022-2023 false alarms - this is critical base rate evidence showing that even when North Korea appears technically ready and experts predict imminent testing, they have repeatedly chosen not to test. This pattern of restraint despite readiness over a 2-3 year period suggests the political threshold for testing is very high. Combined with the extremely short 2-month window remaining, the probability should be at the lower end of my initial range. The completed preparations at Punggye-ri (Forecaster 2's point) do mean testing is technically feasible on short notice, preventing me from going below 5%. However, the demonstrated pattern of choosing missile tests and rhetoric over nuclear tests, China's likely opposition, and the lack of any current indicators of imminent testing all point toward continued status quo. The false alarm base rate is the decisive factor pushing me down from 7% to 6%.",
