  "information": "The U.S. State Department uses a four-level travel advisory system: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). Advisories are issued based on risks such as crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and health concerns. Level 3 and Level 4 advisories are reviewed at least every six months. As of early May 2025, there were 21 countries with a Level 4 advisory, including Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen.\n\nAs of May 2, 2025, the U.S. State Department's travel advisory for Niger is Level 3, 'Reconsider Travel,' last updated on March 21, 2023. The stated reasons for the advisory are terrorism, kidnapping, crime, and civil unrest. While the nationwide advisory is Level 3, specific areas within Niger are designated as Level 4, 'Do Not Travel,' including the Diffa region, the Lake Chad basin, and regions bordering Mali. Neighboring countries, including Mali and Burkina Faso, have nationwide Level 4 advisories.\n\nRecent changes to Level 4 advisories for other nations have been linked to specific security deteriorations. The advisory for South Sudan was elevated to Level 4 on March 8, 2025, which coincided with the ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel from the capital, Juba. The Level 4 advisory for the Democratic Republic of Congo cites high levels of violent crime, including armed robbery and kidnapping. The State Department also applies Level 4 warnings to sub-regions within countries, such as several states in Mexico and the Gaza Strip, due to localized risks of crime and armed conflict.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Niger maintains its current Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) advisory without being elevated to Level 4",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Niger's security situation remains concerning but stable enough that the State Department continues its Level 3 advisory through July 1, 2025. The Department maintains regional Level 4 designations for high-risk areas (Diffa, Lake Chad basin, Mali border regions) but doesn't upgrade the nationwide advisory. This mirrors the status quo that has persisted since March 2023.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant security deterioration occurs, such as a major terrorist attack affecting broader areas of Niger, widespread civil unrest, kidnapping of U.S. citizens, or spillover violence from neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso. This triggers either an ordered departure of U.S. embassy personnel or a comprehensive security review that results in elevating Niger to nationwide Level 4 status before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Niger has maintained a Level 3 advisory for over 2 years (since March 2023) despite persistent security concerns from terrorism, kidnapping, crime, and civil unrest. This stability in classification is significant - the State Department has had ample time and reason to upgrade if they deemed it necessary. Notably, the Department already employs regional Level 4 designations for Niger's highest-risk areas, demonstrating they can calibrate risk geographically rather than applying blanket nationwide restrictions. This nuanced approach suggests they view much of Niger as not meeting the Level 4 threshold. The regional context is concerning - Mali and Burkina Faso both have nationwide Level 4 advisories - but this proximity hasn't triggered a similar classification for Niger despite years of observation. Recent Level 4 upgrades (like South Sudan in March 2025) have coincided with specific trigger events such as ordered departures of U.S. personnel; no such imminent triggers are reported for Niger. However, several factors prevent a lower probability: Niger operates in an extremely volatile region, the advisory hasn't been formally updated in over 2 years (which could mean a review is overdue), and the July 2023 coup demonstrated ongoing political instability. The short 2-month timeframe makes major policy shifts less likely but doesn't eliminate the possibility of a security deterioration or scheduled review. For me to forecast higher, I would need evidence of deteriorating conditions, U.S. personnel movements, or announced policy reviews. For a lower forecast, I would need recent confirmation of Level 3 status or improved security indicators. Given the strong status quo bias (over 2 years at Level 3), the State Department's existing regional approach, and the short timeframe, but accounting for regional instability and review uncertainty, I estimate an 18% probability.",
