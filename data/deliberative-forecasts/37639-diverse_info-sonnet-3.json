    "review": "Both forecasters raised critical procedural details I significantly underweighted. Forecaster 2's point about the May 11 TRO extension (just 3 days ago) based on 'plausible' claims is crucial - this represents active, recent judicial intervention. Forecaster 3's technical detail about the automatic stay during BIA appeal is equally important. I had focused too heavily on political pressure and insufficiently on concrete legal barriers already in place. The combination of an active TRO, pending BIA appeal with automatic stay, typical BIA timelines (months, not weeks), and only 48 days remaining creates multiple independent barriers to deportation by July 1. My original reasoning overweighted executive motivation and underweighted the compounding effect of procedural protections. The status quo is not just 'legal proceedings happening' but specifically 'active court order preventing deportation plus automatic appellate stay.' For a 'Yes' outcome, multiple low-probability events must occur sequentially within 7 weeks: BIA must rule quickly AND favorably to government, federal court must lift TRO despite finding claims plausible, no additional stays must be sought/granted, and ICE must execute removal immediately. Each step adds delay risk.",
    "rationale": "I am updating significantly downward. The May 11 TRO extension is dispositive evidence that as of 3 days ago, a federal judge actively blocked deportation based on plausible constitutional claims. This is not merely potential future litigation but an existing barrier. Combined with Forecaster 3's point about automatic stays during BIA appeals, there are at least two independent procedural mechanisms currently preventing deportation. With 48 days until July 1, even if one barrier falls, the timeline for resolving the other plus executing removal is highly compressed. Normal BIA timelines are months; even expedited handling rarely produces final orders in weeks. Federal courts finding claims 'plausible' typically leads to extended proceedings, not rapid adverse rulings. The political pressure I emphasized matters less than these concrete legal obstacles already activated. I remain above Forecaster 2's 5% because national security grounds could theoretically trigger extraordinary expedited procedures, and higher courts could intervene on emergency basis, but these scenarios require unusual departures from standard process.",
