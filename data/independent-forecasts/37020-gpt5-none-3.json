    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 16 days (awards on May 8, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Lean Yes: with four nominations, including for a massively successful collaboration, he is more likely than not to pick up at least one award if current dynamics hold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "He’s shut out in all four categories: votes consolidate behind country mainstays (e.g., Morgan Wallen, Lainey Wilson, Chris Stapleton, Luke Combs), the ACM electorate is reluctant to reward a pop crossover, or he loses close races due to vote-splitting and strong alternative narratives.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "His blockbuster duet (e.g., I Had Some Help with Morgan Wallen) converts in a headline category like Single or Song of the Year, or he wins in Music Event/Visual Media; any one win resolves the question as Yes.",
    "rationale": "With four nominations, the union probability of winning at least one award is meaningfully above 50% even with tough fields. A simple base-rate model: if a nominee’s per-category win chance is roughly 20–30% (typical 5–6 nominee fields, adjusted for strength), the chance of at least one win across four independent shots is 1 − (1 − p)^4 ≈ 59% (p=0.20) to 76% (p=0.30). Post Malone’s case looks stronger than an average nominee because (a) he has multiple bites at the apple, and (b) his collaboration I Had Some Help was a dominant commercial and cultural hit, and collaborations with core country stars historically do get ACM recognition. That pushes me toward the middle-to-upper part of that range. Tempering factors: he faces elite competition (Wallen, Stapleton, Lainey Wilson, Luke Combs), and some voters may be hesitant to award a pop crossover as lead artist unless paired with a country favorite—though that cut both ways here because a collaborative win would still count. Netting these, I place the probability in the mid-to-high 60s. Why not higher: the ACM electorate can favor established country acts, and several categories are often tightly contested; it’s plausible he goes 0-for-4. Why not lower: four nominations plus one or two extremely strong entries (notably the Morgan Wallen collaboration) materially raise the odds that at least one converts. What would move me up: confirmation he’s favored in Single/Song/Music Event via industry chatter or odds, strong performance slot/telecast momentum, or historical category fields showing weaker competition this cycle. What would move me down: evidence that key categories are leaning toward rivals, unexpected rule nuances limiting his eligibility credit on a win, or signals of genre-gatekeeping sentiment among ACM voters. Research assistant provided no additional new information; forecast rests on base rates, market intuition, and known hit strength.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Post Malone win an award at the 60th Academy of Country Music Awards?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe awards are scheduled to be held on May 8, 2025. Malone has 4 nominations.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Post Malone wins an award at the [60th Academy of Country Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_Academy_of_Country_Music_Awards).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
