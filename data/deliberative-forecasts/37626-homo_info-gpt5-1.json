    "review": "Forecaster 2 rightly emphasizes the strict threshold and low month-to-month volatility, and that upstream costs (Dole, logistics/fees) don’t obviously support a sharp drop by May. However, their baseline claim that prices have “mostly sat at or above $0.63” downplays the recent prints under 63¢ noted by the RA (Jan 62.1¢, Mar 62.5¢). If the latest data are sub‑63¢, the status quo favors a Yes more than their 23% suggests. Forecaster 3 highlights the same threshold/volatility points but leans heavily on a claimed new 10% U.S. tariff on bananas effective Apr 5, 2025. I’m not aware of any enacted U.S. banana tariff in April; bananas are largely sourced from Latin America with longstanding preferences, and the May 14 China tariff news is irrelevant. That weakens their 15% case. Both forecasters appropriately cite rounding risk at 0.630 and the importance of the April print due May 14.",
    "rationale": "Key updates to my view: (1) The critical risk is proximity to 0.6300 and rounding—Yes requires ≤0.629. Even small MoM noise (±0.1–0.5¢) can flip the outcome. (2) I do not find the claim of a new U.S. banana tariff credible; absent that, the main cost pressures are freight/port fees, which are real but have shown mixed trends and often only partially pass through to a loss‑leader item like bananas. (3) The RA’s recent observations (Jan–Mar 2025 under 63¢) suggest the near-term baseline is already favorable for a sub‑0.630 print. (4) There is no widely reported acute supply shock specific to May. Balancing these, I reduce my earlier probability modestly to reflect the tight threshold and the unknown April reading arriving imminently. I would move higher if April prints ≤0.626–0.628 or if retail intel shows widespread $0.55–$0.59 pricing in May; lower if April lands ≥0.631 or if multiple majors show sustained ~0.65–0.69 pricing. Change from prior: down from 72% to 64% to weight rounding/threshold risk and the unreleased April data more heavily.",
