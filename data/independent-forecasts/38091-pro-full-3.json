  "information": "In the first five months of 2025, three countries signed the Artemis Accords: Finland (January 23), Bangladesh (April 8), and Norway (May 15), bringing the total number of signatories to 55. This follows the signings of Panama and Austria in December 2024. In a statement on May 22, 2025, acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro said that NASA anticipates additional countries will sign the accords in the coming weeks and months.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates hosted an international Artemis Accords workshop in Abu Dhabi on May 21-22, 2025. Representatives from over 30 of the 55 signatory countries attended to discuss the implementation of the Accords' principles, including transparency, data sharing, and sustainability in space. In addition, the 2025 Humans to the Moon & Mars Summit (H2M2) was held in Washington, D.C., on May 28-29, bringing together leaders from government, industry, and international space agencies to discuss the future of human space exploration.\n\nAs of late May 2025, there have been no public announcements of a specific country planning to sign the Artemis Accords during the month of June. In a parallel development in international space exploration, China and Russia have announced a joint plan to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2035 to power their International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). The ILRS project is positioned as a rival to the US-led Artemis program and has secured partnerships with 17 countries.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be definitively known on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new country signs the Artemis Accords in June 2025, maintaining the total number of signatories at 55.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes without any official signing ceremonies or announcements from new countries. While diplomatic discussions with potential signatories continue behind the scenes, no nation finalizes its internal approvals and makes a public commitment during the month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following recent diplomatic engagements like the workshops in Abu Dhabi and Washington D.C., a country that has been in advanced discussions with the U.S. State Department and NASA officially signs the Artemis Accords between June 1 and June 30, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the recent frequency of signings and recent forward-looking statements from US officials. \n\nPositive indicators for a 'Yes' outcome: The rate of signatories has been steady. Since the beginning of 2024 (a 17-month period), 15 countries have signed, an average of approximately 0.88 per month. This base rate suggests a signing in any given month is more likely than not. More specifically, the Acting NASA Administrator's statement on May 22, 2025, anticipating signings in the 'coming weeks and months' is a strong positive signal that momentum exists and new signatories are in the pipeline for the immediate future. Recent international workshops also serve as catalysts for finalizing such agreements.\n\nNegative indicators for a 'Yes' outcome: The primary reason for a lower probability is the lack of a specific public announcement or even a strong rumor of an imminent signing in June. Signings are not perfectly regular; for instance, there were no new signatories in February or March of 2025. Diplomatic processes are complex and a signing planned for June could easily slip into July for administrative or political reasons, which would resolve this question as 'No'.\n\nConclusion: Balancing these factors, the strong underlying momentum and the explicit official statement about 'coming weeks' outweigh the lack of a named candidate. The base rate suggests a probability near 60%, and the recent qualitative evidence slightly increases my confidence. My forecast is not higher because of the inherent uncertainty of diplomatic timing and the absence of a confirmed next signatory. It is not lower because that would under-weigh the consistent historical trend and the very recent, optimistic official statements. I would increase my forecast if a specific country is publicly named as a likely June signatory. I would decrease it if the first half of June passes with no announcements.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
