    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 48 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the site remains online and reachable, as it is today.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "EPA rapidly decommissions the domain before July 1 (DNS removed or servers shut down), or the domain experiences a prolonged outage exactly when Metaculus checks, causing IsItDownRightNow to report it as down.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The program is winding down but the site stays up (even as a notice/redirect/archival page), and IsItDownRightNow reports it reachable when checked on/after July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: As of May 7, IsItDownRightNow reports energystar.gov is up. Government web properties typically persist through program changes due to wind‑down needs, public communication, records retention, and to avoid breaking links. Even if content is removed or redirected, the domain responding at all would register as “up.”\n- Program vs. domain: Eliminating or de‑prioritizing Energy Star does not require immediate domain shutdown. Given Energy Star’s 30+ years of brand use and the need to guide manufacturers/consumers during any transition, it’s more likely the site remains accessible (possibly with notices or redirects) for months, not weeks.\n- Timeline/inertia: Only ~7 weeks remain. Federal IT changes, including .gov domain decommissioning, usually take planning and approvals. Rapid takedowns are possible but less common and politically riskier than leaving a static/notice page.\n- Measurement nuance: The resolution depends on IsItDownRightNow at the time Metaculus checks on/after July 1. This introduces a small measurement/outage risk (e.g., transient downtime, DNS hiccups). Still, business-day timing reduces maintenance risk, and Metaculus can check after July 1, lowering the chance that a brief outage determines the result.\n- Why not higher: Non-zero chance of a deliberate quick takedown to signal policy change; possibility of DNS or hosting changes causing temporary unreachability; reliance on a single third-party status page for resolution.\n- Why not lower: Status quo strongly favors persistence; site currently up; redirects or archival pages would still count as online; short time horizon.\n- What would raise my forecast: EPA/DOE statements or IT notices indicating the domain will remain as an archive/redirect; evidence of a long-term 301 to epa.gov working reliably; contract/renewal entries showing hosting continuity past July.\n- What would lower my forecast: Credible reporting or official notice of an imminent shutdown of energystar.gov; removal of DNS records (NS/A/AAAA) in zone files; sustained outages detected by multiple monitors; evidence of a hard deadline to retire the domain before July.\n- Research assistant input: No new info beyond current uptime, which supports the status quo expectation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
