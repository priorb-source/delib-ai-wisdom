    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (Metaculus will check on/after July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — neither Trump nor Musk posts a tweet/X post containing the exact phrase “diversity visa.”",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "They talk about immigration, border policy, or visas, but use different wording (e.g., “visa lottery,” “DV lottery,” “diversity lottery,” or “merit-based immigration”) and never type the exact words “diversity visa.” Trump continues to post rarely on X or favors other platforms; Musk doesn’t pick up the niche term despite high posting volume.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A salient immigration news cycle or policy proposal specifically targets the Diversity Visa program (e.g., a move to end/reform it or a high-profile incident tied to a DV recipient). In reacting, either Trump or Musk uses the exact phrase “diversity visa” (e.g., “End the Diversity Visa Lottery”), or Musk replies to a post on the topic and repeats the phrase.",
    "rationale": "I’m using the stated resolution criteria (an exact-match search for “diversity visa” from either account checked on/after July 1, 2025). With ~40 days left and no qualifying posts yet, the base rate is low: this is a niche policy term, and the match requires the exact phrase. Trump has historically criticized the Diversity Visa program (notably in 2017) but currently appears to use X sparingly relative to other platforms, lowering odds in a short window. Musk posts frequently on immigration but tends to use broader terms; the chance he chooses the exact phrase within 40 days without a strong news hook is small. I keep the probability above zero because (1) two independent high-volume, policy-oriented accounts are eligible, (2) immigration can spike in salience quickly, and (3) a single policy push or viral incident could prompt explicit wording like “Diversity Visa Lottery.” It’s not higher due to the exact-phrase constraint, niche topic, and short time left. I would update upward if: an administration or congressional proposal to end/reform the Diversity Visa makes headlines; a DV-linked incident trends; Trump begins posting on X much more; or Musk engages with DV-specific content and mirrors the wording. I’d update downward if the immigration news cycle remains generic, Trump continues to avoid X, and Musk’s discourse stays focused on broader border/illegal immigration themes without DV references. The research assistant provided no additional info, so this estimate weights status quo heavily.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**. If not, it resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
