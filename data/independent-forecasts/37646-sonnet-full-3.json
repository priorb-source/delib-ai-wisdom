  "information": "Somalia's National Communications Authority granted Starlink a full operating license in mid-April 2025, following approximately two and a half years of discussions. On April 13, 2025, Elon Musk announced on social media, \"Starlink is in Somalia.\" At a ceremony in Mogadishu, Starlink representatives stated the service would be available nationwide soon. Somali government officials, including the Minister of Communications and Technology, publicly welcomed the service, highlighting its potential to provide internet access across the country. As of mid-May 2025, the official Starlink availability map listed Somalia as \"Not Available\" or \"Coming Soon.\"\n\nThe time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming \"Available\" varies. For several African nations, the lag has been several months: Nigeria's service went live approximately four months after licensing in 2023, while Rwanda's took about four months. The median time for recent African launches has been estimated at 4–8 months. However, some rollouts have been much faster; for example, Bangladesh's service became available in about two weeks in May 2025. Conversely, some countries, such as Zambia, India, and Vietnam, have remained in a \"Coming Soon\" status for many months after receiving licenses.\n\nStarlink can provide service to Somalia without an in-country gateway station due to its use of inter-satellite laser links, which can connect to ground stations in neighboring countries like Kenya or Ethiopia. A report by the Washington Post indicated that the U.S. government has been diplomatically promoting Starlink's expansion in various countries, including Somalia. Local challenges in Somalia include a fragile security environment, complex import logistics for user terminals, and difficulties with payment processing infrastructure. According to 2022 World Bank data, about 30% of Somalia's 18 million people have internet access.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks (47 days) from May 15, 2025 until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Somalia remains listed as 'Not Available' or 'Coming Soon' on the Starlink availability map",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Starlink continues typical African rollout timeline of 4-8 months. Despite the license being granted in mid-April, technical deployment, logistics challenges (security environment, import procedures, payment infrastructure), and company prioritization decisions mean Somalia remains in 'Coming Soon' status through July 1, 2025, similar to how Zambia, India, and Vietnam have remained in extended pre-launch phases.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink accelerates Somalia's deployment similar to the Bangladesh model (2 weeks from license to availability). Using inter-satellite laser links and existing regional ground stations, combined with U.S. diplomatic support and high-level Musk attention following his April 13 announcement, the company fast-tracks Somalia to 'Available' status within the next 6.5 weeks.",
    "rationale": "The license was granted approximately one month ago (mid-April 2025) and only 6.5 weeks remain until the July 1 deadline, providing a total window of roughly 2.5 months from license to deadline. The status quo strongly favors 'No' - Somalia currently shows as 'Not Available' or 'Coming Soon' despite a month having passed since licensing. Historical data shows African Starlink rollouts typically take 4-8 months (median), with Nigeria and Rwanda both requiring approximately 4 months. At 2.5 months total, this would be notably faster than the regional baseline. However, Bangladesh's recent 2-week rollout demonstrates rapid deployment is possible when prioritized. Positive factors include: Elon Musk's direct public announcement, no need for in-country gateway stations due to inter-satellite links, U.S. government diplomatic backing, and full operating license already secured. Negative factors include: Somalia's fragile security situation, complex import logistics, payment infrastructure challenges, and most critically, no evidence of imminent 'Available' status despite one month already elapsed. The base rate of 4-8 months for African launches is the strongest predictor. For the forecast to be higher, I would need evidence that Somalia has been prioritized similar to Bangladesh, or insider information about imminent launch. For it to be lower, I would discount the Bangladesh precedent entirely and rely solely on the African median. Given the time constraints, status quo bias favoring slow institutional change, and typical rollout timelines, but acknowledging the possibility of accelerated deployment given high-level attention and recent fast-rollout precedent, I estimate a 30% probability.",
