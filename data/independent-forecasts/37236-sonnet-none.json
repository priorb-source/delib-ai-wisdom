    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-7 weeks. The US Census Bureau typically releases monthly trade data 6-8 weeks after the month's end, so April 2025 data should be published in early-to-mid June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on historical patterns, US exports typically show modest year-over-year nominal growth due to inflation (2-3% annually) and economic expansion. This baseline expectation would suggest April 2025 exports exceeding the April 2024 baseline of $262,578 million, pointing toward a Yes outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 exports remain at or below $262,578 million. This occurs if Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs trigger significant retaliatory measures from trading partners that reduce demand for US goods. Additional factors could include trade policy uncertainty causing exporters to delay shipments, a stronger dollar reducing competitiveness, or general global economic weakness dampening demand for US exports.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 exports exceed $262,578 million. This happens if the normal trend of nominal export growth (driven by inflation and economic expansion) continues despite tariff disruptions. Other contributing factors could include: anticipatory surge in exports before further tariff escalation, lagged effects meaning tariff impacts haven't fully materialized by April, or specific sectors remaining strong despite overall trade tensions.",
    "rationale": "This forecast balances competing forces with significant uncertainty. The status quo favors modest growth: historical data shows US exports typically increase year-over-year in nominal terms, and even modest 2-3% inflation-driven growth would push April 2025 exports above the $262,578 million threshold to approximately $268-270 million. However, the explicit mention of Trump's tariffs introduces substantial downside risk. Tariffs typically provoke retaliatory measures that harm exports, and trade policy uncertainty generally depresses trade volumes. The critical unknown is timing—if tariffs were implemented recently in Q1 2025, their full impact on April export data may be limited as trade flows adjust slowly. Conversely, if tariffs were announced earlier, retaliation effects could be more pronounced by April. Without the research assistant providing data on: (1) recent monthly export trends in early 2025, (2) the specific timing and scale of tariff implementation, (3) documented retaliatory measures, or (4) current global economic conditions, I face high uncertainty. My forecast is not higher because the tariff context suggests meaningful trade disruption that could overwhelm normal growth trends. It's not lower because: nominal growth provides a baseline tailwind, tariff effects may be lagged, and April represents only one month where volatility could favor either direction. I would revise upward if data showed: strong export growth in January-March 2025, limited retaliation from trading partners, or dollar weakness. I would revise downward with evidence of: accelerating retaliatory tariffs, sharp export declines in Q1 2025, or broad-based trade disruptions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US exports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of exports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 262,578 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
