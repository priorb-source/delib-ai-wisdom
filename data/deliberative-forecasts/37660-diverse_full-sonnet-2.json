    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling points I hadn't fully weighted. Forecaster 3 effectively emphasizes that once regulatory clearance comes, Starlink can update the availability map very quickly - this is a fair point about the technical execution speed. Both forecasters also highlight the regional momentum argument more strongly: Bangladesh moving to launch in May 2025 demonstrates Starlink has active operational focus and capability in South Asia right now, which I underweighted. Forecaster 2's framing that foundational approvals are complete and only a political decision is needed is reasonable.\n\nHowever, I find their 40-44% range slightly too optimistic given the evidence. The key weakness in their analyses is insufficient weight on the negative signals: (1) discussions were explicitly described as 'preliminary stage' in late March, suggesting substantial work remained, (2) the expected April launch completely failed to materialize with no reported progress since, and (3) it's now mid-May with zero visible positive developments. If resolution were imminent, we'd likely have heard something.\n\nTheir point about rapid implementation once approved is valid, but this assumes approval comes soon. Security ministries negotiating lawful intercept capabilities typically move in months, not weeks. The Pakistan parallel (still delayed on security checks) is more relevant than the Bangladesh example (which had different regulatory dynamics).\n\nThe conflicting official statements (expecting April operations vs. preliminary discussions) suggest either poor coordination or genuine uncertainty within government, both of which extend timelines rather than compress them.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm moderately updating upward from my initial 30% forecast. They convince me that I was somewhat too pessimistic about the potential for rapid political resolution and quick technical implementation once approval comes. The points about Starlink's demonstrated regional capability (Bangladesh) and the speed at which the availability map can be updated once clearance is granted are well-taken.\n\nHowever, I don't find their 40-44% range fully justified. The fundamental issue remains: we're in mid-May with no reported progress since late March when talks were described as 'preliminary.' The April timeline failed completely, which is a strong negative signal about how close resolution actually was. Security and lawful intercept negotiations are rarely resolved in 6-8 weeks, particularly when multiple ministries are involved and discussions were still preliminary less than two months ago.\n\nMy updated view weights four key factors: (1) Negative: zero progress signals since March and missed April deadline suggest resolution is not imminent; (2) Negative: lawful intercept requirements typically take months to negotiate and implement; (3) Positive: license and tariffs already approved reduces friction once security issues resolve; (4) Positive: if political approval comes, map updates can happen quickly.\n\nBalancing these, I'm updating to 35% - acknowledging the valid points about rapid implementation potential while maintaining appropriate skepticism about the security negotiation timeline. This reflects that while a breakthrough before July 1 is possible, the evidence suggests delays will likely persist beyond the deadline.",
