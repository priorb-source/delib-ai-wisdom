  "information": "According to reports from the Nikkei newspaper, the upcoming G7 summit may not produce a traditional final joint statement due to disagreements between the U.S. and other member nations. The summit may instead result in several separate documents on specific topics of cooperation, while excluding more contentious issues like global trade and relations with Russia from the formal agenda to avoid conflict. In preparation for the summit, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House on June 5.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, the US President is expected to attend major international summits like the G7.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A severe diplomatic dispute close to the summit date or a sudden domestic/health crisis causes President Trump to cancel his attendance as a last-minute decision.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "President Trump follows standard diplomatic protocol and attends the summit in person, engaging with other leaders despite policy disagreements.",
    "rationale": "The base rate for a sitting US President attending the G7 summit is extremely high; it is a fundamental part of the job. The status quo is strong attendance. The provided research indicates significant policy disagreements among G7 members, which slightly increases the chance of a diplomatic disruption. However, this is strongly counteracted by the scheduled meeting between President Trump and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on June 5. This meeting indicates active, high-level diplomatic engagement just before the summit, making a planned boycott highly unlikely. With the summit occurring this month, the logistical and security arrangements would be finalized, creating significant inertia towards attendance. My forecast is not higher than 94% primarily due to President Trump's documented history of unpredictability and willingness to disregard diplomatic norms, leaving a small but non-trivial probability of a last-minute cancellation. My forecast is not lower because boycotting the G7 would be a major diplomatic incident with close allies, and all current evidence, particularly the Scholz meeting, points toward engagement, not withdrawal. I would lower my forecast if the Scholz meeting were abruptly cancelled or if credible reports of a US ultimatum to allies emerged. I would raise it upon a positive joint statement from the Trump-Scholz meeting.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCTV: [Donald Trump will visit Canada for G7, White House confirms](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/article/white-house-confirms-trump-will-visit-canada-for-g7-leaders-summit/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to reports from the Nikkei newspaper, the upcoming G7 summit may not produce a traditional final joint statement due to disagreements between the U.S. and other member nations.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
