    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my priors but add useful emphasis on two points: (1) unanimity now spans 10 members, increasing veto risk; and (2) Indonesia’s January 2025 accession may reduce appetite for another near-term addition before/at Rio. I also agree with their caution about politically sensitive candidates (Belarus, Cuba, Turkey) and the observation that some partners haven’t confirmed participation yet, which weakens their near-term viability. I’m less convinced by the higher (45%) view given the lack of credible pre-summit signaling so close to the event; host-deliverable dynamics are real, but often leak if advanced. The lower (32%) view’s consolidation argument resonates, though I still give some weight to late-breaking deals and China/Russia’s push for momentum plus Brazil’s hosting incentives.",
    "rationale": "Roughly five weeks remain, and invitations can occur before or at the summit. The pipeline exists (partner tier), and there are plausible, less-controversial candidates (e.g., Malaysia, Thailand, Kazakhstan, Nigeria). China/Russia likely favor continued expansion, and Brazil may want a deliverable. However, unanimity across 10 members is a meaningful hurdle; India and Brazil have been cautious; some partners haven’t confirmed participation; and the bloc just added Indonesia in 2025, which reduces the marginal incentive for another addition so soon. The absence of credible pre-signaling or leaks by late May tilts me toward the status quo. I’m leaving a non-trivial tail for a late consensus emerging from pre-summit ministerial/sherpa work or an off-summit invitation timed just before Rio, but I slightly reduce my estimate to reflect consolidation dynamics and lack of visible momentum.",
