    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Anthropic remains a private company and makes no announcement regarding an IPO.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic's leadership and major investors decide that remaining private is strategically advantageous for the time being. They continue to leverage private funding rounds from partners like Google and Amazon to fuel their growth, avoiding the quarterly reporting pressures and public scrutiny that come with an IPO, allowing them to focus on long-term R&D in a highly competitive market.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by the need for a massive capital injection to compete in the AI arms race and pressure from early investors seeking liquidity, Anthropic's board has been secretly preparing for a public offering for months. They decide that market conditions are favorable and either file their S-1 with the SEC or make a strategic announcement on their website to signal their intentions to the market.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the extremely short timeframe. The deadline is July 1, 2025, which is less than two months away. Preparing for an IPO, including the drafting and filing of an S-1 document, is a complex and lengthy process that typically takes 6-12 months or more. Given that there are no public signals, leaks, or reports of Anthropic having engaged investment banks or legal counsel for an IPO, it is highly improbable that they would be ready to make a formal announcement within the next ~45 days. The status quo is that Anthropic is a well-capitalized private company, having secured billions in funding from major tech players like Google and Amazon. This private capital reduces the immediate urgency to tap public markets for funds. Therefore, the default and most likely outcome is that they will not make such an announcement in this window.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 10% because the AI sector is exceptionally dynamic, and corporate strategies can shift rapidly. An announcement could be made as a strategic surprise to capitalize on a market window or to get ahead of competitors. The floated $40 billion valuation indicates strong investor appetite, which might accelerate IPO plans that are currently happening behind the scenes. It's possible, though unlikely, that the preparatory work is already complete and the company is simply waiting for the opportune moment to announce.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 10% because of the powerful counter-evidence provided by the short timeline and the complete lack of preparatory signals. Without any rumors of banker appointments, S-1 drafting, or executive commentary, a surprise IPO announcement in the next month and a half would be a major corporate anomaly.\n\nI would update my forecast higher if credible media reports emerged that Anthropic had hired IPO advisors or was actively working on an S-1 filing. I would update lower if they announced another significant private funding round, as this would signal their intent to remain private for the foreseeable future.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
