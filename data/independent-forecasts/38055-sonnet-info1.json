  "information": "The middleweight bout between Joe Pyfer and Kelvin Gastelum is scheduled for the main card of UFC 316, which will take place on June 7, 2025, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. This is a rebooked fight, originally scheduled for UFC Mexico on March 29 before being cancelled. According to UFCStats 'tale of the tape' data, Pyfer has a slight grappling and reach advantage, while Gastelum fights from a southpaw stance.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12 days until June 7, 2025, when UFC 316 takes place",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The fight between Joe Pyfer and Kelvin Gastelum is scheduled for the main card and expected to proceed as planned",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The fight is cancelled last-minute due to injury, weight miss, or other issues preventing Pyfer from competing, OR Pyfer fights Gastelum but loses via decision, submission, or knockout",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The fight proceeds as scheduled and Joe Pyfer defeats Kelvin Gastelum via decision, submission, or knockout at UFC 316",
    "rationale": "With only 12 days until the event and the bout already on the main card as a rebooked fight, the likelihood of cancellation is relatively low (approximately 10-15%). Both fighters have already committed once before, reducing cancellation risk. The key uncertainty is the fight outcome itself. According to the research assistant, Pyfer holds slight advantages in grappling and reach, which are meaningful factors in MMA but not overwhelming predictors. Gastelum is an experienced southpaw fighter, and stance matchups can be unpredictable. Without detailed recent performance data for both fighters, I must be cautious about overconfidence. In MMA, even clear favorites rarely exceed 65-70% win probability due to the sport's inherent variance. With 'slight' advantages rather than dominant ones, Pyfer appears to be a modest favorite, which I estimate at approximately 55-60% to win if the fight occurs. Combining the high probability the fight happens (~88%) with a modest edge in the fight itself (~57%) yields an overall probability around 50%. This forecast would increase with evidence of Pyfer's superior recent form, a significant skill gap, or Gastelum showing decline. It would decrease if Gastelum demonstrates strong recent performances, injury concerns for Pyfer emerge, or if last-minute cancellation risks materialize.",
