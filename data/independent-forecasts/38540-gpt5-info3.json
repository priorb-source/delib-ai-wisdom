    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~16 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic’s top Claude variant (e.g., Claude 3.5/3.6 Sonnet) or another competitor (e.g., Google Gemini or a top open-source entrant like DeepSeek) holds or takes the #1 overall spot on the Arena by July 1, and no OpenAI model is tied for #1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An OpenAI model (e.g., GPT-4.1/4o/o4-family) is at #1 overall or tied for #1 on the Arena when checked on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon and inertia: With only ~16 days left, large Elo movements at the top are uncommon without a major new model release or a leaderboard inclusion change. The current leader (whoever it is) has a strong chance to persist to July 1.\n- Base rates: Over the past year, the #1 slot has generally been occupied by OpenAI or Anthropic models, with occasional small lead changes. Ties count as Yes, slightly boosting the chance for OpenAI if it’s closely competitive.\n- Competitive landscape: OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google remain the primary contenders for top preference ratings. Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 series has at times held #1; OpenAI’s GPT-4.1/4o family has also frequently been at or near #1. Open-source breakthroughs (e.g., DeepSeek) have improved rapidly but, historically, proprietary models dominate the overall Arena top spot.\n- Research assistant note: The fairness debate (\"Leaderboard Illusion\") doesn’t directly affect the resolution criteria. If anything, the ability of major labs to selectively list strong variants slightly raises the odds that an OpenAI model is competitive for #1.\n- Why not higher: I don’t have direct confirmation of who is #1 as of June 15. If Anthropic currently leads with a non-trivial Elo margin and strong sample count, the probability OpenAI overtakes in two weeks is limited. Also, a late-June release from Anthropic/Google could secure or reclaim #1.\n- Why not lower: Even without new releases, OpenAI models are consistently top-tier in Arena preferences, and ties count. The short window reduces the chance of a large downward shift for OpenAI if it’s already near the top.\n- What would move me up: Evidence that an OpenAI model is currently #1 or tied, especially with a comfortable Elo gap and high vote count; or news of a fresh OpenAI model/update being added to the Arena imminently.\n- What would move me down: Confirmation that Anthropic (or another competitor) is currently #1 with a solid Elo margin and sample size; removal/downtime of a leading OpenAI model from the Arena; or a strong new non-OpenAI release being added and quickly accruing a lead.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill an OpenAI model be ranked #1 overall on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of the 2nd Quarter of 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMethodology: [Chatbot Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating LLMs by Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a model owned by OpenAI is in the number 1 overall rank (ties count) at the [Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this is not the case, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nScroll down to Arena Overview and the resolution is based on the \"overall\" rank.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nChatbot Arena is a crowdsourced benchmarking platform that uses an Elo rating system based on user votes from anonymous, side-by-side model comparisons.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
