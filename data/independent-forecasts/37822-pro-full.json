  "information": "In late April 2025, during a series of town hall meetings, Beto O'Rourke stated that he would consider running for the U.S. Senate if it aligns with the desires of Texas voters. Quoted in multiple outlets such as Fox News, The Hill, and Yahoo, he said, 'If it comes to pass that this is what the people of Texas want, that it's the highest and best use of what I can give to you, then yes, I will.' As of late May 2025, O'Rourke had not filed any formal candidacy papers with the FEC and no campaign infrastructure or exploratory committee was visible. He continues his work with the voter mobilization organization 'Powered by People,' which he founded in 2019.\n\nThe 2026 Texas U.S. Senate election features incumbent Republican Senator John Cornyn seeking a fifth term. Cornyn faces a primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has already announced his campaign. On the Democratic side, while O'Rourke is publicly considering a run, other figures like former Congressman Colin Allred have also been mentioned as potential candidates, though none had formally entered the race as of late May 2025.\n\nHistorical timelines for major Texas campaigns show variation. For the 2024 Senate race, Democrat Colin Allred announced his candidacy in May 2023, 17 months before the election. Beto O'Rourke's own record includes announcing his 2018 Senate bid 20 months early (March 2017) and his 2022 gubernatorial run 12 months early (November 2021). The question's deadline of July 1, 2025, is approximately 16 months prior to the November 2026 general election.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known by July 1, 2025, which is in 39 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of May 22, 2025, Beto O'Rourke has not announced a candidacy for the US Senate. If he makes no announcement by the deadline, the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beto O'Rourke continues his 'listening tour' and work with his 'Powered by People' organization through June 2025. He ultimately decides either not to run, or to delay his announcement until later in the year to better assess the political landscape, particularly the Republican primary between John Cornyn and Ken Paxton. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without a formal declaration of candidacy.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following his recent series of town halls, O'Rourke's internal polling and fundraising indicators show a viable path to victory. He concludes that an early announcement is crucial for building momentum and consolidating support. In June 2025, he formally launches his campaign for the US Senate via a press conference and a campaign video released on social media.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant tension between Beto O'Rourke's historical campaign timelines and the current lack of formal campaign infrastructure. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' vote is precedent. The July 1, 2025 deadline is approximately 16 months before the November 2026 election. This timing fits squarely between his previous statewide announcements for the 2018 Senate race (20 months prior) and the 2022 Gubernatorial race (12 months prior). His recent public comments about running 'if the people of Texas want' are classic political maneuvers to build suspense and media attention immediately preceding a campaign launch. However, the current status quo strongly points to a 'No' outcome. As of late May 2025, O'Rourke has not filed any FEC paperwork, hired staff, or formed an exploratory committee. Launching a major Senate campaign within the next 39 days from a standing start, while possible, would be a very rapid mobilization. After two high-profile statewide losses in 2018 and 2022, he may be more cautious, choosing to wait longer to see how the political field develops before committing. My probability is not higher because the lack of any visible preparatory steps is a significant counter-signal to an imminent announcement. A decision to wait until the fall is a very plausible alternative strategy. My probability is not lower because the ~16-month pre-election window is an ideal time for a major candidate to announce, and his recent public statements are a strong indicator of near-term intent. I would increase my forecast if there were credible leaks of staff hiring or a campaign headquarters being set up. I would decrease my forecast if another major Democrat, like Colin Allred, were to announce, or if O'Rourke made statements explicitly suggesting a longer decision timeline.",
