  "information": "The United States and Ukraine have signed an agreement establishing a fund for reconstruction and granting the US administration access to Ukraine's mineral resources, including rare earth minerals. In an official statement about the deal, the US Treasury Department mentioned the 'large-scale invasion' of Ukraine by Russia. In parallel, the US has urged both Russia and Ukraine to accept its peace proposal during a UN Security Council meeting. On February 24, 2025, the US voted against a UN resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory, aligning with Russia and North Korea. The US presented an alternative resolution that called for a 'swift end' to the conflict without mentioning Russian aggression.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued warnings that Russia may be preparing a new wave of aggression under the guise of the upcoming 'West-2025' military exercises in Belarus. The potential targets mentioned in these warnings include a further invasion of Ukraine, or an attack on Lithuania or Poland. Zelensky stated that intelligence reports indicate Russia is building up its military forces in Belarus, with as many as 150,000 soldiers, for a potential invasion of a NATO country. In response, Ukraine's State Border Guard Service is closely monitoring the border with Belarus and tracking the movement of Russian units.\n\nRussia's recent history of military invasions includes Georgia in 2008, the annexation of Crimea and intervention in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The US has historically been prompt in publicly accusing Russia of military aggression when it occurs. Currently, Russia's military remains heavily committed in Ukraine. Reports from various think tanks and news organizations, including RUSI, CSIS, Politico, and the BBC, do not indicate any new, significant Russian troop buildups for operations in countries other than Ukraine.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Exactly 2 months, from May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Russia does not invade any country other than Ukraine, and the United States does not make such an accusation",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia continues its military operations exclusively in Ukraine without opening new fronts. The West-2025 military exercises in Belarus proceed as planned training exercises without escalating into an actual invasion. Russia's military forces remain committed to the Ukraine theater, and there are no significant troop movements toward other countries that would trigger a US accusation of invasion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Russia uses the West-2025 exercises in Belarus as a pretext or cover to invade Lithuania or Poland, crossing internationally recognized borders with ground forces. The United States, following its historical pattern of promptly calling out Russian military aggression, publicly accuses Russia of invading a NATO member state, triggering Article 5 considerations.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a NO outcome for multiple compelling reasons. First, credible Western intelligence sources (RUSI, CSIS, Politico, BBC) do not corroborate Ukrainian warnings about Russian troop buildups for operations outside Ukraine, despite Zelensky's claims of 150,000 Russian soldiers in Belarus. Second, Russia's military remains heavily committed in Ukraine, limiting its capacity to open a new front within the 2-month timeframe. Third, invading a NATO member like Lithuania or Poland would trigger Article 5, representing a massive escalation that would be catastrophic for Russia. Fourth, the research assistant notes a recent US diplomatic shift - voting against UN resolutions demanding Russian withdrawal and presenting alternatives without mentioning Russian aggression - suggesting possible policy changes that might make the US less likely to make new accusations. Fifth, only 2 months remain, which is an extremely compressed timeframe for mobilizing, positioning, and executing a major invasion while maintaining Ukraine operations. The probability is not zero because Russia has previously surprised the West with military actions, and the West-2025 exercises could theoretically provide operational cover. However, the combination of military constraints, lack of corroborating intelligence, NATO Article 5 implications, and time limitations heavily weight this toward the status quo. I would update upward if credible Western intelligence confirmed major buildups near NATO borders or if provocative incidents occurred in the Baltics. I would update downward if West-2025 exercises conclude peacefully or if Russian forces show no signs of redeployment from Ukraine.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
