    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Likely Yes (Erbil typically lists low-to-mid 30s summer destinations)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Seasonal additions fail to materialize on the schedule or are canceled/paused (e.g., due to security incidents, airspace disruptions, or demand shortfalls), keeping EBL at 31 or fewer listed destinations on FlightsFrom on July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Summer seasonal routes to Turkish leisure cities, Gulf/Saudi additions, and a handful of Europe/Caucasus services are active and listed on FlightsFrom on July 1, pushing EBL to 32+ destinations.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/seasonality: Erbil International Airport tends to have its largest network in summer, with robust Gulf connectivity, multiple Turkish airports (including seasonal leisure destinations like Antalya/Trabzon/Izmir/Bodrum), Jordan/Egypt/Levant links, some Iran and Saudi routes, and a handful of Europe/Caucasus services. A reasonable summer tally often lands in the low-to-mid 30s. That places the threshold (>31) slightly on the “yes” side. \n- Article context: The referenced piece (“Kurdistan Summer 2025: A Promising Season”) is consistent with a seasonal upswing in tourism and flights, supporting the expectation of additional summer destinations. \n- Short horizon: With roughly five and a half weeks left, most July schedules are already filed; major changes are less likely, though not impossible. \n- Why not higher: The threshold is tight. A few marginal seasonal routes could be delayed, not loaded in schedules, or pulled for operational/security reasons. Regional security shocks (e.g., cross-border strikes, temporary airspace restrictions) can cause last-minute suspensions. Also, some European services remain more variable and could underperform. Any of these could keep the count at 31 or lower on the specific check date. \n- Why not lower: Core regional demand (Gulf, Turkey, Jordan/Egypt) is strong and resilient; July is peak season. Even with some trims, EBL usually sustains a broad network. The preponderance of near-neighbor short-haul routes provides multiple independent paths to exceed 31. \n- What would move me up: Verifiable current FlightsFrom count already ≥32; announcements or loaded schedules for additional Turkish leisure, Saudi (incl. Medina/Riyadh/Dammam), or Caucasus/Europe routes active on/after July 1; evidence of added capacity for summer travel. \n- What would move me down: Confirmed current count ≤31; news of suspensions by key carriers (e.g., Turkish/PEG, major Gulf carriers), Iraq/Kurdistan airspace restrictions around late June/early July, or cancellations of seasonal services that would otherwise push the count over the threshold. \n- Research assistant summary: No additional information available beyond the article context; thus, I lean on general airport seasonality patterns and regional aviation dynamics.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 31 direct flight destinations from Erbil, Iraq on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nShafaq News: [Kurdistan Summer 2025: A Promising Season](https://shafaq.com/en/Kurdistan/Kurdistan-Summer-2025-A-Promising-Season)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 31 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Erbil (EBL)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/EBL) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
