    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (resolution window: after May 30 through June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — absent a specific scheduled signing, most days do not feature new accessions.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No country announces or completes accession during June; interested governments slip timelines to July or later due to domestic processes, scheduling, or diplomatic bandwidth.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A country signs during a June diplomatic moment (e.g., at a major aerospace event or a bilateral visit), with a same-day announcement by the U.S. State Department/NASA.",
    "rationale": "- Base rate and recent cadence: There have been two signings in the past ~7 weeks (Bangladesh on Apr 8, 2025; Norway on May 15, 2025), consistent with roughly monthly momentum. With 55 signatories and many plausible candidates remaining (e.g., additional European microstates, Central American, African, Gulf, and Southeast Asian countries), at least one June signing is plausible.  \n- Event-driven clustering: Artemis Accord signings often coincide with high-profile events or bilateral visits. June typically features major aerospace gatherings (e.g., the Paris Air Show), which historically create diplomatic windows for announcements. This slightly lifts the odds versus a random month.  \n- Saturation/diminishing returns: As the pool of likely joiners narrows, the hazard rate should gradually decline, keeping the probability from being very high. Some remaining countries have alignment or legislative constraints that slow timelines.  \n- Status quo pull: The default on any given day is “no new signing,” and there is no public, credible pre-announcement of a June accession as of May 29. This tempers the forecast.  \n- Research assistant input: No additional information available beyond the provided background; hence the estimate relies on recent observed cadence and typical event-driven patterns.  \nWhy not higher: No concrete, public indications of an imminent June signing; potential summer scheduling frictions; and the possibility that the next signing slips into July.  \nWhy not lower: Clear recent momentum (two signings in April–May), many remaining plausible candidates, and likely June diplomatic venues.  \nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting or official statements that a specific country plans to sign in June; inclusion of a signing on official event calendars; leaks from State/NASA or partner ministries.  \nWhat would move me down: Signals that key June events lack diplomatic signings; postponements of expected bilateral meetings; statements from likely candidates indicating delays or re-evaluation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025. There are 55 signatories at the time of this question: Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay. [(source)](https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-oceans-and-international-environmental-and-scientific-affairs/artemis-accords)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country becomes an Artemis Accord signatory after May 30, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
