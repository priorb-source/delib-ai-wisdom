  "information": "According to a March 25, 2025 report, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) denied reports of plans to suspend Starlink's satellite broadband service. The TRCSL Director General stated that a 'dashboard system' is required to regulate the service and that its implementation had been delayed. The Director General mentioned that the service was expected to become operational in April 2025 once the necessary systems were in place.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, the Starlink map does not show Sri Lanka as 'Available.' If this does not change, the outcome will be No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The implementation of the 'dashboard system' required by the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) faces further delays. This bureaucratic or technical hurdle is not resolved before the deadline, preventing Starlink from launching the service and updating its map.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The TRCSL and Starlink resolve the final regulatory requirements concerning the 'dashboard system' in the coming weeks. With final approval granted, Starlink activates its service for Sri Lanka and updates its public availability map to 'Available' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The forecast weighs the initial positive momentum against recent evidence of delays. The granting of a license to Starlink in August 2024 was a significant positive step, indicating high-level government approval. However, information from March 2025 reveals that the project is now delayed pending the implementation of a regulatory 'dashboard system.' The TRCSL's expectation for an April 2025 launch has already been missed, which is a key negative indicator suggesting the remaining hurdles are more complex than anticipated. The status quo outcome is 'No,' and with only 1.5 months remaining, inertia favors this outcome. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the project is already behind its most recently stated schedule. Short-term forecasting is difficult, and delays often lead to further delays. The specific nature of the technical hurdle is unknown and could be complex.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the primary obstacle—obtaining the license—has been overcome. The issue is described as a technical/regulatory implementation detail, not a fundamental deal-breaker. The TRCSL has also actively denied rumors of a service suspension, indicating the project is still moving forward. An agreement could be reached at any time, and Starlink is capable of rapidly updating its service status. \n\nI would increase my probability forecast upon news of a finalized agreement on the dashboard system or a specific launch announcement from either Starlink or the TRCSL. Conversely, I would decrease it if reports of new complications emerge or if the end of June nears with no change in status.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Sri Lanka as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Musk's Starlink wins Sri Lanka licence](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/sri-lanka-regulator-grants-licence-musks-starlink-satellite-broadband-2024-08-13/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Sri Lanka listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to a March 25, 2025 report, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) denied reports of plans to suspend Starlink's satellite broadband service. The TRCSL Director General stated that a 'dashboard system' is required to regulate the service and that its implementation had been delayed.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
