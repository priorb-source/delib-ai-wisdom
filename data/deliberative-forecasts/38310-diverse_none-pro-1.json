    "review": "The other two forecasters and I share a common assessment of the fundamental factors at play: the strong precedent of President Zelenskyy's in-person attendance at the 2023 and 2024 summits, the critical importance of the G7 for securing Ukrainian support, and the formal invitation from the host nation, Canada. Our primary point of divergence is the weight we assign to the risks that could lead to a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 2's reminder that Zelenskyy has a history of last-minute trip cancellations due to security or battlefield developments is a salient point. Forecaster 3 raised an argument I had not sufficiently considered: the possibility of a strategic shift to virtual participation. This represents a plausible 'soft no' scenario, where Zelenskyy still engages with the G7 leaders but does not physically attend, perhaps due to a moderately worsened security situation that does not rise to the level of a full-blown crisis. This is a more nuanced and potentially more probable path to a 'No' resolution than the catastrophic events I had primarily focused on.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 90% was based on the overwhelming diplomatic incentives and the recent base rate of in-person attendance at top-tier summits. I viewed the primary risk as a major, last-minute military or security crisis that would make travel impossible. The deliberations have convinced me that my view of the 'No' scenarios was too narrow. The arguments from the other forecasters, particularly the potential for a deliberate switch to virtual attendance as a viable alternative (which still resolves this question as 'No'), are persuasive. This expands the set of conditions under which Zelenskyy might not attend in person beyond just severe emergencies. While I still believe the pull for in-person attendance is immense due to the value of personal diplomacy, the other analysts have rightly pointed out that the operational environment is volatile and provides for more varied outcomes. Acknowledging this increased uncertainty and the broader range of paths to a 'No' outcome, I am lowering my forecast. I am moving down 5 percentage points to 85%, which I believe better reflects the non-trivial, though still unlikely, risk that wartime conditions or strategic calculations lead to him participating remotely or cancelling.",
