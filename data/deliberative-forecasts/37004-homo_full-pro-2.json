    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, identified the same key evidence and reached a similar conclusion: a Conservative popular vote win is a low-probability event. We all centered our analysis on the consistent 5-7 point lead for the Liberal party across multiple late-campaign polls. We also all identified the same two primary counterarguments: the potential for a turnout differential favoring the Conservatives due to higher voter commitment, and the possibility of a systemic polling error. The other two forecasters did not introduce new evidence, but their convergence on a slightly higher probability (15%) than my initial forecast (12%) prompted me to reconsider the weight I assigned to these uncertainty factors. Their reasoning that these factors, while individually unlikely to bridge the entire gap, could combine to create an upset is convincing.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 12%, anchored heavily on the magnitude and consistency of the Liberal lead in the polls. While I acknowledged the potential for a turnout differential and polling error, the consensus of the other forecasters at 15% has persuaded me to give these factors slightly more weight. The 13-point gap in 'very committed' voters (76% for Conservatives vs. 63% for Liberals) is significant and could plausibly account for a 1-2 point boost for the Conservatives on election day, which isn't fully captured by polls. If that happens, the required polling error to flip the result shrinks from an exceptional 5-7 points to a more plausible, though still large, 3-5 points. The combination of these two events remains unlikely, but my initial forecast may have understated this possibility. I am therefore updating my forecast upwards by three percentage points to align with the other experts, reflecting a greater appreciation for the combined impact of these two key sources of uncertainty.",
