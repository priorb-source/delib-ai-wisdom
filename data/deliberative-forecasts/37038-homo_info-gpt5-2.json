    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds concrete, testable details I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: a specific Chapter 99 entry (9903.01.48), effective date (Apr 9), a 90‑day suspension window to July 9, and that the HTS website already displays “+17%” for Israel with a suspended flag. That directly addresses my earlier uncertainty about whether the HTS would visibly show a +17% Israel adder in a way that meets the resolution criterion. Forecaster 3’s analysis appears to miss these developments; while their point about Chapter 99 implementation is correct in general, their low probability hinges on the assumption that such an entry doesn’t exist yet, which conflicts with F2’s specifics and the RA’s timeline. Overall, F2’s argument is more compelling and consistent with current practice and the stated suspension period.",
    "rationale": "The decisive consideration is whether the HTS will still show a +17% duty for Israel on or after June 1, regardless of suspension. Given the reported existence of 9903.01.48 already visible on hts.usitc.gov with “+17%” for Israel, the baseline is that the listing remains through June 1, especially since the suspension runs to July 9. The main route to a No is an early diplomatic resolution and presidential proclamation in May that revokes or materially alters the measure and prompts USITC to remove or rewrite the listing before June 1. That risk is real given active negotiations, but timing and typical publishing cadence make it less likely than continuity through early June. I’m therefore moving up from 70% to reflect reduced uncertainty about the HTS display and the explicit irrelevance of suspension to resolution, while keeping a meaningful discount for a pre–June 1 revocation/update scenario.",
