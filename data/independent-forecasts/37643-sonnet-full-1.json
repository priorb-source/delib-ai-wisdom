  "information": "An executive order signed on March 7, 2025, aims to limit eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program by altering the definition of 'public service'. The order directs the Department of Education and the Treasury Department to propose regulatory changes to make certain public-sector employees ineligible. Additionally, a provision within the House GOP's 2025 tax bill would grant the U.S. Treasury Secretary the authority to revoke the tax-exempt status of non-profits designated as 'terrorist supporting organizations,' which would disqualify their employees from the PSLF program.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education is establishing a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee, named the Student Loans and Affordability Committee, tasked with developing proposed regulations for federal student aid programs. A key focus of this committee will be to refine the definition of qualifying employers for Public Service Loan Forgiveness eligibility. The deadline for nominations for negotiators was June 1, 2025, and the committee is scheduled to hold its first session from June 30 to July 2, 2025, with proposed and final rules anticipated for release later in 2025.\n\nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is established by federal statute, specifically Section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act (codified at 20 U.S.C. §1087e(m)). Consequently, terminating the program is generally understood to require a new act of Congress. Unilateral executive action to end the program is considered to have uncertain legal standing and would require, at a minimum, a formal notice-of-proposed-rulemaking process, including a public comment period, before any changes could be finalized.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 48 days, until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The objective remains marked as 'in progress' and the question resolves as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Negotiated Rulemaking Committee holds its first session on June 30-July 2, 2025, as scheduled, but no proposed rules are finalized. The executive order from March 7, 2025, continues limiting eligibility but does not fully terminate the program. No Congressional legislation passes to end PSLF. The Keep_Track moderators determine that, while progress has been made toward limiting the program, it has not been fully terminated and therefore keep the status as 'in progress' through July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Congress rapidly passes legislation in May or June that statutorily terminates the PSLF program, and the President signs it. Alternatively, the administration takes aggressive administrative action that the Keep_Track moderators interpret as effectively terminating the program (such as making eligibility requirements so restrictive that virtually no one qualifies), and they mark the objective as 'complete' even before formal rulemaking is finalized.",
    "rationale": "The timeline is extremely compressed with only 48 days remaining. Several factors strongly suggest the status quo will persist: (1) The PSLF program is established by federal statute, meaning true termination requires Congressional action, which typically takes months; (2) The Negotiated Rulemaking Committee's first session is scheduled for June 30-July 2, literally at the resolution deadline, meaning proposed rules won't be drafted, let alone finalized, by July 1; (3) Even executive actions require notice-of-proposed-rulemaking and public comment periods; (4) The March 7 executive order only limits eligibility rather than terminating the program. The key uncertainty is how the Keep_Track moderators define 'complete.' If they interpret significant administrative restrictions as effectively terminating the program, the probability would be higher. However, given their tracking methodology appears to distinguish between 'in progress' and 'complete,' they likely require substantial evidence of program termination. For this forecast to be higher, I would need evidence of imminent Congressional action or indication that Keep_Track uses a loose definition of 'complete.' For it to be lower, I would need absolute certainty about their criteria, which I lack.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
