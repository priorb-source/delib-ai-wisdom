    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (until July 1, 2025)",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "Appropriations or executive actions remain proposed/contested, with no enacted law or clearly effective, durable halt to CPB/PBS-related funding by July 1. The spreadsheet maintainers keep the item at in progress or similar.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before July 1, Congress enacts and the President signs legislation that zeroes out or otherwise stops federal funding that supports PBS/NPR (e.g., CPB), and the Keep_Track spreadsheet is updated to mark the objective complete; or the administration successfully halts outlays in a way the tracker deems sufficient to count as stopping funding and they update the sheet accordingly before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: The item is currently marked in progress. With ~45 days left, large, durable fiscal changes typically require enacted appropriations or a clearly effective funding halt. The appropriations cycle and legal constraints on impoundment make a definitive stoppage before July 1 unlikely. Community trackers also tend to be cautious about marking completion absent enacted and operative policy.\n- Legislative/administrative feasibility: Defunding CPB/PBS has been proposed many times, but bipartisan resistance has historically prevented full elimination. Even under favorable political alignment, moving from proposal to signed law by early summer—well ahead of typical FY2026 deadlines—is a heavy lift. Executive-only attempts to halt funding would face the Impoundment Control Act and litigation; trackers would likely classify such moves as attempts/in progress rather than complete unless funds are actually stopped.\n- Process/timing risk: Even if a House bill zeroing funds emerges in June, Senate action and reconciliation before July 1 is improbable. Additionally, the spreadsheet relies on volunteer updates; any lag would bias toward No given the resolution rule requires the complete status before July 1.\n- Why not higher? Because achieving and documenting a definitive funding stop within 45 days is unlikely given legislative timelines, legal hurdles to impoundment, and the tracker’s apparent caution (currently in progress).\n- Why not lower? A small chance remains that a rapid enactment or a decisive, effectively binding funding halt occurs and the tracker promptly marks it complete; or the maintainers adopt a more permissive criterion (e.g., counting sustained executive blocking of outlays as stopping funding) and update quickly.\n- What would change my forecast upward: Evidence that (1) an enacted law before July 1 has zeroed CPB/PBS-related funding, (2) a legally effective halt to disbursements is in place and recognized by credible sources, and/or (3) the spreadsheet has been updated more aggressively in similar cases, counting non-enacted but effectively implemented actions as complete.\n- What would lower it: Signals that appropriations protect CPB funding through the relevant period, court rulings blocking any attempted funding freezes, or the spreadsheet maintainers explicitly requiring enacted law and indicating they will not update until much later.\n- Research assistant info: None beyond the prompt; no contrary indications surfaced.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"stop funding for NPR and PBS\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
