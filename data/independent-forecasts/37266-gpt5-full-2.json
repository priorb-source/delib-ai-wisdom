  "information": "The U.S. State Department's travel advisory for Mozambique is currently 'Level 3: Reconsider Travel,' as of the last update on December 19, 2023. Specific northern regions of the country are under higher-level warnings. Recent security developments include suspected jihadist attacks in late April and early May 2025 in Niassa province, an area previously less impacted by the insurgency centered in Cabo Delgado. In response, the U.S. Embassy in Maputo issued specific warnings. The UK and Canada have also warned against travel to parts of Niassa and Cabo Delgado. Concurrently, ongoing post-election protests have led the African Travel & Tourism Association (ATTA) to issue its own travel advisory.\n\nThe U.S. State Department uses a four-level travel advisory system. Level 1 is 'Exercise Normal Precautions.' Level 2 is 'Exercise Increased Caution,' for heightened safety and security risks. Level 3, 'Reconsider Travel,' signifies serious risks. Level 4, 'Do Not Travel,' is the highest level, typically applied in cases of widespread violent conflict, civil war, uncontrolled crime, risk of wrongful detention, or severe breakdowns in national infrastructure. The advisories are determined based on factors including crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and health concerns. The State Department reviews advisories for Level 3 and 4 countries at least every six months.\n\nAs of early May 2025, the U.S. State Department has 'Level 4: Do Not Travel' advisories in effect for 21 countries. Reasons for these advisories include active conflicts, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and health emergencies. The list of countries includes Afghanistan, Belarus, Burkina Faso, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen. Some advisories have been updated recently; the advisory for South Sudan was elevated to Level 4 on March 8, 2025. In other instances, advisories are applied regionally, such as in Bangladesh, which has a country-wide Level 3 advisory but a Level 4 warning for the Chittagong Hill Tracts region.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Mozambique remains at Level 3: Reconsider Travel, with any heightened risk handled via regional Level 4 warnings rather than a countrywide Level 4.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security incidents remain concentrated in the north (Cabo Delgado/Niassa) with occasional flare-ups but no sustained nationwide deterioration. The State Department updates the page but maintains Level 3 overall, possibly expanding or refining region-specific Level 4 restrictions if needed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp, nationwide deterioration: sustained insurgent activity spreads into additional provinces or major cities; notable attacks or kidnappings affecting foreigners; severe, widespread civil unrest or government security posture changes (e.g., curfews, state of emergency); or the Embassy orders departure of non‑emergency staff—prompting a countrywide Level 4.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The U.S. advisory is currently Level 3 for Mozambique. The U.S. typically reserves countrywide Level 4 advisories for the most acute environments (widespread conflict, extreme civil unrest, systemic kidnapping/terrorism risk across much of the country, wrongful detentions, or severe health crises). As of early May 2025, about 21 countries hold Level 4—places like Sudan, South Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, etc.—which are experiencing significantly higher and more generalized risk than Mozambique.\n\nRecent developments: There were suspected jihadist attacks in late April/early May 2025 in Niassa, and the U.S. Embassy issued warnings. The UK and Canada have also cautioned against travel to parts of Niassa and Cabo Delgado. ATTA has flagged protest-related risks. These are meaningful signals of elevated localized risk, but they do not yet suggest nationwide breakdown. Historically for Mozambique, the State Department has addressed northern-province risks with region-specific Level 4 guidance while keeping the national advisory at Level 3.\n\nProcess and timing: The State Department can update advisories at any time and reviews higher-risk countries at least every six months, but a review doesn’t imply an upgrade. With only ~60 days left, a countrywide jump to Level 4 would likely require a conspicuous inflection: multiple high-profile attacks outside the far north, major incidents in Maputo or key transit corridors, a spike in kidnappings targeting foreigners, or Embassy measures such as ordering departure or severe movement restrictions.\n\nWhy not higher: The base rate of Level 3 countries moving to Level 4 within a two‑month window is low, and Mozambique’s risks remain geographically concentrated. The U.S. pattern is to use regional Level 4s rather than a national Level 4 when the threat is localized.\n\nWhy not lower: The insurgency’s apparent spread into Niassa and ongoing post‑election tensions raise the tail risk of a sharper deterioration. Embassy alerts show active concern, so a sudden escalation can’t be ruled out.\n\nWhat would move me up: Evidence of sustained attacks beyond the north (e.g., in Nampula, Zambezia, or southern/central corridors), a major incident in Maputo or tourist hubs, kidnappings of foreigners, Embassy ordered departure/suspension of services, or allies (UK/Canada) moving to nationwide ‘Do Not Travel.’\n\nWhat would move me down: Several quiet weeks with contained incidents in the north, no Embassy movement restrictions or evacuation steps, and partner advisories remaining regional rather than nationwide.",
