    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a crucial point I significantly underweighted: the threshold is extremely low - requiring only ANY increase above $262,578M. With typical inflation of 2-3%, nominal exports would naturally rise by $5-8 billion just from price effects, even with flat volumes. This creates a strong baseline for a Yes resolution. Historical data supports this: nominal year-over-year export declines are relatively rare outside major crises. Forecaster 2's emphasis on timing lags and nominal vs. real distinctions is also important - April may be too early for full retaliatory effects. However, I find Forecaster 3's 60% slightly optimistic given the prominent tariff context. For No to occur, tariff impacts would need to be severe enough to overcome the ~2-3% inflation lift AND cause actual nominal decline. While possible with comprehensive retaliation and dollar strength, this requires multiple negative factors aligning. Forecaster 2's 35% seems too pessimistic given the inflation baseline and low threshold.",
    "rationale": "My original 40% forecast underweighted two critical factors: (1) the very low threshold requiring minimal nominal growth, and (2) the powerful inflation tailwind of 2-3% that provides $5-8 billion baseline lift. For this to resolve No, April 2025 exports must be at or below $262,578M - essentially requiring nominal stagnation or decline. While Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs and likely retaliation create significant headwinds, achieving actual nominal export decline requires overcoming inflation and typically happens only during major crises or with severe dollar appreciation. The 2018-2019 trade war saw export volatility but not consistent nominal declines. Key risks pushing toward No: swift comprehensive retaliation, strong dollar appreciation, severe business uncertainty. Key factors supporting Yes: inflation baseline, timing lags in trade war effects, front-loading behavior, dollar weakness possibilities. Balancing the low threshold and inflation support against meaningful tariff risks, I'm updating upward but remaining below Forecaster 3's optimism.",
