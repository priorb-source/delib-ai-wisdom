    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days until July 1, 2025, when the National UFO Reporting Center data for June 2025 will be accessed to determine the outcome. Note: The question title mentions March 2025, but the resolution criteria clearly specify June 2025, which has not yet occurred.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Without access to historical data on state-by-state pilot UFO sightings, the status quo is uncertain. However, given that this asks if Florida will rank first among all 50 US states for a specific category in a single month, the default expectation would be 'No' - that some other state will lead or Florida will tie.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "California, Texas, Arizona, or another state with high air traffic and military aviation activity reports more pilot UFO sightings than Florida in June 2025. Alternatively, Florida ties with another state for the most sightings, which also resolves as No per the resolution criteria.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Florida experiences an unusual cluster of pilot UFO sightings in June 2025, potentially due to military exercises, unusual weather phenomena misidentified as UAPs, or genuine anomalous sightings. Florida's combination of year-round flying weather, commercial hub airports, military presence, and coastal areas results in it having strictly more pilot reports than any other state.",
    "rationale": "This question requires Florida to rank first among all 50 states in a specific reporting category for a single month. Key factors favoring Florida include significant commercial aviation (major hubs in Miami, Orlando, Tampa), substantial military aviation presence (Eglin AFB, Tyndall AFB, Naval Air Stations), year-round flying weather, and a large general aviation community. However, multiple states compete for this distinction: California has the largest aviation market, Texas has multiple major metropolitan areas with substantial air traffic, and Arizona/Nevada have significant military aviation and testing ranges. The question is made more stringent by the requirement that Florida have MORE sightings than any other state - ties count as No. Without historical baseline data showing Florida typically leads in pilot UFO sightings, I must assume roughly equal probability among the 5-8 most aviation-heavy states. The single-month timeframe introduces randomness - one notable incident or cluster of sightings could shift leadership to any competitive state. My forecast is not higher because: (1) no evidence Florida historically dominates this category, (2) strong competition from other major aviation states, (3) ties resolve as No, making the threshold stricter. My forecast is not lower because: (1) Florida is plausibly competitive given its aviation characteristics, (2) monthly data introduces randomness that could favor any competitive state, (3) Florida's military and commercial aviation presence is substantial. I would update higher with evidence that Florida historically leads in pilot sightings or news of unusual activity in Florida airspace. I would update lower with evidence that other states consistently dominate or that Florida rarely places first.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
