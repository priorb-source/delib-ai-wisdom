  "information": "Based on its Q4 Fiscal Year 2025 results (for the quarter ending January 31, 2025), ChargePoint reported having $225.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The company's operating cash usage decreased to $3 million in Q4, down from $31 million in the previous quarter. The non-GAAP gross margin improved to 30%. While overall Q4 revenue declined 12% year-over-year, subscription revenue grew by 14% to $38 million. The company has no debt maturities until 2028. For Q1 of Fiscal Year 2026, ChargePoint guided for revenues between $95 million and $105 million.\n\nOn February 19, 2025, ChargePoint received a notice of non-compliance from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The notice was issued because the company's average closing stock price remained below $1.00 over a consecutive 30-day trading period. This notification does not result in an immediate delisting. The company has publicly stated its intention to cure the stock price deficiency and regain compliance, and is considering measures such as a reverse stock split, which would be subject to stockholder approval.\n\nIn February 2025, it was reported that the U.S. federal government had paused $3 billion in funding designated for EV charging stations. Separately, on May 1, 2025, ChargePoint announced it had secured over $19 million in funding from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to build charging stations in California. The company is also launching a new AC Level 2 charging technology with bidirectional capabilities, scheduled for release in Europe by summer 2025 and in North America by the end of 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The company continues to operate using its existing cash reserves while managing its cash burn.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint continues its operations, managing its cash burn rate effectively. Its cash reserves of over $200 million are sufficient to cover operating expenses well beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline, and no acute liquidity crisis emerges.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unforeseen catastrophic event occurs, such as a massive product recall, a major lawsuit resulting in a significant immediate liability, or a sudden and complete collapse of credit lines, which rapidly depletes the company's cash reserves and forces an emergency bankruptcy filing.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly driven by ChargePoint's current liquidity position relative to the very short time frame of the question. The most critical data points from the Q4 fiscal year 2025 report (ending Jan 31, 2025) are the $225.6 million in cash and the dramatic reduction in operating cash usage to just $3 million for the quarter. This cash position provides a substantial buffer against operational needs. Even if the cash burn were to revert to a higher level, such as the previous quarter's $31 million, the company would still have more than enough runway to last well past July 1, 2025. Furthermore, the company has no debt maturities until 2028, which removes the immediate risk of a default or debt-related liquidity crisis. The negative factors, such as the NYSE non-compliance notice and paused federal funding, are significant long-term headwinds but do not pose an imminent threat to solvency within the next seven weeks. The NYSE delisting process has a cure period, and is not an immediate trigger for bankruptcy. While the operating environment is challenging, the company's financial state provides a clear path to survival in the short term.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 3% because there is always a non-zero tail risk of a 'black swan' event, such as a sudden market collapse, a major undisclosed liability, or corporate malfeasance that could trigger a sudden crisis of confidence and a run on the company.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 3% because a higher probability would imply a plausible path to insolvency in the next two months. Given the company's substantial cash reserves, reduced burn rate, and lack of near-term debt maturities, such a path is not apparent from the available public information.\n\nI would increase my probability if ChargePoint's upcoming Q1 earnings report (for the quarter ending April 30, 2025) reveals a shocking and drastic re-acceleration of cash burn, a significant deterioration of their cash position, or the announcement of a major, unreserved liability. I would decrease my probability if that same report confirms continued low cash burn and a stable or growing cash position.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if ChargePoint Holdings, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
