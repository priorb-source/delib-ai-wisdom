    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - The status quo suggests there are currently 5 or fewer direct flight destinations from Koror, given that the background indicates tourism and flights haven't recovered to pre-pandemic levels",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Flight routes remain stable at current levels with no new destinations added. The slow tourism recovery continues, and airlines maintain their cautious approach to the Palau market. By July 1, 2025, there are still 5 or fewer direct destinations from Koror.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Tourism recovery accelerates faster than expected in the final weeks of the question period, or new seasonal summer routes are launched in June 2025. Airlines add one or more new direct destinations, bringing the total to 6 or more by July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The critical constraint is the very short timeframe - only 41 days until resolution. Major airline route additions typically require months of advance planning, regulatory approval, marketing, and scheduling. The background article from April 2024 indicates structural challenges with tourism recovery and flight service remaining below pre-pandemic levels. For the resolution to be YES, one of two conditions must be true: (1) there are already 6+ destinations currently scheduled/operating that will continue through July 1, or (2) new routes will be announced and commence within the next 6 weeks. Given the negative tone of the background information about slow recovery and the fact that my research assistant found no additional information suggesting imminent route additions, the status quo of limited destinations is most likely. The threshold of 'greater than 5' (meaning 6+) appears calibrated to be moderately challenging. Without current data on exact destination counts, I'm relying heavily on: (a) the framing suggesting limited service, (b) the short timeframe making changes unlikely, and (c) typical airline planning cycles. My forecast would be higher if there were evidence of recently announced routes or confirmed summer seasonal expansion. It would be lower if I had definitive data showing only 3-4 current destinations with no expansion plans.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 5 direct flight destinations from Koror, Palau on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMarketplace: [Why hasn’t tourism recovered in Palau? Flights haven’t restarted in high volume since the pandemic drop-off, and South Koreans are booking their vacations elsewhere.](https://www.marketplace.org/story/2024/04/19/palau-tourism)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 5 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Koror (ROR)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/ROR) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
