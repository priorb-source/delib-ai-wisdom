  "information": "Protests have been ongoing in Turkey since the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu on March 19, 2025, on corruption charges. Reports from various news outlets cited turnouts in the hundreds of thousands. The Republican People's Party (CHP) claimed that over 2 million people participated in a protest in Istanbul on March 29. The party announced plans for continued protests. Following the initial wave of demonstrations, Turkish authorities detained 1,133 people between March 19 and March 23. In response to the protests, nearly 1,900 people, including journalists, had been rounded up by late March.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, Labor Day events in Istanbul included authorized marches and unauthorized protests. According to the Istanbul Governor's Office, authorized marches in the Kadıköy and Kartal districts had a combined participation of around 65,000 people. Authorities deployed over 52,000 police officers. Clashes occurred during attempts to hold unauthorized demonstrations, particularly near Taksim Square, leading to the detention of 384 people. A court later ordered the release of 374 of those detained, while others were released on bail or remained in custody.\n\nTurkey's high inflation rate was reported at approximately 48.6% in early 2025. In the legal sphere, an indictment was prepared for 14 youths arrested during the Saraçhane protests, with their first hearing scheduled for May 30, 2025. Separately, the trial for manager Ayşe Barım, related to her alleged role in the 2013 Gezi Park protests, is scheduled for July 7, 2025. Amnesty International's 2024-25 report highlighted what it described as human rights violations in Turkey, including restrictions on peaceful protests and the prosecution of journalists and opposition figures. The organization also condemned the arrests made ahead of the May 1st protests and called for the lifting of the ban on demonstrations in Taksim Square.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "54 days (until July 1, 2025, from current date of May 7, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - The Global Protest Tracker has not yet reported any Turkish protests with 10,000+ participants, despite major protests occurring",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker does not report any Turkish protests with 10,000+ participants before July 1, 2025. This could occur if: the tracker has specific criteria that exclude the March-May protests (e.g., only covering unauthorized protests, or having verification challenges with participant counts), there are systematic delays or gaps in their Turkey coverage, or new protests fail to materialize and previous ones remain unreported",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker reports on the March-May 2025 protests that have already occurred (which clearly had 10,000+ participants, with reports of hundreds of thousands and authorized May 1 marches with 65,000 participants), or reports on new large protests that occur between now and July 1. Given ongoing political tensions and planned CHP protests, additional large demonstrations are plausible",
    "rationale": "The central issue is not whether large protests are occurring in Turkey - they clearly are, with massive participation numbers. The March 29 protest allegedly had over 2 million participants according to CHP, and May 1 authorized marches alone had 65,000 participants. The question hinges on whether the Global Protest Tracker will report these events. The fact that the criteria 'have not yet been satisfied' despite these massive protests suggests either: (1) significant reporting lag in the tracker's methodology, (2) specific inclusion criteria that may exclude certain protests, or (3) verification processes that take time. Factors supporting a Yes outcome: clear evidence of multiple large protests already occurring, continued political tensions (48.6% inflation, opposition arrests), planned future protests by CHP, and 54 days remaining for the tracker to update. Factors supporting a No outcome: the puzzling absence of reports despite major protests, uncertainty about the tracker's coverage of Turkey, possible selection criteria we're unaware of. The authorized nature of some protests (May 1) versus unauthorized ones might matter to their methodology. I weight this at 72% because while massive protests have clearly occurred with participation far exceeding 10,000, the unexplained absence of tracker reporting introduces uncertainty about their practices. For my forecast to increase, I'd need evidence the tracker typically covers Turkish protests or confirmation they'll report on recent events. For it to decrease, I'd need evidence of systematic exclusion criteria or cessation of protest activity",
