    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 24 days (until 2025-06-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the FSIS recall page remains listed as Active through May and into June 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS effectiveness checks or product accounting aren’t fully completed (or documented) by late May, or the page update lags, so the status remains Active on/after June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "This small, geographically limited recall (vending machines in Washington) completes effectiveness checks and product reconciliation; FSIS updates the recall status to Closed in May (potentially already done).",
    "rationale": "Timing: The recall was issued Feb 24, 2025, giving roughly 97 days until June 1. Many FSIS recalls—especially small, limited-distribution allergen/misbranding events—tend to be closed within 1–3 months once effectiveness checks and product reconciliation are done. Ready-to-eat wraps likely had short shelf life; distribution via vending machines suggests a small number of points to check, both of which favor a relatively quick closure. We are currently about 10+ weeks post-issuance, so a closure by late May is plausible.\nStatus-quo weight: If nothing changes, it stays Active and resolves No. However, given elapsed time and small scope, the base rate favors closure in this window. I overweight the status quo somewhat due to FSIS process/administrative lag risk, but the specifics here (limited distribution, short-dated product) pull the probability up.\nWhy not higher: Administrative delays or lingering verification steps can keep pages Active for months, even after product ages out. The resolution requires the status to change before June 1 (closures on/after June 1 won’t count). A small chance exists of broader distribution than reported or slow documentation.\nWhy not lower: The recall’s limited scope and short shelf life make prolonged activity less likely; many comparable FSIS allergen/misbranding recalls close within 60–100 days.\nUpdates that would shift me: Up if the FSIS page shows Closed or if similar 2025 small-scope recalls are being closed within ~8–12 weeks; down if the page remains Active into the last week of May, or if FSIS posts expanded distribution/volume or ongoing effectiveness checks. The research assistant found no new info, so the estimate rests on base rates and the recall’s limited scope and elapsed time.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
