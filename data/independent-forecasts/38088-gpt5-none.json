    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 250th spot remains occupied by a non-U.S. billionaire (e.g., European, Chinese, Indian) due to typical churn around the threshold and/or continued relative strength of U.S. equities pushing U.S. billionaires away from the median rank.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Normal day-to-day moves shuffle the mid-list and, by July 1, a U.S. billionaire happens to sit at #250—possibly due to slight underperformance of U.S. names relative to others near that threshold or idiosyncratic revaluations/new additions/removals that place a U.S. person exactly at the median.",
    "rationale": "Time horizon is short and the index near rank ~250 is volatile day-to-day. On April 30, #250 was Giancarlo Devasini (Italy), so the immediate status quo points to No. However, the U.S. has the single largest share of billionaires globally, and Bloomberg’s top-500 tends to skew U.S.-heavy versus most other countries, implying that the nationality at any given single rank is roughly a 35–45% chance to be American in the 200–300 band. Over a month, that rank will likely change hands multiple times, so I put less weight than usual on today’s specific non-U.S. occupant, though I still tilt slightly against Yes because current observation is non-U.S. and because U.S. equity strength would, if anything, tend to lift U.S. fortunes out of the median slot rather than into it. \n\nKey considerations:\n- Composition: U.S. remains the largest cohort among billionaires; in the mid-ranks this likely translates to a roughly 35–45% baseline chance for the #250 being U.S. on any given day.\n- Short horizon with high churn: Daily market moves and occasional list adjustments frequently reshuffle ranks around 250, making the eventual nationality close to the local composition share rather than tightly anchored to today’s name.\n- Status quo weighting: Current #250 is Italian (non-U.S.), nudging the probability a bit below the midpoint of the 35–45% range.\n\nWhy not higher? If U.S. equities keep outperforming into late June, U.S. billionaires may be pulled upward from the median region, modestly reducing the chance the exact #250 is American. Also, the global billionaire population is widely distributed; even with U.S. dominance overall, a single rank’s nationality is effectively a coin flip biased only modestly toward the largest cohort.\n\nWhy not lower? The U.S. still has the largest representation, and the list’s midsection includes many Americans. One month is enough time for several turnovers at #250, so a U.S. name landing there by July 1 isn’t rare.\n\nUpdates that would move me: \n- Upward: Evidence by late June that U.S. names are clustering near the 240–260 band (e.g., a relative dip in U.S. markets vs. others, or idiosyncratic markdowns of U.S. private assets) increasing the density of Americans around #250; or observing a U.S. person at #250 in the few days leading into July 1.\n- Downward: Continued outperformance in U.S. tech/mega-cap pushing U.S. mid-rankers higher; a rebound in non-U.S. markets (e.g., China/Europe/India) increasing non-U.S. density around #250; or a non-U.S. occupant holding #250 for many consecutive days near the deadline.\n\nResearch assistant summary: No additional information available; forecast relies on general composition patterns and typical volatility of the index.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked name on the list was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025. It resolves as **No** if the 250th-ranked person is from any other country.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the \"median\" from the question's title is defined as the 250th ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, no matter how many are on the list.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
