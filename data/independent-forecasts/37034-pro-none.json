    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About five weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Oil and gas prices remain relatively stable, leading producers to maintain their current drilling programs. The recent trend of a very slow decline or stabilization in the rig count continues, and the total number of active rigs remains above 583 by the end of May 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A drop in commodity prices, particularly a fall in WTI crude below $75 per barrel, prompts producers to accelerate rig count reductions. Alternatively, the realization of post-merger efficiencies and continued poor natural gas economics lead to a faster-than-expected decline, pushing the count below the 583 threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an analysis of the current rig count trend, key economic drivers, and the short time horizon until the question resolves. \n\nStarting with the baseline, extrapolating from the slow decline seen through 2024 and the subsequent stability, I estimate the rig count as of late April 2025 to be approximately 605. This is significantly above the threshold of 583. For the question to resolve as 'Yes', the count must fall by at least 22 rigs over the next five weeks, an average decline of over 4 rigs per week. \n\nThis required rate of decline is much faster than the trend observed in early 2024, which showed remarkable stability with very small weekly changes. The primary factor supporting the current rig count is the relatively strong price of WTI crude oil, which provides a floor for drilling activity. This makes a rapid drop unlikely and favors a 'No' outcome. \n\nHowever, there are persistent downward pressures. Structural trends like industry consolidation (M&A) and a focus on capital discipline over production growth tend to reduce the number of active rigs. Furthermore, persistently low natural gas prices are weighing on gas-directed drilling. These factors make a continued, albeit slow, decline probable. My research assistant provided no additional information to sway the forecast. \n\nMy probability of 25% is not lower because these underlying downward pressures, combined with the potential for a negative oil price shock, create a plausible path for an accelerated decline. A drop of 22 rigs in 5 weeks is not unprecedented. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the current stability is a strong signal. With oil prices at profitable levels, there is little incentive for producers to enact the kind of rapid cuts needed to fall below the threshold in such a short timeframe. \n\nI would increase my probability if WTI crude prices fall decisively below $75/barrel or if the first few weekly reports in May show larger-than-expected declines. Conversely, I would decrease my probability if oil prices rise further or if the rig count remains flat in the coming weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive. If no such report exists, this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
