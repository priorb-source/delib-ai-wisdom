  "information": "Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and Palestinian activist, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March 2025. An immigration judge subsequently ruled that he can be deported, concluding that the government had met its burden to prove grounds for deportation based on national security and foreign policy concerns. Khalil's legal team is appealing this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and has also filed a separate habeas corpus petition in federal court, arguing that the government's actions violate his First Amendment rights.\n\nOn May 11, 2025, a federal judge in New Jersey extended a temporary restraining order (TRO) that bars ICE from deporting Mahmoud Khalil. The extension was granted because the court found Khalil’s First-Amendment and Administrative Procedure Act claims to be “plausible.” Further legal briefings have been scheduled, and TROs that are extended typically remain in effect until a court rules on a motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe case occurs within a broader context of the Trump administration's actions against individuals involved in pro-Palestinian activism. Reports indicate that since January 2025, the administration has revoked visas for over 1,000 foreign university students. Additionally, the Zionist organization Betar US announced it is working with the administration to help deport demonstrators it considers a threat, and has publicly named Mahmoud Khalil in its statements. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also written that allowing Khalil to remain in the country would create a “hostile environment for Jewish students.”",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current status is that a federal judge has issued and extended a temporary restraining order (TRO) barring Mahmoud Khalil's deportation. So long as this or a subsequent injunction remains in place, he cannot be deported.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The federal court's temporary restraining order remains in effect, or is converted into a preliminary injunction, extending past July 1, 2025. Alternatively, even if the TRO is lifted, the ongoing appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) or other legal maneuvers prevent the government from physically removing Khalil from the U.S. before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The federal court quickly rules against Khalil and dissolves the temporary restraining order in the coming weeks. The government, under intense political pressure, then prioritizes his case and successfully expedites his physical deportation before his legal team can obtain a stay from a higher court, all before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the timeline and the significant legal obstacles preventing immediate deportation. The most critical factor is the temporary restraining order (TRO) issued by a federal judge, which was recently extended. A federal judge found Khalil's First Amendment claims 'plausible,' indicating the case has legal merit and is unlikely to be dismissed summarily. Legal proceedings, especially those involving constitutional claims and appeals to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), are notoriously slow. The remaining period of approximately 47 days is a very short window for the federal court to deny a preliminary injunction, for any subsequent appeals for a stay to fail, and for ICE to execute the physical removal.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 10% because of the immense political pressure from the Trump administration, as evidenced by Secretary of State Rubio's statements and the actions of groups like Betar US. This strong executive branch intent means that if a legal opportunity arises—such as a sudden denial of the preliminary injunction—ICE will likely act with maximum speed to carry out the deportation before another legal barrier can be erected. The national security justification, while being challenged, provides the government with a powerful pretext for swift action.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 10% because the judicial process acts as a powerful brake on executive action. The 'plausible' finding by the judge gives significant weight to the status quo, which is non-deportation. For the outcome to be 'Yes,' a series of low-probability events must occur in rapid succession: a quick and unfavorable federal court ruling, the failure to secure an emergency stay from an appellate court, and swift logistical action by ICE. The default pace of the justice system strongly favors the 'No' outcome within this tight timeframe.\n\nI would increase my forecast if the court sets an expedited hearing and denies Khalil's motion for a preliminary injunction before mid-June. I would decrease my forecast if the court grants a preliminary injunction or schedules hearings for late June or July, making deportation before the deadline logistically and legally impossible.",
