    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the strongest near-term negatives: (1) very recent, explicit CEO statements that an IPO is “not imminent” and requires profitability; (2) fresh $450M Series G plus a $200M tender and stated plan for annual secondaries reducing liquidity pressure; (3) a compressed ~40-day window. Forecaster 2 adds the credibility cost of a fast reversal; Forecaster 3 stresses operational lead times for IPO prep. Neither adds contradictory evidence. One nuance they don’t highlight is that a company blog post announcing a confidential submission or intent would satisfy resolution, even without a public S-1—this is the main residual tail. Overall, their arguments are convincing and push slightly lower than my prior 5%.",
    "rationale": "Key factors: extremely short timeline; CEO’s fresh public guidance against an imminent IPO and precondition of profitability; substantial new private capital and structured employee liquidity; and the resolution’s narrow triggers (public S-1 or Rippling blog/news announcement). While the broader IPO market is thawing, there are no credible indicators (bank mandates, senior public-company hires, audit timing tells) suggesting an abrupt move. The remaining path to “Yes” is a surprise public S-1 or a Rippling blog post announcing an intent/confidential submission—possible but unlikely given management’s recent messaging and ample runway. I’m trimming from 5% to 3% to reflect the strong, current statements and short fuse, while keeping a small tail for a strategic pivot or market-driven opportunity.",
