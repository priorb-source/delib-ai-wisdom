    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core constraints I used: multi‑year inadmissibility, need for DHS consent/parole, and short timelines. Forecaster 2 adds useful operational detail (travel documents, CBP coordination) and notes that clandestine reentry wouldn’t be credibly reported in time—an important resolution constraint. Forecaster 3 highlights the credible‑source requirement more explicitly, further reducing the chance that an irregular return would resolve Yes. I find their reasoning sound. I’m less persuaded by Forecaster 2’s 10% given no signals of litigation, DHS review, or congressional pressure; Forecaster 3’s 3% better matches the base rates and the reporting constraint.",
    "rationale": "About two months remain. The baseline after a deportation is a 5–10 year bar, with reentry requiring DHS consent (I‑212) and/or humanitarian parole. Even high‑visibility, expedited cases usually take longer than a few weeks due to legal review, coordination, and travel logistics. We have no signals of active litigation with imminent relief, DHS reconsideration, or congressional intervention. Additionally, the resolution requires credible sources; irregular reentry would likely not be publicly verified in time. These factors keep the near‑term return probability low. I’m updating slightly downward from 4% to 3% to incorporate the explicit public‑reporting constraint and the practical steps (parole approval, travel docs, CBP coordination) that make a return by July 1 even less likely absent clear, near‑term movement.",
