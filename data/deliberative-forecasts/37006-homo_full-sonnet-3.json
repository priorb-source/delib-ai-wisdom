    "review": "All three forecasters converge on a 78-82% probability range, showing strong agreement on the key dynamics. Forecaster 2 and I independently reached 82%, while Forecaster 3 landed at 78%. The core reasoning is remarkably consistent: historical precedent strongly favors the Bloc (32-10 advantage in 2019/2021), current seat projections show a substantial Bloc advantage (19-25 vs 10-12), and Conservative support is geographically concentrated and therefore ceiling-limited. The main analytical difference is emphasis: Forecaster 3 weights the time horizon (6 months) and Bloc vulnerability from their 10-14 point decline more heavily, while Forecaster 2 emphasizes structural advantages and the robustness of current projections. None of us identified factors the others completely missed, which suggests we've captured the relevant considerations. The tight clustering of forecasts (4 percentage point range) indicates we're likely in the correct probability range, though reasonable forecasters could differ on whether current structural advantages (favoring 82%) or future volatility potential (favoring 78%) deserves more weight.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain my 82% forecast. The convergence of all three forecasters in the 78-82% range validates that we're capturing the key factors correctly. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the 6-month timeline and Bloc's 10-14 point decline is reasonable, but these concerns are already embedded in my decision not to forecast 85-90%. The critical structural factors remain: (1) even at the worst-case projection boundaries (Bloc 19, Conservative 12), the Bloc still wins by 7 seats; (2) the Conservative Party's geographic concentration in Quebec City fundamentally limits their province-wide expansion potential; (3) aggregated polling shows a 5-17 point Bloc lead that hasn't been eliminated despite their decline; (4) the Liberal surge is drawing primarily from Bloc voters, maintaining the Bloc-Conservative ordering. The 82% forecast appropriately balances the strong structural case for Yes against legitimate uncertainties about continued Bloc erosion and remaining time for shifts. The minor difference between 78% and 82% reflects reasonable weighting decisions rather than substantive analytical disagreement.",
