  "information": "The Iraqi government has set November 11, 2025, as the date for the parliamentary elections. The Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) announced that the registration period for political alliances would run from April 15 to May 4, 2025. The political landscape is marked by significant divisions within the Shia bloc. The Shiite Coordination Framework, a major coalition, plans to participate in the election with at least six separate lists, though they are in discussions to form a post-election coalition. The electoral law remains a point of contention among political blocs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "59 days until July 1, 2025. Critically, the registration deadline for political alliances is May 4, 2025 - tomorrow.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Muqtada al-Sadr has reaffirmed his election boycott and the Alliance Towards Reforms has not announced participation",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sadr maintains his boycott position through the registration deadline tomorrow (May 4) and continues his strategy of political withdrawal. The Alliance Towards Reforms does not register to field candidates and makes no announcement of participation before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sadr makes a dramatic last-minute reversal and announces participation before tomorrow's registration deadline, OR the IHEC extends the registration deadline and Sadr announces participation before July 1, OR Sadr announces participation after the deadline but before July 1 (though this would likely be procedurally problematic).",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. The question background explicitly states that Sadr has 'reaffirmed election boycott' and 'rejected Iraqi President's plea.' Most critically, the registration deadline for political alliances is May 4, 2025 - literally tomorrow. This creates an extremely narrow window for any announcement of participation.\n\nFor a Yes outcome, one of these scenarios must occur: (1) An immediate reversal announced within 24 hours, (2) An extension of the registration deadline followed by a reversal, or (3) An announcement after the deadline that somehow still allows participation. All of these scenarios require significant deviation from the current trajectory.\n\nWhile Muqtada al-Sadr is known for sudden political maneuvers and has reversed positions before in Iraqi politics, the combination of his recent reaffirmation of the boycott and the imminent registration deadline makes a reversal highly unlikely in this timeframe. The research assistant notes that political alliances needed to register between April 15 and May 4 - we are at the very end of this window with no indication of Sadr's participation.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: (1) The timing is extremely tight with only one day left, (2) Recent public statements reaffirm the boycott, (3) No credible reports suggest an imminent change in position.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: (1) Iraqi politics can be volatile and unpredictable, (2) Sadr has made dramatic reversals before, (3) Registration deadlines could theoretically be extended, (4) Political pressures or deals could emerge suddenly in the next 59 days.\n\nTo update upward, I would need: Clear signals of wavering in Sadr's position, reports of negotiations for participation, or news of registration deadline extension. To update downward: The registration deadline passing tomorrow without announcement, or further reaffirmation of the boycott.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Muqtada al-Sadr's Alliance Towards Reforms party announce that it will participate in the 2025 Iraqi parliamentary election?\n\nQuestion background:\nbasnews: [Sadr Rejects Iraqi President’s Plea, Reaffirms Election Boycott](https://www.basnews.com/en/babat/881132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the Alliance Towards Reforms announces that it will field candidates in Iraq's [2025 parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Iraqi_parliamentary_election).\n\n\"Alliance Towards Reforms\" refers to the \"**تحالف سائرون للإصلا**ح\" or \"سائرون\" coalition, party or movement headed by Muqtada al-Sadr, as decribed at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Towards_Reforms). Name changes will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Iraqi government has set November 11, 2025, as the date for the parliamentary elections.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
