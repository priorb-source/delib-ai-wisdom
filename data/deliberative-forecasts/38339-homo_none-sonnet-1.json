    "review": "All three of us independently arrived at 20%, which is a striking convergence. The other forecasters emphasized several important points I should explicitly acknowledge: Forecaster 2's distinction between expressing need to exit versus actually executing it is crucial - political pressure doesn't automatically translate to action. Forecaster 3's point about parties likely preferring renegotiation over cancellation given geopolitical interdependencies adds valuable context. Both emphasized the complex legal procedures and termination clauses that typically govern such agreements, which reinforces the time constraint issue. None of the forecasters identified new evidence that would suggest imminent action, and all three of us noted the absence of recent developments despite the research assistant's search. This unanimous assessment of the evidence landscape increases my confidence that we're correctly identifying the key factors.",
    "rationale": "The independent convergence at 20% suggests this is approximately the right probability range given available information. The core tension remains: genuine financial and political pressures exist (Bulgargaz bankruptcy threat, high-level political engagement) versus extremely short timeframe (25 days) and strong institutional inertia in international energy agreements. The lenient resolution criteria (announcement by either party, even if disputed) prevents the probability from being lower, perhaps 5-10%. The complete absence of evidence suggesting imminent action and the complexity of international commercial law prevent it from being higher, perhaps 30-40%. If anything, the consensus makes me slightly more confident that 20% appropriately captures the balance between the non-trivial possibility of a crisis-driven announcement and the high likelihood that the status quo persists through the deadline. No new information warrants a significant update.",
