    "review": "Forecaster 2 rightly emphasizes India’s strategic importance and the G7’s pattern of inviting India to outreach sessions, and the potential for a Canada–India reset under a new PM. However, their 65% seems to underweight two constraints: (1) very late stage in the timeline with no public invitation and (2) significant domestic political costs in Canada given the Nijjar case and visible Sikh-Canadian opposition. They also give limited attention to logistics/security lead times. Forecaster 3 adds concrete, time-sensitive evidence: multiple reports of no invitation as of June 3, other outreach invitees already named, and no visible Indian prep. This tightens the logistical and procedural case for No and aligns with the domestic/political headwinds. I find Forecaster 3’s reasoning more convincing given the calendar and process realities, though I retain a small tail for a late diplomatic reversal under G7 pressure.",
    "rationale": "Key updates after deliberation: 1) Reports that several outreach invitees (Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, Brazil) have already been named without India increases the probability that the list is effectively set. 2) The absence of Indian advance preparations this close to the event materially lowers feasibility for in-person attendance, even if a late invite were issued. 3) Canadian domestic political pressure (including organized Sikh groups publicly opposing an invite) raises the host’s cost of extending a late invitation. Balancing factors: India’s consistent presence at recent G7s and the G7’s strategic interest in engaging India keep a non-zero tail; a new Canadian PM could, in theory, use the summit to reset ties, and other G7 members might push for India’s inclusion. Net effect: I lower my forecast from 15% to 12% to reflect the stronger process/timing constraints and indications that the outreach slate is largely finalized, while preserving a small chance of a last-minute political decision and compressed logistics.\nWhat would move me up: Official confirmation of an invitation; credible Indian travel planning signals. What would move me down: Confirmation that the outreach list is closed without India; continued silence for several more days; any fresh Canada–India tension.",
