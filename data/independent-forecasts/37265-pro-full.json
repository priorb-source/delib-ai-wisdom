  "information": "As of May 2, 2025, Tanzania holds a Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution travel advisory from the US State Department, last updated on September 9, 2024. The advisory cites crime, terrorism, and the targeting of LGBTQI+ persons as primary concerns. While the country is at Level 2 overall, specific regions such as Mtwara have a higher, Level 3 warning. In March 2025, the US Embassy issued an alert regarding coastal security.\n\nSeveral other countries in the region or with similar risk profiles have recently been elevated to Level 3. Uganda's advisory was raised due to terrorism risks, political demonstrations, and discriminatory laws. Burundi's Level 3 advisory cites violent crimes like grenade attacks and armed robbery targeting foreigners. The State Department also reissued a Level 3 alert for Bangladesh due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism, and issued a Level 3 warning for Trinidad and Tobago following a surge in violent crime and a declared state of emergency.\n\nThe US State Department's travel advisory system consists of four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). Advisories are regularly reviewed and can be upgraded due to factors like a significant deterioration in security, increased terrorist activity, political instability, or civil unrest. A notable security concern for Tanzania is the insurgency in Mozambique's Niassa Reserve, which borders the country. Terrorist activity linked to Islamic extremism was reported in the area as recently as April 2025, creating potential spillover risks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The travel advisory for Tanzania remains at Level 2, as the current security situation does not deteriorate significantly enough to warrant an upgrade.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security situation in Tanzania remains stable. The threats from crime and terrorism, particularly the spillover from Mozambique, remain contained in specific regions and do not escalate or spread to major cities or primary tourist destinations. No significant incidents involving US citizens occur, and the US State Department sees no compelling reason to alter its existing assessment within the short timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant event occurs, such as a terrorist attack in a major city like Dar es Salaam or a popular tourist area like Zanzibar. Alternatively, there is a notable escalation of the insurgency spilling over from Mozambique into southern Tanzania, or a sharp, sustained increase in violent crime targeting foreigners. This event prompts a rapid reassessment by the US State Department, leading to an upgrade of the country-wide advisory to Level 3.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong tendency for the status quo to persist over short timeframes, balanced against tangible and recent security threats. Tanzania's current advisory is Level 2, last updated in September 2024. Changing this requires a significant deterioration in the security environment. The primary argument for the 'No' outcome is the short, two-month window until the resolution date; bureaucratic and assessment processes are often slow to react without a major catalyzing event. Furthermore, the State Department already manages localized risk by assigning a higher Level 3 advisory to the Mtwara region, suggesting it can signal specific dangers without elevating the entire country's status. However, the probability is not lower because of credible threats. The research indicates an active insurgency on the Mozambique border, with terrorist activity reported as recently as April 2025, and a US Embassy coastal security alert was issued in March 2025. Additionally, the elevation of nearby countries like Uganda and Burundi to Level 3 for similar reasons (terrorism, crime) sets a regional precedent. These factors create a non-trivial risk of a security incident that could trigger a rapid upgrade. I would raise my probability following a high-profile terrorist incident or a significant increase in violent crime targeting Westerners. I would lower it if the period passes without any major security alerts or incidents.",
