    "review": "Both peers largely mirror my view: short runway, high political symbolism, and strong inertia keep the base case as No. The most useful addition is Forecaster 3’s explicit point that waivers/general licenses would not remove Nord Stream 2 AG from the SDN List; the resolution requires a formal delisting. That narrows the viable paths to “Yes” and makes quick action less likely. Forecaster 2 adds the prospect of congressional pushback and coordinated allied signaling as hurdles—again consistent with my thinking. I see Forecaster 2’s 22% as slightly high given the formal-delisting requirement and the low practical payoff of delisting NS2 AG versus other forms of energy sanctions relief that don’t touch the SDN status. Overall, their arguments reinforce rather than materially shift my view.",
    "rationale": "- Time remaining: ~8 weeks to July 1 is tight for an interagency decision with significant symbolic cost. OFAC can execute quickly once directed, but the political decision is the bottleneck.\n- Status quo stickiness: High-profile Russia SDN delistings are rare absent clear strategic shifts or ownership/control changes. NS2 AG has been SDN-listed since 2022; the pipeline is damaged/idle, so the policy benefit of delisting is limited.\n- Formal delisting requirement: Licenses, waivers, or eased enforcement do not satisfy the resolution. A formal delisting is needed, which raises the political bar and reduces flexibility versus other energy measures the White House could pursue.\n- Politics and optics: Delisting would be seen as a symbolic concession to a Gazprom-controlled entity amid ongoing war, inviting domestic and allied criticism and potential congressional countermeasures. That makes it an unlikely early move even if broader Russia energy policy changes are under discussion (per the April 23 Politico report).\n- Why not higher: Short timeline, low benefit/high symbolism, and the formal-delisting hurdle all argue against near-term action on NS2 AG specifically.\n- Why not lower: Credible reporting indicates the option is under active consideration, and if the administration chooses a rapid reset signal, OFAC could implement quickly. Bundling within a broader policy package remains a tail scenario.\nNet: Peers’ points mostly reinforce my prior. The added clarity about licenses vs delisting slightly strengthens the No case, but I was already low. I’ll hold essentially steady.",
