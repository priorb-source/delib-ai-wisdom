    "review": "All three forecasters are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of this question. The consensus is that the status quo ('No') is the most likely outcome, primarily due to the very short five-week timeline until resolution. We all identified the severe outbreak in South America, particularly Colombia, as the main source of risk for a 'Yes' outcome. The key mitigating factors we all noted are the proactive public health measures in the most at-risk North American countries, especially Panama. Forecaster 2 raised an excellent and highly persuasive point I had not explicitly weighed: Panama has not recorded a human case of yellow fever since 1974. This 50-year track record is powerful evidence of a robust and effective, long-term public health system for this specific disease. Forecaster 3's framing of the necessary 'causal chain' (introduction, infection, detection, reporting, advisory) was also a very clear way to articulate why the short timeline presents such a high barrier for a 'Yes' outcome. Both of these arguments strengthen the case for 'No'.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast slightly from 8% to 6%. Their reasoning has convinced me that my initial assessment, while directionally correct, may have overweighted the risk from the 'viral pressure' of the Colombian outbreak and underweighted the proven resilience of Panama's public health infrastructure. The fact that Panama has successfully prevented yellow fever transmission for 50 years, as highlighted by Forecaster 2, is a critical piece of evidence. This long-term success suggests that their control measures are not just a recent reaction but a deeply embedded and effective system capable of withstanding pressure from regional outbreaks. This significantly lowers the probability of the virus successfully crossing the border, establishing local transmission, and being detected within the next five weeks. While I still believe the severity of the current regional outbreak creates a tangible tail risk, the additional evidence persuades me that the probability of a 'Yes' outcome is lower than I first estimated. This modest downward adjustment to 6% reflects my increased confidence in the existing public health barriers.",
