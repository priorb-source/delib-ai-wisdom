  "information": "The relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has recently shown signs of strain. After investing heavily in Trump's 2024 campaign, Musk was appointed co-director of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). However, disagreements arose over Musk's proposals for drastic government spending cuts and his support for policies like H-1B visas, which conflicted with Trump's agenda. In May 2025, Musk announced he would reduce his political involvement and spending to focus on his businesses, leading to a mutually agreed-upon withdrawal from his role in DOGE. Correspondingly, analyses show that Trump has not mentioned Musk on his Truth Social account in over a month, a significant decrease from his previous frequency.\n\nThe Trump administration's current immigration policy focus is on a new 'Gold Card' visa plan designed to attract foreign investors with at least $5 million in funds. The plan, which is not yet passed by Congress, would grant permanent residence and work rights. Elon Musk confirmed on the social media platform X that the government is conducting a 'silent test' of the application website. The proposal has sparked debate on whether it will replace or supplement the existing EB-5 investment visa program. Separately, the administration opened the registration period for the H-1B visa program, which both Trump and Musk have supported, for the 2026 fiscal year in March 2025.\n\nRecent activity shows a shift in the priorities and communication styles of both Elon Musk and Donald Trump. An analysis of Musk's posts on X revealed that his content has shifted away from U.S. government and politics, with only 19% of his posts in May being on these topics compared to 51% in February. He is now posting more about his business ventures, including space travel, electric vehicles, and AI. Meanwhile, Donald Trump primarily uses Truth Social for his communications, with reports noting that posts from his account on X are rare.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About six weeks. The forecast date is May 22, 2025, and the resolution will be checked on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The base rate for either individual tweeting this exact phrase is extremely low. Donald Trump primarily uses Truth Social, not X/Twitter, and the research indicates both he and Elon Musk are focused on other immigration topics (like the 'Gold Card' and H-1B visas) rather than the Diversity Visa.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The period between the start of the year and the April 1, 2025 deadline passes without any specific, high-profile news event related to the Diversity Visa program. Consequently, the topic does not become salient enough to warrant a comment from either Trump or Musk, who remain focused on their stated priorities. Trump contains his political commentary to Truth Social, and Musk's posts on X continue to pivot towards his business ventures.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant news story related to the Diversity Visa program breaks before April 1, 2025 — for example, a court ruling, a legislative proposal to end the program, or a high-profile crime involving a recipient. This prompts a reaction from Donald Trump, who uses his X account to reach a broader audience with a post condemning the program and calling for its termination, using the exact phrase 'diversity visa'.",
    "rationale": "The probability of a 'Yes' outcome is low, estimated at 5%. The deadline for the event has already passed (April 1, 2025), so we are forecasting whether the event occurred in the recent past. The provided intelligence, dated May 22, 2025, strongly supports a 'No' resolution. \n\nFirstly, there are significant platform and focus barriers. Donald Trump's primary communication channel is Truth Social, with posts on X being rare, which mechanically lowers the probability of a qualifying tweet. Secondly, the administration's immigration focus appears to be on a new 'Gold Card' for investors and the H-1B program, with no mention of the Diversity Visa. Similarly, Elon Musk's engagement with U.S. politics on X has reportedly decreased, shifting towards his business interests, and his stated immigration priorities align with high-skilled workers, not a lottery system. Finally, the resolution criteria are strict, requiring the exact phrase 'diversity visa,' which is a higher bar than a general comment on the 'visa lottery.'\n\nThe forecast is not lower than 5% because both individuals are famously unpredictable and prolific on social media. Immigration is a cornerstone of Trump's political identity, and he has previously criticized this specific program. A triggering news event between January and March 2025, which is not captured in the May report, could plausibly have elicited a qualifying post from either him or Musk.\n\nThe forecast is not higher because the combined weight of the evidence points strongly toward 'No.' The status quo is that this is not a top-of-mind issue for either individual, and they are not using the specified platform in a way that makes a qualifying post likely. The provided report suggests their attention in early 2025 was directed elsewhere.\n\nI would increase my probability if new information emerged showing a significant legislative push or media controversy regarding the Diversity Visa program occurred in the first quarter of 2025. Conversely, I would decrease it if a review of their social media activity from that period confirmed their focus was exclusively on other topics.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**. If not, it resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has recently shown signs of strain.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
