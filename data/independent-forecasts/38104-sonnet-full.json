  "information": "The escape from the Orleans Justice Center on May 16, 2025, involved ten inmates and went undetected for seven hours. The inmates created a hole in a wall behind a toilet, climbed out through a maintenance area, and used a mattress to get over a barbed-wire fence. An investigation revealed significant security flaws, including chronic understaffing, with the prison at only 60% of required staffing at the time. A federal monitor's report had previously warned of a deteriorated security situation, citing inmates' ability to manipulate cell locks. At least three jail employees have been arrested in connection with the escape, which the Orleans Parish Sheriff believes was an 'inside job' aided by staff.\n\nA multi-agency manhunt is underway, involving over 200 officers from local, state, and federal bodies, including the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The reward for information leading to the capture of the two remaining fugitives has been increased to $50,000 per person, with funds contributed by Crimestoppers, the FBI, and the ATF. As of late May 2025, law enforcement had received nearly 700 tips from the public. In connection with the escape and subsequent aid to the fugitives, at least 14 accomplices have been arrested, including family members of one of the escapees.\n\nAs of May 30, 2025, eight of the ten escapees have been recaptured. Some captures occurred out of state, including two inmates who were apprehended in Walker County, Texas, after a high-speed chase. The two fugitives still at large are Antoine Massey, 33, and Derrick Groves, 27, who are both considered armed and dangerous. Groves is a convicted murderer awaiting sentencing for a double homicide. Massey is described as a 'serial escapee' with three prior escapes from custody and was also being sought for kidnapping and rape. A former federal warden noted that Massey's housing in a first-floor cell was a significant security risk.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - two fugitives remain at large",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the two remaining escapees, particularly Antoine Massey given his history as a 'serial escapee' with three prior successful escapes, evades capture by utilizing established support networks, leaving the state or country, or hiding in areas difficult for law enforcement to penetrate until July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The intensive multi-agency manhunt involving 200+ officers, $100,000 in total rewards, and nearly 700 tips leads to the capture of both remaining fugitives within the next 32 days. The arrest of 14 accomplices has disrupted their support networks, forcing them into situations where they can be apprehended.",
    "rationale": "Eight of ten escapees were recaptured within 14 days of the May 16 escape, demonstrating initial law enforcement effectiveness. However, the two remaining fugitives present a more challenging case. Antoine Massey is particularly concerning as a 'serial escapee' with three prior successful escapes from custody - his track record suggests specific skills or networks that enable evasion. Derrick Groves, a convicted murderer, also poses significant challenges. The substantial resources deployed (FBI, US Marshals, ATF, 200+ officers, and $50,000 rewards per fugitive) create strong capture pressure. The arrest of 14 accomplices likely degrades the fugitives' support infrastructure. However, 14 days have already elapsed without their capture, suggesting they may have gone to ground effectively or left the area. The 32 remaining days provide substantial time for capture, approximately double the period already elapsed. Historical patterns show most prison escapees are eventually caught, but Massey's proven ability to evade capture three times previously is a significant counter-indicator. The probability isn't higher because Massey's track record specifically demonstrates evasion capability, and 14 days without capture suggests these are the most resourceful of the ten. The probability isn't lower because the unprecedented scale of law enforcement response, high rewards, large tip volume, and time remaining (32 days) create strong conditions for eventual capture.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
