    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Ralph Norman remains a U.S. Representative and does not declare his candidacy for the U.S. Senate race in South Carolina, leading to a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ralph Norman continues to weigh his options but ultimately concludes that a primary challenge against a well-funded, long-term incumbent like Lindsey Graham is too difficult. He chooses to focus on his role in the House of Representatives, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Convinced that there is a strong appetite among conservative South Carolina voters for an alternative to Lindsey Graham, Ralph Norman secures the necessary financial backing and political support to launch a credible campaign. He makes a formal announcement of his candidacy before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the lack of public preparatory actions and the short timeframe remaining. The deadline is just one month away. Typically, a serious Senate campaign requires months of groundwork, including forming an exploratory committee, fundraising, hiring key staff, and building a campaign infrastructure. There is currently no public evidence that Rep. Norman has taken these steps. The Axios article mentioning his consideration of a run is from September 2023; the lack of follow-up reporting suggests the initiative may have lost momentum. The status quo, where a potential challenger ultimately decides against taking on a powerful incumbent, is the most common outcome in politics. Therefore, the base rate strongly favors a 'No' resolution. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 10% because Ralph Norman is ideologically positioned as a strong primary challenger from the right, and the possibility of a surprise, well-organized campaign launch cannot be entirely dismissed. He remains one of the most logical potential challengers to Graham. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the absence of any tangible signs of a campaign so close to the deadline is a very strong negative indicator. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see credible reports of fundraising activity, key staff hires, or FEC filings related to a potential Senate run by Norman.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ralph Norman declare his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Sen. Lindsey Graham may face right-wing primary challenge in 2026](https://www.axios.com/2023/09/13/lindsey-graham-primary-challenge-ralph-norman)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Will Ralph Norman declares his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
