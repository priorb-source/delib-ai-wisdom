    "review": "Both forecasters align with my prior view: small, tightly regulated market; explicit enforcement posture against unlicensed operators; existing local ride-hail options; and no pre-launch signals from Uber. The additional emphasis on the lack of typical pre-launch indicators (regulatory MOUs, partner/leak reporting, job postings, help-center stubs) is a useful diagnostic I hadn’t explicitly highlighted. Their framing of a mid-June signal deadline for any plausible July 1 launch is also sensible. No new contradictory evidence was presented.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is short (~60 days). TCI authorities recently underscored strict licensing and fined facilitation of illegal taxis, which is inconsistent with a quick, gray-area rollout. Local apps (GetMe Ride, Conch Cab) already provide a regulated, politically acceptable channel, reducing the urgency to invite a global entrant. Uber’s recent expansion cadence focuses on larger markets or well-structured taxi integrations, typically preceded by detectable signals. None are visible here. A narrow path to Yes exists if the government and licensed taxi associations invite an “Uber Taxi” integration and Uber can rapidly onboard fleets, but we’d likely see at least one of: partnership chatter, regulatory statements, or website/app artifacts in advance. Given the corroborating analyses and the added point about signal absence, I’m nudging down slightly from 7% to 6%. I would move up on any credible report of a government–Uber/taxi association MOU or clear pre-launch artifacts; I would move down further if authorities explicitly back only local platforms or if no signals emerge by mid-June.",
