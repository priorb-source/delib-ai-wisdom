  "information": "According to the US Census Bureau, U.S. imports reached a record high of $342.7 billion in March 2025, a 5% increase from February. This surge was attributed to businesses front-running impending tariffs. The import of consumer goods rose 55.5% year-over-year to $102.8 billion, and automotive vehicle imports also jumped. This activity led to the U.S. trade deficit for goods increasing by 9.6% to a record $162 billion in March. A similar, though smaller, surge was observed in January 2025, when imports reached $320 billion, with notable increases in shipments from China, Canada, and Mexico.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The US Census Bureau is expected to release the U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services report, which includes April 2025 data, in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The record-high imports reported for March 2025 were attributed to a temporary surge from businesses front-running impending tariffs. This pull-forward of demand would logically lead to a contraction in import activity in April, causing the total value to fall below the $338.5 billion threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The front-loading of imports in March 2025 proves to be substantial. As a result, businesses have high inventory levels and drastically reduce their import orders for April. This creates a significant drop from the March peak, with the total import value for April falling well below the $338.5 billion threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Underlying U.S. economic demand is exceptionally strong, requiring continued high levels of imports that largely offset the March front-loading effect. Alternatively, the front-loading continues into April as businesses rush to beat tariff deadlines. This sustained momentum keeps the total import value above the $338.5 billion threshold for a second consecutive month.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the classic economic pattern of front-running ahead of tariffs. The research data indicates that March 2025 imports hit a record $342.7 billion, explicitly due to this effect. Such a surge pulls demand forward from subsequent months, making a downturn in April the most likely scenario. The threshold for a 'Yes' outcome is $338.483 billion, only 1.2% below the all-time record set in March. A reversion to a more normal import level after such a surge would almost certainly result in a 'No' outcome. For context, January 2025 imports were $320 billion. The probability is not lower than 25% because underlying U.S. economic demand may still be robust, and the general environment is one of high import values, which provides some upward pressure. The probability is not higher because ignoring the pull-forward effect would be a significant oversight; a second consecutive month at or near an all-time record is highly improbable under these circumstances. I would become more confident in a 'Yes' outcome if I saw evidence of accelerating consumer demand in April or the announcement of new, imminent tariff deadlines. I would become more confident in 'No' if preliminary shipping and port data for April showed a sharp decline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US imports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of imports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 338,483 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, U.S. imports reached a record high of $342.7 billion in March 2025, a 5% increase from February. This surge was attributed to businesses front-running impending tariffs. The import of consumer goods rose 55.5% year-over-year to $102.8 billion, and automotive vehicle imports also jumped.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
