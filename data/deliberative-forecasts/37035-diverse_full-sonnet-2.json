    "review": "All three forecasters converged remarkably on 4-6%, which suggests robust consensus on the core dynamics. The key arguments we all emphasize are: (1) CDC's strong historical precedent of never raising yellow fever above Level 2, even during Brazil's 2017-18 outbreak with >2,000 cases vs Colombia's 79, (2) yellow fever is vaccine-preventable and Level 2 already addresses this, (3) Level 3 requires sustained urban transmission or unmitigatable risks, (4) current outbreak is rural with no verified urban transmission, and (5) very short timeframe of ~38 days makes rapid escalation unlikely.\n\nForecaster 3 raises an interesting point about the high case fatality rate possibly reflecting under-detection, suggesting true cases might be higher. However, even if true cases are 3-4x reported levels (200-300), this remains far below historical outbreaks that stayed at Level 2. More importantly, Forecaster 3 notes that CDC just issued the Level 2 regional alert in April 2025, meaning they made a deliberate, recent decision to set it at Level 2. Moving to Level 3 within 5-6 weeks would require either a dramatic misjudgment or a rapid, significant change.\n\nBoth forecasters identified similar triggers for upward revision: sustained urban transmission in major cities, traveler infections, healthcare collapse, or vaccine access problems. No forecaster presented evidence that any of these triggers are currently manifesting or likely within our timeframe.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find strong agreement on the fundamental dynamics. The convergence on 4-6% across three independent forecasters suggests this range accurately captures the situation. My original reasoning stands: the CDC's historical precedent is overwhelming, the outbreak is small-scale and rural, effective mitigation (vaccination) exists, and the timeframe is extremely compressed.\n\nThe most compelling new consideration is the timing of CDC's recent Level 2 designation in April 2025. This recent, deliberate policy decision makes a near-term reversal even less likely than I initially assessed. The CDC is actively monitoring Colombia and chose Level 2 with current information. For them to escalate to Level 3 within 38 days would require either a dramatic new development (sustained urban transmission, which we haven't seen) or acknowledgment of a significant misjudgment (unlikely given their experience and the overwhelming precedent).\n\nThe under-detection argument is valid but doesn't materially change the forecast. Even with significant under-reporting, the observable outbreak scale remains orders of magnitude smaller than historical cases that stayed at Level 2.\n\nI'm adjusting slightly upward from 4% to 5% primarily to align with the well-reasoned consensus range, acknowledging that the national emergency declaration and ongoing outbreak progression warrant not going lower. However, I remain confident the probability is in the low single digits given the extraordinary weight of historical precedent, the absence of urban transmission triggers, and the compressed timeline.",
