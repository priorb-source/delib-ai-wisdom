    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling points that strengthen the case for a low probability. Forecaster 2 provides valuable historical context - past Greenlandic referendums (1979, 2008) had substantial lead times, which is directly relevant precedent. The quantification of economic dependence (4.3bn DKK annual grant, ~50% of budget) and the note that the constitution-drafting process has been contentious and delayed both reinforce the gradualist timeline. Forecaster 3's polling data (80%+ support for independence, but ~half would reconsider with lower living standards) effectively illustrates why conditional support doesn't translate to urgency. The procedural barriers emphasized by Forecaster 2 - coalition forming, legislative process, enabling acts - are particularly important given we're talking about a brand new government with only 2 months remaining. However, I think Forecaster 3's point about volatility and symbolic gestures has some merit, which is why 15% isn't unreasonable, though I find the procedural and historical arguments more persuasive.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast slightly downward to 10%. The historical precedent of long lead times for past Greenlandic referendums is a strong data point I had underweighted. The procedural complexity of a new government needing to form coalitions, establish priorities, and navigate legislative processes in just ~8 weeks makes even a simple announcement quite difficult. The quantified economic dependence (50% of budget from Denmark) reinforces why this gradualist government won't feel pressure to rush. That said, I'm not going as low as 8% because: (1) the question's bar is very low - merely announcing a future date, which could be years away, (2) the volatile political environment with Trump's attention could create unexpected pressure for symbolic action, and (3) Greenlandic politics are broadly pro-independence, creating some baseline risk of political maneuvering. The 8-15% range all three of us occupy suggests reasonable consensus that this is unlikely but not impossible. 10% appropriately weights the strong procedural and historical arguments while maintaining some probability for unexpected political developments.",
