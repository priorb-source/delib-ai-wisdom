  "information": "Recent economic data and market indicators reflect a mixed economic picture. The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a deceleration in its annual rate. However, the April jobs report indicated a higher-than-expected increase in non-agricultural employment, with the unemployment rate holding at 4.2%. In response to economic developments and Fed communications, market expectations have shifted. Indicators like the CME FedWatch tool show that the perceived likelihood of a rate cut in June has decreased, with many market participants now viewing September or later as the most probable period for the start of an easing cycle.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025. There is likely one scheduled FOMC meeting in mid-June 2025 before the resolution deadline.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No rate cut. The Federal Reserve has paused its rate-cutting cycle and maintains current interest rate levels through the June FOMC meeting.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Fed maintains its current stance at the June FOMC meeting, citing strong employment data (4.2% unemployment, higher-than-expected job gains) and the need for more time to assess inflation trends despite CPI deceleration. The committee decides to wait until at least September before resuming any easing cycle, wanting to ensure inflation is durably returning to the 2% target.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Unexpected economic deterioration occurs in late May or early June - either a sharp uptick in unemployment, a significant financial market stress event, or a dramatic weakening in growth indicators. This prompts the Fed to cut rates at the June FOMC meeting to provide support, or in an extreme scenario, an emergency inter-meeting rate cut.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly suggests no rate cut before July 1. First, market expectations via CME FedWatch have shifted away from June cuts, with participants now viewing September or later as the most probable timing. Second, the Fed has already paused its cutting cycle, indicating a wait-and-see approach. Third, recent economic data shows resilience - the April jobs report exceeded expectations and unemployment remains at 4.2%, which doesn't signal urgent need for accommodation. While CPI has decelerated, this alone isn't sufficient given the Fed's focus on achieving sustainable inflation control. The timeframe is critical: there's only about 6.5 weeks left and likely just one FOMC meeting (mid-June). The Fed tends to move deliberately, especially after recently pausing. Emergency inter-meeting cuts are extremely rare outside major crises. My forecast isn't higher because the economic fundamentals don't support urgency for cuts, and market pricing clearly reflects low probability. It's not lower because there's non-trivial uncertainty - unexpected economic shocks can occur, and the Fed could surprise markets if data deteriorates sharply. To move higher, I'd need to see: weakening employment data, financial market stress, or explicit Fed communications suggesting June action. To move lower, I'd need stronger economic data or Fed officials explicitly ruling out near-term cuts.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement. Therefore, the effective date of the rate cut does not need to be before the resolution date, as long as the announcement is made before then.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nRecent economic data and market indicators reflect a mixed economic picture.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
