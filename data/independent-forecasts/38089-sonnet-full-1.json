  "information": "According to a visual analysis of a Morning Consult snapshot from May 8, 2025, Pedro Sánchez's approval rating was 35%, while Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's was 32%. A separate survey from January 21-27, 2025 by the same source, reported by El Economista, listed both leaders as having high disapproval rates. Regarding economic indicators, reports noted that Turkey's consumer confidence gained 5% in April, contrasted with a slump in Europe, and that Spain was experiencing an economic recovery.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has taken a vocal stance on the conflict in Gaza, describing the situation as a 'genocide' and vowing to raise Spain's voice to end the 'massacre.' In May 2024, his government officially recognized the State of Palestine, and Spain is expected to impose sanctions on Israel. Sánchez is also pushing for stronger EU action, including a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Domestically, his activities include efforts for Catalan language recognition and social policies such as early retirement reforms.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has initiated work on a new constitution, appointing a team of legal experts to draft it. Erdoğan stated the current constitution is outdated, while critics raised concerns the move could be intended to extend his presidency beyond 2028, a claim he has denied. Erdoğan also ruled out early elections. In foreign affairs, he publicly criticized Pedro Sánchez for showing support for the detained Istanbul Mayor, Ekrem İmamoğlu. The two leaders met in Istanbul in May 2025 to discuss bilateral relations, including trade, security, and the situation in Gaza.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33 days until July 1, 2025 when the outcome will be determined",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - based on the most recent data from May 8, 2025, Sánchez leads with 35% approval versus Erdoğan's 32%, a 3-point advantage",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Erdoğan's approval rating rises or Sánchez's falls sufficiently in the next month such that Erdoğan equals or surpasses Sánchez. This could occur if Turkey's improving economic indicators translate into political support, if Erdoğan's constitutional reform initiative is well-received, or if Sánchez faces a domestic scandal or policy backlash regarding his Gaza stance or other controversial positions",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sánchez maintains or extends his current 3-point lead over the next month. This is most likely through simple status quo persistence, but could be reinforced by Spain's continued economic recovery, positive reception of his foreign policy positions, or negative reactions in Turkey to Erdoğan's constitution efforts that critics see as a power grab to extend his presidency",
    "rationale": "The most critical factor is the status quo: Morning Consult data from May 8, 2025 shows Sánchez at 35% and Erdoğan at 32%, giving Sánchez a 3-point lead. With only one month until the resolution date, this recent snapshot carries substantial weight. Good forecasting practice emphasizes that the world changes slowly, and approval ratings particularly tend to show persistence over short timeframes barring major shocks. While a 3-point margin is not insurmountable, reversing it in 33 days would require notable developments. Both leaders face challenging political environments with high disapproval rates, which creates some volatility risk. Turkey's improving consumer confidence and Spain's economic recovery provide mixed signals about potential momentum. Erdoğan's controversial constitutional reform and Sánchez's vocal Gaza positions are wildcards that could shift sentiment either direction. However, the combination of Sánchez's current lead, the short time horizon, and the general stability of approval ratings over monthly periods strongly favors the status quo outcome. This forecast is not higher because the 3-point gap could be within polling variations, both leaders are polarizing figures in volatile political contexts, and unexpected events could shift public opinion quickly. It is not lower because one month is insufficient time for dramatic shifts absent major crises, the current lead is clear and recent, and there is no evidence of pending events likely to reverse the standings",
