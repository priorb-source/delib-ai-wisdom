  "information": "On May 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the decision was due to Harvard's repeated failure to comply with federal law and reporting requirements. The administration accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. Other justifications cited by DHS included creating an 'unsafe environment' hostile to Jewish students, failing to address incidents of campus harassment, and not providing requested government information regarding the conduct of foreign students.\n\nThe SEVP certification revocation would prohibit Harvard from enrolling new international students holding F or J visas for the 2025-2026 academic year. The decision affects approximately 6,800 current international students, who constitute about 27% of Harvard's student body. These students would be required to transfer to other SEVP-certified institutions or risk losing their legal status in the United States. Following the announcement, the University of Tokyo stated it is considering accepting affected Harvard students, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry pledged to protect the rights of its overseas students.\n\nIn response to the DHS action, Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the administration. On May 23, 2025, a federal judge granted Harvard a temporary restraining order (TRO), which has halted the enforcement of the SEVP certification revocation. As a result of the TRO, Harvard's certification is currently considered active. The university's lawsuit alleges that the administration's actions are unconstitutional retaliation that violates the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. A court hearing to determine whether a preliminary injunction will be issued is scheduled for May 29.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 34 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Harvard’s SEVP certification remains active under court order (TRO now; likely preliminary injunction) allowing international student enrollment.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The court denies a preliminary injunction, the TRO expires in early June, DHS’s revocation takes effect, and Harvard fails to obtain an emergency stay on appeal before July 1. Alternatively, an appellate court or the Supreme Court grants the government a stay that reinstates the revocation before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The judge grants a preliminary injunction that maintains or restores Harvard’s SEVP certification (including the ability to enroll international students) through at least July 1; or DHS rescinds/suspends its revocation; or higher courts decline to stay the injunction before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Key facts from the research assistant: DHS revoked Harvard’s SEVP certification on May 22. A federal judge issued a TRO on May 23 that currently keeps Harvard’s certification active. A preliminary-injunction hearing is set for May 29. The lawsuit alleges constitutional and APA violations; DHS cites campus climate and reporting failures.\n\nReasoning: Courts often preserve the status quo via TROs/PIs when agency actions cause immediate, large-scale, and arguably irreparable harm (thousands of international students, imminent deadlines). The TRO already signals the judge saw serious questions and irreparable harm. If a preliminary injunction is granted, it will likely extend past July 1. Appealing and obtaining a stay before July 1 is possible but not guaranteed, and the likely appellate venues (First Circuit or D.C. Circuit) are not especially inclined to grant quick stays for thinly supported agency actions, particularly where First Amendment/APA issues are plausible.\n\nWhy not higher: There are meaningful downside risks. The judge could deny a preliminary injunction or narrow it (e.g., protecting only current students). The government could secure an appellate stay before July 1. Immigration/SEVP contexts can receive deference, and if DHS’s administrative record shows concrete noncompliance with SEVIS reporting, courts might be more receptive to DHS.\n\nWhy not lower: The TRO is a positive signal. Harvard’s harm case is strong. Courts frequently maintain existing conditions pending full review, especially with complex constitutional/APA claims and major public impacts. The short timeline to July 1 also favors continuity unless the government swiftly wins a stay.\n\nWhat would move me up: Clear indications at/after the May 29 hearing that the judge will grant a broad preliminary injunction; orders explicitly preserving Harvard’s ability to enroll new F/J students; signs DHS is walking back or reissuing the action more narrowly; amicus and institutional support emphasizing legal weaknesses in DHS’s rationale.\n\nWhat would move me down: Denial of the preliminary injunction; expiration of the TRO without extension; signals the court will limit relief to current students only (thus not truly allowing enrollment); a prompt appellate stay of any injunction; credible reporting that DHS’s administrative record is strong on statutory/regulatory noncompliance.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
