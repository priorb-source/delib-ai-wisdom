    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Given the recent plunge in consumer sentiment reported in May, the status quo is for consumer pessimism to persist. Without a significant positive economic shock, the index is likely to remain below the 60.0 threshold, continuing the established downward trend.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Key economic data released in June, particularly the May Consumer Price Index, shows inflation remains stubbornly high. This leads the Federal Reserve to maintain a hawkish stance in its mid-month meeting, dashing hopes for near-term rate cuts. Consumers' views on their personal finances and the economic outlook remain sour, keeping the final sentiment index at or below 60.0.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The May inflation report, released in mid-June, comes in surprisingly low, sparking a stock market rally and shifting expectations towards a more dovish Federal Reserve. This is coupled with a steady decline in retail gasoline prices throughout the month. The combination of these positive developments boosts consumers' short-term economic outlook, lifting the final index just above the 60.0 mark.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the recent 'plunge' in consumer sentiment, as noted in the provided background information. Such sharp drops typically exhibit momentum, as the underlying causes (e.g., inflation concerns, interest rate uncertainty, tariff talks) are not quick to resolve. Therefore, the status quo points strongly towards a 'No' outcome, with sentiment remaining in pessimistic territory. The probability of a 'Yes' is set at 35%, acknowledging that the 60.0 threshold is not insurmountably high from a potential bottom. A reading above 60.0 would likely require a significant positive catalyst. The primary candidates for such a catalyst are the major economic data releases scheduled before the final survey period, namely the May jobs report and, more importantly, the May inflation (CPI) report. A surprisingly positive CPI print could significantly alter consumer expectations about inflation and Fed policy, causing a rebound in sentiment. My forecast is not lower than 35% because sentiment indices can be volatile, and a partial 'bounce' from an oversold low is a plausible scenario, especially if key prices like gasoline fall. My forecast is not higher because this would under-weight the strong signal of the recent plunge and the persistence of macroeconomic headwinds. I would update my forecast higher (towards Yes) on news of a significant and unexpected drop in inflation or a clear dovish signal from the Federal Reserve. I would update lower (towards No) if inflation data comes in hot or the labor market shows unexpected weakness.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be greater than 60.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is greater than 60.0 for June 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
