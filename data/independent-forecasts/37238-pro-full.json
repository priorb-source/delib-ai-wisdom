  "information": "Donald Trump has a history of attending high-profile sporting events. His recent UFC appearances include UFC 309 in November 2024 and UFC 314 on April 13, 2025. His attendance at UFC 314 was noted on his official public schedule. The time between UFC 314 in Miami and UFC 316 in Newark is less than two months. Some analyses of his past behavior suggest he rarely attends two UFC events in such close succession.\n\nUFC 316 is scheduled for June 7, 2025, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. The event's main fight is a bantamweight title rematch between Sean O'Malley and Merab Dvalishvili. Donald Trump and UFC President Dana White have a long-standing public friendship. In the past, Trump hosted early UFC events at his properties, including the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. White has publicly supported Trump, including an appearance at the 2024 National Republican Convention.\n\nAt UFC 314 in Miami on April 13, 2025, Donald Trump was seen with Dana White and Elon Musk. Reports also mentioned the presence of political figures such as Kash Patel, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Kristi Noem, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio. Trump was greeted by Shaquille O'Neal and Joe Rogan, and he entered the arena to the song 'American Bad Ass' by Kid Rock, receiving a positive reaction from the crowd.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month and 1 week, as the event is scheduled for June 7, 2025, and today is April 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The default assumption for any individual, including a former president, is that they will not be at a specific entertainment event unless there is a particular reason for them to attend. Non-attendance is the baseline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Donald Trump has a scheduling conflict with a political rally, fundraising event, or another high-priority engagement. Alternatively, having attended UFC 314 less than two months prior, he decides to skip this event to avoid overexposure or simply because his schedule does not permit it.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Leveraging his strong relationship with UFC President Dana White and the event's convenient location in Newark, New Jersey, close to his residences, Donald Trump decides to attend. The appearance serves as a valuable public relations opportunity to connect with a supportive demographic, and his attendance is confirmed on his public schedule shortly before the event.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 65% indicates that Donald Trump's attendance is more likely than not. The primary drivers for this forecast are the confluence of a strong personal relationship, geographical convenience, and a receptive audience.\n\nKey factors supporting a 'Yes' outcome:\n1.  **Relationship with Dana White:** Trump and Dana White have a well-documented, long-standing friendship and business history. White is a vocal supporter, and this personal connection makes Trump's attendance at UFC events more probable than at other sporting events.\n2.  **Geographical Proximity:** UFC 316 is in Newark, New Jersey, a short distance from Trump's primary residences in Bedminster, NJ, and New York City. This dramatically lowers the logistical barrier for attendance compared to events in other parts of the country.\n3.  **Supportive Environment:** UFC events have consistently provided a positive and energetic reception for Trump, functioning as informal political rallies that reinforce his popular appeal with a key demographic. His appearance at UFC 314 was met with a very positive crowd reaction.\n\nFactors weighing against a 'Yes' outcome:\n1.  **Recency of Last Appearance:** Trump attended UFC 314 on April 13, 2025. As noted by the research assistant, attending another major event less than two months later would be a departure from some analyses of his past patterns. This is the strongest argument for a 'No' outcome and the primary source of uncertainty in this forecast.\n2.  **Scheduling Priority:** As a major political figure, Trump's schedule is demanding. Any significant political commitment, such as a rally or major fundraiser, would almost certainly take precedence.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 65% because the recency of his last attendance is a significant counter-signal, and the potential for a last-minute scheduling conflict can never be fully discounted. My probability is not lower because the combination of the powerful personal invitation from Dana White and the extreme convenience of the location makes this specific event a low-effort, high-reward appearance that is uniquely appealing for him to attend, likely overriding concerns about appearing at two events in close succession. I would increase my forecast if credible sources report he is planning to attend. I would decrease it if a conflicting, high-profile political event is scheduled for the same evening.",
