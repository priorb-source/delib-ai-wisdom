    "review": "The deliberation revealed a strong consensus, with all three forecasters arriving at an identical probability of 15%. The core reasoning was consistently shared: the required 7.8+ point increase from the May level of 52.2 is a historically rare event. All participants correctly identified the negative recent trend and the weak underlying fundamentals—particularly the multi-decade high consumer inflation expectations and the slowing private-sector job growth—as a strong anchor for a 'No' outcome. We all also noted the conflicting signal from the Conference Board's index but correctly concluded that the University of Michigan survey's higher sensitivity to inflation and personal finances makes it more likely to remain depressed in the current environment. The other forecasters did not introduce new evidence but reinforced the key pillars of my original analysis.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 15%. The deliberation with my peers has strengthened my conviction in my initial analysis. Their reasoning mirrored my own, confirming that the key drivers for this question point strongly towards a 'No' resolution. The core of my rationale remains unchanged: for the question to resolve 'Yes', the Index of Consumer Sentiment would need to surge by nearly 8 points in a single month. As all forecasters noted, such a large increase is statistically improbable, having occurred less than 3% of the time in the 2010-2019 period. The fundamental economic data continues to support sustained low sentiment. The primary drivers for the UMich index are consumers' views on their personal finances and inflation, both of which are negative. One-year inflation expectations are at a 40-year high, private-sector hiring has slowed significantly, and financial stress is visible in rising student loan delinquencies. The consensus view that the more optimistic Conference Board report is a less relevant, divergent indicator in this specific context solidifies my confidence. I am not changing my forecast because no new arguments or evidence were presented to challenge the initial, well-supported conclusion. The 15% probability continues to appropriately account for the small chance of a significant positive economic shock, such as a sharp drop in energy prices or a major de-escalation of the trade war.",
