  "information": "As of mid-May 2025, the Los Angeles Dodgers hold a record of 29-17, leading the National League West division. The team's offense is ranked as one of the best in baseball, averaging 5.8 runs per game, with Shohei Ohtani leading the team with 16 home runs. Pre-season projections from multiple sources were high; Baseball Prospectus's PECOTA system projected 104 wins for the 2025 season, the most in MLB, while betting markets set their over/under win total at 103.5.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Dodgers have an elite record and are among the league leaders, but it is not certain they currently have the single highest winning percentage. Therefore, the status quo is that the Dodgers are a top contender but not definitively in the top spot, leaning towards a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Dodgers continue to play well but are outpaced by another elite team, like the Atlanta Braves or New York Yankees, who go on a hot streak over the next few weeks and possess a slightly higher winning percentage on June 15, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Dodgers' powerful offense, led by Shohei Ohtani, continues its torrid pace, and the team's pitching successfully navigates its injury and workload management. This combination results in a strong winning streak, securing the best record in the MLB by the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the Dodgers' position as one of the most talented teams in baseball, as supported by their high pre-season projections (PECOTA: 104 wins) and their strong start to the season (29-17 record). Their offense is performing at an elite level, averaging 5.8 runs per game, which gives them a high probability of winning any given game. However, the question sets a very high bar: having the single highest winning percentage out of all 30 MLB teams. The margin between the top 3-5 teams in the league is often razor-thin and can be decided by a single game. Given the short timeframe until resolution, short-term variance or a hot streak by a competitor (e.g., the Yankees, Braves, or Phillies) could easily result in another team holding the top spot on June 15. The provided background also mentions the team is 'navigating injuries,' which remains a persistent risk factor. My probability is not higher because of the strong competition and the statistical likelihood that one of the other 29 teams will hold the top spot. It is not lower because the Dodgers entered the season as the consensus favorite and have performed in line with those high expectations, making them the most likely single team to achieve this status. I would raise my forecast if key rivals suffered significant injuries, and I would lower it if the Dodgers were to lose a key player like Mookie Betts or Freddie Freeman to injury.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the LA Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nYahoo Sports: [Even as Dodgers navigate injuries and manage pitcher usage, the wins keep coming](https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/even-as-dodgers-navigate-injuries-and-manage-pitcher-usage-the-wins-keep-coming-053322413.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Los Angeles Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of mid-May 2025, the Los Angeles Dodgers hold a record of 29-17, leading the National League West division.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
