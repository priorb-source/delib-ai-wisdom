  "information": "Recent economic indicators point to a weak economic outlook for the Eurozone. Real GDP growth forecasts for 2025 have been subject to downward revisions. For ten consecutive months, the composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks business activity, has remained below or near the 50-point threshold separating contraction from expansion. The ECB's Wage Tracker Index indicates a rapid deceleration in wage increases from the peak observed in late 2024. This trend is expected to reduce price pressures in the labor-intensive services sector. Other disinflationary drivers include easing food inflation and a negative year-on-year contribution from energy prices.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "3-7 days. It is currently April 28, 2025, and the April 2025 inflation data for the Eurozone is typically released by Eurostat in the first few days of the following month (early May).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - inflation will be at or below 2.2%. The current economic conditions and recent trends point toward continued disinflation in the Eurozone.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The disinflationary trends continue as expected. Weak economic growth (PMI below 50 for ten consecutive months), rapidly decelerating wage growth, easing food prices, and negative energy price contributions keep inflation subdued. April 2025 inflation comes in at or below 2.2%, consistent with the downward revisions observed in February and the weak economic fundamentals.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "There is an unexpected inflationary shock in April. This could result from a sudden spike in energy prices, supply chain disruptions, or unseasonably strong services inflation driven by temporary factors. Food prices reaccelerate, or there is a statistical base effect that pushes the annualized rate above 2.2% despite underlying disinflationary pressures.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors inflation remaining at or below 2.2%. The research assistant's report highlights multiple disinflationary factors: ten consecutive months of PMI near or below 50 (indicating economic stagnation), rapidly decelerating wage growth from late 2024 peaks, easing food inflation, and negative year-on-year energy contributions. The Euro News article from March 19 specifically mentions 'downward revisions' to February inflation. These are not temporary factors but sustained trends that typically persist for multiple months. Since we are forecasting April data and it's already April 28, the month is effectively complete - the underlying price data has already been collected, just not yet compiled and released. This reduces uncertainty significantly. The status quo heavily favors continued disinflation. For the forecast to be higher, I would need evidence of recent inflationary shocks or a reversal in the wage/energy/food trends - which I don't have. For it to be lower, I would need the actual March data showing inflation well below 2.2% with strong momentum downward. Given some residual uncertainty about month-to-month volatility and the lack of exact March figures, I maintain a modest probability for the 'Yes' outcome, but the fundamentals clearly point toward 'No'.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
