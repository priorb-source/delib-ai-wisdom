  "information": "Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has stated that her government will permit a citizen-led referendum on independence in 2026 if a public petition gathers sufficient signatures. Smith has personally said she does not support separation but believes the decision should be made by Albertans. To facilitate this process, her government introduced Bill 54, which lowers the threshold for initiating a referendum from 20% to 10% of eligible voters (approximately 177,000 signatures) and extends the time for collection from 90 to 120 days. The government also formed a panel called 'Alberta Next' to explore the province's autonomy and future relationship with the federal government.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "55 days (from May 7, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no official announcement of a referendum date occurs before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The citizen-led petition process continues as designed under Bill 54, with organizers working to gather the required 177,000 signatures. Even if successful, the referendum would be scheduled for 2026 as originally planned. Premier Smith maintains her stated position of allowing the process to proceed without government interference, and no official date is announced before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Political dynamics shift dramatically in the next 55 days. Either: (1) petition organizers succeed in gathering signatures much faster than expected and the government announces a referendum date (even for 2026) before July 1, 2025; (2) a major federal-provincial crisis emerges that causes Smith to proactively schedule a referendum; or (3) overwhelming political pressure forces the government to accelerate the timeline and announce a date ahead of the citizen petition process completion.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. The research shows Alberta's framework explicitly envisions a 2026 referendum driven by citizen petition, not a government-initiated 2025 referendum. Premier Smith has positioned herself as facilitating a citizen-led process rather than proactively scheduling a referendum, giving her political cover to maintain the status quo timeline. With only 55 days remaining until July 1, 2025, there is very limited time for the petition process to complete and trigger an official announcement. Bill 54's requirements (177,000 signatures over 120 days) suggest the process will extend well into 2025 or beyond before completion. Smith's stated personal opposition to separation further reduces likelihood of proactive government action. However, the probability is not negligible because: (1) the question only requires announcing a date, not holding the referendum—so even announcing a 2026 date before July 1, 2025 would count; (2) separatist movements can accelerate quickly in response to political events; (3) unforeseen federal actions could provoke rapid provincial response; (4) petition organizers might succeed faster than anticipated. To update higher, I would need evidence of rapid petition progress, major federal-provincial conflict, or signals the government is considering proactive scheduling. To update lower, I would need clear government statements reaffirming the 2026 timeline exclusively or evidence of slow petition progress. Given the strong status quo bias, short timeline, and government's stated approach, I assess this as a low but not negligible probability event.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith has stated that her government will permit a citizen-led referendum on independence in 2026 if a public petition gathers sufficient signatures. Smith has personally said she does not support separation but believes the decision should be made by Albertans.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
