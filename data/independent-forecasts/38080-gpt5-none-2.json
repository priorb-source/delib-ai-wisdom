    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 34 days (until July 1, 2025)",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "Courts deny a TRO/preliminary injunction or an injunction is stayed on appeal; DHS maintains revocation pending administrative appeal or litigation; no negotiated settlement before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A federal court grants (and maintains through July 1) a TRO or preliminary injunction compelling DHS/ICE to restore Harvard’s SEVP certification, or DHS rescinds/reverses the revocation or reaches a rapid settlement reinstating certification before or on July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Context and status quo: As of May 28, DHS has revoked Harvard’s SEVP certification. If nothing changes, the question resolves No. With only about a month, re-certification through standard administrative channels is unlikely; the realistic paths are judicial relief or a DHS reversal/settlement.\n- Legal/institutional dynamics: Harvard is highly likely to seek emergency relief (TRO/preliminary injunction). Courts often consider irreparable harm to thousands of students and the university’s operations, and may find the agency action vulnerable under the APA if the stated grounds (e.g., “toxic campus climate”) do not map cleanly onto SEVP regulatory criteria. The 2020 ICE guidance on international students (rescinded after Harvard/MIT sued) shows both strong litigation posture from universities and the government’s willingness to backtrack under pressure. That precedent supports a meaningful chance of near-term relief.\n- Offsetting considerations: DHS may argue national security or statutory discretion, which tends to receive judicial deference, especially for immigration-related programs. If the revocation was framed as an immediate withdrawal on national security grounds, a district court could be more cautious, and even if a TRO issues, the government could seek an appellate stay before July 1. The administration’s broader confrontation with Harvard reduces the likelihood of a quick voluntary reversal.\n- Timing: TROs can be issued within days, but appellate stays can also arrive quickly. Netting these, the odds that relief is both granted and in effect on July 1 are material but far from assured.\n- Why not higher: Short timeline, deference to DHS on immigration/national security, and risk of an appellate stay. The status quo is No and deserves weight.\n- Why not lower: The harms are concrete and immediate, Harvard has substantial legal leverage, and there is a recent, closely analogous episode where similar federal action affecting international students was halted quickly under legal and political pressure.\n- What would move me up: Evidence that a district judge has granted a TRO/preliminary injunction; signs of DHS walking back the revocation; bipartisan political pressure; details showing the revocation lacks a solid regulatory basis.\n- What would move me down: A district court denial of emergency relief; an appellate stay of any injunction; credible DHS filings invoking specific, classified national security concerns; indications that internal SEVP processes must run without interim relief through July.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
