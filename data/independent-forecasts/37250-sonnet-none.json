    "rationale": "The question references a Wikipedia article about the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, indicating he was removed from the United States. With no additional information from the research assistant, I must rely on base rates and the status quo. The current state is that he is outside the US following deportation, and the default expectation is that this continues. Several factors weigh heavily against a return within 2 months: (1) Deportations typically come with multi-year reentry bans that create legal barriers, (2) obtaining legal permission to return after deportation is a lengthy process that typically takes much longer than 2 months, (3) while illegal reentry is theoretically possible, it involves significant risk and uncertainty, and (4) there is no information suggesting active efforts, special circumstances, or pending legal proceedings that would facilitate his return. The very short timeframe of only 2 months makes a return even less likely than the already-low base rate for deportees returning. My forecast is not lower (closer to 0%) because unexpected developments can occur - humanitarian situations, legal developments, or successful illegal border crossing remain within the realm of possibility over a 2-month period. My forecast is not higher because the status quo strongly favors him remaining outside the US, and there is zero evidence of plans or circumstances that would lead to his return. I would update significantly upward if credible reporting emerged about pending legal authorization, active travel plans, or attempts to cross the border. I would update downward if reporting confirmed he has no intention or ability to return.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kilmar Abrego Garcia return to the United States before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Kilmar_Abrego_Garcia)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kilmar Abrego Garcia after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of the United States according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nSubsequently leaving the United States, such as a deportation, will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
