    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I underweighted in my initial analysis. They correctly emphasize that 46 days is an extraordinarily short window - not just for implementing a major federal reorganization, but even for completing the legislative process required for such a change. Forecaster 2's point about the tracker maintainers being unlikely to mark something this significant as 'complete' based on preliminary actions is particularly persuasive. I had noted this uncertainty but may have overweighted the possibility of a permissive completion standard. Forecaster 3's invocation of historical base rates for major reorganizations is also strong evidence I didn't adequately consider. Both forecasters provide more disciplined reasoning about what 'complete' would actually mean for breaking up a major agency - it would require not just announcements or executive orders, but actual implementation, which is nearly impossible in this timeframe. Their forecasts of 3% and 6% better reflect the structural and procedural constraints than my initial 18%.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too optimistic about three key factors: (1) The 46-day timeline is even more constraining than I initially weighted - major federal reorganizations typically take years, not weeks; (2) Breaking up NOAA requires legislative action to reassign statutory authorities and funding, not just executive directives, making the timeline even more unrealistic; (3) Community tracker maintainers maintaining a public spreadsheet would likely require clear evidence of accomplished reorganization, not just announced intentions or preliminary actions, to mark something 'complete.' The current 'in progress' status suggests significant work remains, and moving from 'in progress' to 'complete' in 46 days for something this complex is extremely unlikely. However, I retain some probability above 3% because there remains slight uncertainty about tracker standards and a small possibility of unexpected rapid action or permissive interpretation. I'm updating down substantially to better align with the strong structural arguments provided by the other forecasters.",
