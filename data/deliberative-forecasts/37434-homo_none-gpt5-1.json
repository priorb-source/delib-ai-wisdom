    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short time window and the lack of acute triggers (defaults/accelerations, forbearance expirations, operational shutdowns, advisor retention/DIP talk) as key reasons to keep the probability modest, which aligns with my prior. They add a useful lens on event cadence—i.e., that imminent filings are typically preceded by 8‑K breadcrumbs—which I implicitly assumed but didn’t state as clearly. They also highlight vendor/landlord enforcement risk as a fast‑moving catalyst. Neither introduced new concrete facts (e.g., runway guidance from the 3/27 release, new financings, or default notices). Overall, their reasoning is consistent with mine and does not provide new evidence that would materially change the estimate.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~8 weeks. Base rates for a bankruptcy filing within such a short window are low even for distressed microcaps, as they often bridge via small equity/convertible raises, stretch payables, or informal creditor accommodations. AquaBounty’s long‑standing losses, halted/paused expansion, and reliance on external financing keep the hazard nontrivial. However, without evidence of acute catalysts (recent 8‑Ks showing default/acceleration, announced failed financings, operational shutdowns, or advisor/DIP signaling), the odds of an actual petition before July 1 remain modest. The 3/27/25 press release likely reiterated financing needs, but absent explicit disclosure of runway expiring in May/June, I favor a No within this window. I do not see new arguments or data from the other forecasters that warrant a material change; their analyses largely corroborate my initial view.",
