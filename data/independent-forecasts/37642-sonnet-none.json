    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6-7 weeks. The question resolves on July 1, 2025, and today is May 14, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the Federal Reserve maintains its current interest rate policy without cuts",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Fed continues its recently announced pause on rate cuts through June 2025. Economic data shows persistent inflation or robust economic activity that doesn't warrant immediate rate cuts. The Fed maintains its wait-and-see approach at any remaining FOMC meetings before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Fed announces a rate cut at an upcoming FOMC meeting (likely in June 2025) in response to either: deteriorating economic conditions, rising unemployment, clear sustained evidence that inflation is under control and returning to the 2% target, or financial market stress requiring monetary easing.",
    "rationale": "The short timeframe is critical here - with less than 7 weeks until resolution, there are limited opportunities for the Fed to act. The FOMC typically meets 8 times per year (roughly every 6 weeks), meaning there would likely be only one scheduled meeting before July 1, 2025, probably in mid-June. The question background explicitly states the Fed recently decided to 'pause rate cuts,' indicating a deliberate shift away from an easing cycle. This suggests current economic conditions - whether inflation concerns, labor market strength, or GDP growth - don't currently warrant cuts. The status quo bias strongly favors continuation of this pause, as central banks typically move deliberately and require substantial evidence before policy shifts. For a rate cut to occur in this tight window, we'd need either: (1) a significant unexpected deterioration in economic data, (2) a financial crisis or market dislocation, or (3) surprisingly weak inflation data that gives the Fed high confidence. However, the Fed is data-dependent and could act if circumstances warrant. The probability isn't negligible because economic conditions can change, and the Fed has shown willingness to move when necessary. My forecast isn't higher because: the recent pause signals no immediate urgency to cut, the timeframe allows for only one likely meeting, and the Fed typically requires sustained evidence before reversing course. My forecast isn't lower because: economic data could weaken substantially in 6 weeks, one meeting is still one opportunity to cut, and the Fed could act decisively if warranted. I would update higher with: significant labor market weakness, financial stress indicators, or clear disinflationary trends. I would update lower if: upcoming inflation data shows persistence, GDP growth remains strong, or Fed officials signal continued patience.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement. Therefore, the effective date of the rate cut does not need to be before the resolution date, as long as the announcement is made before then.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
