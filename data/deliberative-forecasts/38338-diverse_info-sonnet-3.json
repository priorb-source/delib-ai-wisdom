    "review": "Both forecasters raised critical arguments I initially underweighted. Forecaster 2's point about Morgan's historical base rate is particularly compelling - he publicly considered gubernatorial runs in 2018 and 2022 but didn't follow through. This is a strong predictor I completely missed. Forecaster 3's calendar timing insight is also crucial: July 1, 2025 is actually BEFORE the natural announcement window (post-July 4) for a 2026 race that's still 16+ months away. For a wealthy self-funder like Morgan, there's little structural pressure to announce this early. Both noted the absence of concrete pre-launch signals (no campaign manager hires, no exploratory paperwork filed, no scheduled announcement events) which I mentioned but underweighted. Forecaster 3's point about recent field developments (Jolly announced June 5, others entering) potentially encouraging Morgan to 'wait and watch' rather than rush is also persuasive. These are strong arguments that I failed to properly integrate into my initial forecast.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I overestimated the probability by insufficiently weighing the base rate and calendar timing arguments. Morgan's pattern of public consideration without follow-through (2018, 2022) is the single most predictive factor available. The May 15 Politico article shows serious exploration, but 'laying out a campaign blueprint' for a 'possible run' is consistent with his past behavior of serious consideration without commitment. The July 1 deadline is poorly positioned - it's just before the traditional post-July 4 announcement window, and there's no campaign urgency for a 2026 race. With less than 4 weeks remaining and zero concrete campaign infrastructure signals (no staff hires, no filings, no scheduled events), the status quo of 'no announcement' is highly likely to persist. I maintain slightly higher probability than Forecasters 2 and 3 because: (1) the Politico article suggests more concrete planning than previous cycles, (2) Morgan's self-funding capability enables rapid mobilization, and (3) 24 days remains sufficient time for an announcement if a decision is made. However, the base rate and timing arguments compel me to update significantly downward from my initial 32%.",
