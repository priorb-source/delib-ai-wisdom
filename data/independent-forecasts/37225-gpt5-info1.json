  "information": "The most recent poll, conducted on April 22, 2025, projects the Progressive Reform Party (VHP) winning 29% of seats, the National Democratic Party (NDP) 24%, and the National Party of Suriname (NPS) 14%. An earlier poll from January 2025 showed the NDP at 54% and the VHP at 29%. The incumbent VHP, led by President Chandrikapersad Santokhi, aims to secure at least 26 of the 51 available seats in the National Assembly. The opposition NDP has publicly ruled out any post-election collaboration with the VHP.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 4–6 weeks (election expected in late May 2025; official results shortly thereafter)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — based on the latest available poll showing VHP leading in projected seats",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The NDP consolidates opposition voters and outperforms in interior/rural districts where seat-vote disproportionality favors them, translating a modest national vote lead into the largest seat tally.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "VHP holds or improves its urban strongholds (e.g., Paramaribo, Wanica, Nickerie), while opposition votes fragment among NDP, ABOP, NPS, and smaller parties, allowing VHP to edge out a plurality of seats even with a low overall share.",
    "rationale": "Timing: With roughly a month to the vote and quick counting thereafter, there is limited time for fundamentals to shift dramatically.\nStatus quo: The most recent (Apr 22, 2025) poll cited by the assistant projects VHP at 29% of seats versus NDP at 24%, implying a VHP plurality. I overweight this near-term snapshot while acknowledging Suriname polling is sparse and often noisy, and the seat system (multi-member districts) can deviate from national vote shares.\nEvidence summary from assistant: April poll: VHP 29% (projected seats), NDP 24%, NPS 14%; January poll had NDP far ahead (54%) with VHP at 29%. Incumbent VHP (Santokhi) targets at least 26/51 seats. NDP says it won’t collaborate with VHP post-election (coalitions don’t affect this question, which is about plurality, not government formation).\nWhy not higher: (1) Volatility and contradictory polling (January showed a large NDP lead), (2) economic headwinds and public discontent could penalize the incumbent, (3) district-level disproportionality could advantage NDP if their support is efficiently distributed.\nWhy not lower: (1) The latest poll shows VHP in front on seats, (2) opposition fragmentation (NDP/ABOP/NPS/others) increases the chance VHP wins a low-plurality seat lead, (3) incumbency and established urban bases can be resilient.\nWhat would move me up: Multiple, credible district-level polls showing VHP leading in key multi-member districts; signs of further opposition fragmentation; improving economic sentiment. What would move me down: Convergent polling showing NDP ahead in seat-rich districts; new scandals or economic shocks hurting VHP; evidence of NDP consolidating smaller opposition parties’ voters in the interior.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Progressive Reform Party win the most seats in the 2025 Surinamese general election?\n\nQuestion background:\nGlobal Americans: [Suriname After Bouterse](https://globalamericans.org/suriname-after-bouterse/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Progressive Reform Party of Suriname wins a plurality of seats in the [2025 Surinamese general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Surinamese_general_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe most recent poll, conducted on April 22, 2025, projects the Progressive Reform Party (VHP) winning 29% of seats, the National Democratic Party (NDP) 24%, and the National Party of Suriname (NPS) 14%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
