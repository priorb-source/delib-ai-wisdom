    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic continues to access ample private capital and refrains from any public IPO signaling—no public S-1 appears on EDGAR and no News post on anthropic.com/news announces IPO plans—through June 30, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic either files a public S-1 visible on the SEC’s EDGAR system or posts on its News page that it is planning an IPO (including announcing a confidential S-1 submission) before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: With only ~1.5 months left, the default is that nothing changes. Companies rarely announce IPO plans on such a short fuse without prior, visible setup (banker mandates, media reports, or regulatory filings). The specified resolution channels (public S-1 or an Anthropic News post) make the bar concrete and easy to miss if they stay quiet.\n- Funding environment: Anthropic has had access to large strategic and private capital rounds, reducing pressure to go public immediately. That diminishes the necessity of an IPO announcement in the near term.\n- Process realities: Public S-1s typically follow months of preparation. While a confidential submission could precede a public filing, the question only resolves Yes if there’s a public S-1 or an explicit News post. Many firms avoid pre-announcing IPO intent to minimize scrutiny and maintain flexibility.\n- Why not higher: Short timeline; no visible signals (bank mandates, credible media reports, or company hints); viable private financing alternatives; and potential downsides to early disclosure (market and regulatory scrutiny).\n- Why not lower: The IPO window for tech has reopened somewhat, AI remains a hot theme, and Anthropic’s capital needs for compute are substantial. A company in this position could choose to accelerate and signal intent (via News post or public S-1) to position for a later 2025/early 2026 debut.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of Anthropic hiring IPO underwriters; leaks of a confidential submission accompanied by an official News post; any Anthropic News page item stating intent to go public; a public S-1 on EDGAR; or a flurry of successful AI/infra IPOs improving the window.\n- What would move me down: Announcement of a new large private round or strategic financing that defers the need for IPO; explicit statements that Anthropic won’t pursue an IPO in 2025; or a sharp deterioration in market conditions.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information was provided beyond the prompt; thus the forecast leans on general market/practice patterns and the short time remaining.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
