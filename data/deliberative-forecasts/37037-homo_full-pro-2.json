    "review": "The other two forecasters have presented compelling analyses that align with my own but with a slightly higher degree of confidence. We all agree on the core drivers of this forecast: the strength of the status quo with the tariff already in effect, the extremely short timeline until resolution, and the powerful negative signal sent by the U.S. explicitly excluding Lesotho from a 90-day tariff pause offered to others. Forecaster 2 made an excellent point that I had not fully weighted: the policy's application to 185 countries makes it much harder to grant an early exception to Lesotho, as it would undermine the new policy's credibility and invite challenges from others. Forecaster 3 articulated a key counterargument very clearly: that reversing the tariff on Lesotho could be a 'low-cost way for the U.S. to appear reasonable' amidst larger trade disputes. This captures the primary scenario for a 'No' outcome. Their reasoning is highly convincing and reinforces the high probability of a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am increasing my forecast from 85% to 90%. The consensus among us on the primary factors—the enacted policy, the short timeline, and Lesotho's specific exclusion from the pause—strengthens my conviction. I was particularly persuaded by the argument that making an immediate exception for Lesotho would set a damaging precedent for a new policy intended to apply to 185 countries. This bureaucratic and political inertia is likely stronger than I initially estimated. While I still believe the 'low-cost concession' scenario is plausible and prevents me from going higher than 90%, the explicit decision to exclude Lesotho from the initial round of pauses suggests the U.S. has already considered the poor optics and decided to proceed regardless. Reversing that specific decision in less than six weeks seems unlikely. Therefore, I am adjusting my probability upward to reflect a greater confidence in the status quo holding through June 1, 2025.",
