  "information": "India has a history of large-scale demonstrations that have exceeded 10,000 participants, including the farmers' protests of 2020-2021 and the anti-CAA protests of 2019-2020. The Global Protest Tracker recorded 145 anti-government protests worldwide in the 12 months preceding May 2025. Reports also indicate that authorities in India have used technologies such as drones with facial recognition to identify participants in farmer protests and subsequently confiscate their passports.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months remain until July 1, 2025 (from May 2, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - if current conditions persist without major escalation, no protest meeting all the specific criteria (10,000+ participants, reported by Global Protest Tracker, starting after question launch, before July 1) would occur",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Protests in India remain below the 10,000 participant threshold, or large protests occur but are not captured/reported by the Global Protest Tracker before July 1, or government crackdowns successfully prevent mass gatherings from forming through surveillance technology and preemptive actions",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recent Muslim land law protests escalate into larger demonstrations exceeding 10,000 participants, or a separate issue (such as farmer grievances, religious tensions, or economic concerns) triggers a major protest movement that reaches the threshold and is documented by the Global Protest Tracker within the next two months",
    "rationale": "India has demonstrated capacity for large-scale protests, with the farmers' protests (2020-2021) and anti-CAA protests (2019-2020) both exceeding 10,000 participants. The country's 1.4 billion population and active civil society make large protests feasible. The recent Reuters report of violent protests over Muslim land law (with 3 deaths) indicates current social tensions that could escalate. However, several factors moderate the probability: (1) The timeframe is short at only 2 months, limiting opportunities for protest formation and organization; (2) The 10,000+ participant threshold is substantial and not all protests reach this size; (3) The specific reporting requirement means the Global Protest Tracker must document it, and not all protests may be captured in their dataset; (4) The Indian government has demonstrated sophisticated protest suppression capabilities, including drone surveillance with facial recognition and passport confiscation, which could prevent large gatherings from forming. The Global Protest Tracker recorded 145 anti-government protests worldwide in 12 months, suggesting selective reporting of major events. My forecast is not higher because the combination of short timeframe, high participant threshold, and specific reporting source creates significant hurdles. It's not lower because India's protest history, recent tensions, and large population create meaningful probability of a qualifying event. I would revise upward if: protests over the Muslim land law continue to grow, new flashpoint issues emerge, or regional tensions escalate. I would revise downward if: current protests dissipate, government crackdowns intensify successfully, or we approach late June without any major protest movements forming",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in India with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nA protest with at least 10,000 participants that is active at the launch of this question does not count for resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIndia has a history of large-scale demonstrations that have exceeded 10,000 participants, including the farmers' protests of 2020-2021 and the anti-CAA protests of 2019-2020.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
