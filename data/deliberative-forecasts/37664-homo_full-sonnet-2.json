    "review": "Both forecasters make strong arguments that cause me to reconsider my initial assessment. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes the naming convention uncertainty and status quo bias, though they made a calculation error (stating only 2 months since Claude 3 when it's actually 14 months). Forecaster 3 provides particularly valuable insights about the narrow 45-day window and the risk that even a brief waitlist or early access period would disqualify the resolution. All three of us converged around 50-60%, which suggests reasonable consensus on the core uncertainties. The most compelling new consideration is Forecaster 3's point about how tight the timeline really is - 45 days leaves very little margin for the typical delays in tech releases, and any minor setback could push past July 1. Additionally, both forecasters appropriately emphasize that we have zero confirmation that 'Claude Neptune' will actually be branded as 'Claude 4' rather than 'Claude 3.5' or another designation.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I weighted the Neptune reports too optimistically relative to the significant uncertainties. The 45-day window from May 16 to July 1 is genuinely narrow - even if Neptune releases in 'late May or early June' as reported, any delay of just a few weeks would exceed the deadline. The naming uncertainty remains the critical unknown: while Anthropic used 'Asimov' internally before releasing Claude 3, there's no confirmation Neptune will be called Claude 4. The 'later in 2025' framing from multiple tech publications could easily mean Q3/Q4 rather than May-June. Furthermore, the resolution criteria are strict - even a brief early access period would disqualify it. Balancing these against the specific Neptune reports (red-team completion May 18, targeted late May/early June release), Anthropic's strong track record of rapid general releases, and the 14-month gap suggesting readiness for a major version, I'm moving my forecast down slightly. The evidence still slightly favors YES given the specific near-term reports, but the narrow window and naming uncertainty deserve greater weight than I initially assigned.",
