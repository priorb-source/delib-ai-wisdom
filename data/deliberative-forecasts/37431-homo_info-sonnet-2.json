    "review": "Forecaster 3 raised an important point I overlooked: while frozen products may be easier to track initially, they create a significant verification challenge because they can remain in consumer freezers for extended periods, making it harder for FSIS to confirm effective removal from commerce before closing the recall. Forecaster 3 also noted the 2.5-month production window, which increases distribution complexity beyond what I initially considered. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the NY-only distribution is valid, though I think the 30% forecast underweights the base rate data showing median closures around 70 days (our deadline is day 68). The tension between Forecasters 2 and 3 on frozen products is illuminating - Forecaster 3's concern about consumer freezer retention affecting closure verification is more relevant to the specific question of when FSIS will formally close the recall, not just when recovery efforts are complete. All three of us cluster in the 30-42% range, suggesting reasonable consensus that the limited scope provides some acceleration but not enough to overcome typical bureaucratic timelines.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was slightly overoptimistic in my initial forecast. The frozen product characteristic is indeed a double-edged sword - while easier to track through retail channels, it complicates the final verification stage because products can remain in consumer possession for months, delaying FSIS's ability to confirm effective recall completion. The 2.5-month production window also suggests broader distribution over time than a single-batch scenario would entail. However, I maintain that the NY-only geographic limitation remains a significant positive factor that shouldn't be understated - this genuinely simplifies the logistics compared to nationwide recalls. The base rate data remains my anchor: with a median closure around 70 days and our deadline at day 68, we're just slightly faster than median, suggesting probability near but below 50%. The limited scope pulls this upward, while the frozen retention issue and extended production window pull it downward. Balancing these factors, I'm adjusting down from 42% to 39%, acknowledging the legitimate complications raised by Forecaster 3 while not fully adopting Forecaster 2's more pessimistic view of bureaucratic timelines.",
