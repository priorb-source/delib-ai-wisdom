  "information": "As of early May 2025, Muqtada al-Sadr has publicly and repeatedly reaffirmed his boycott of the 2025 Iraqi parliamentary election. In April 2025, he rejected a plea from the Iraqi President to reconsider his decision, stating he would not participate with 'the corrupt'. In March 2025, he forbade his followers from voting or participating in the election. A Qatari report from late April indicated al-Sadr is unwilling to take responsibility for the political mistakes of the rival Shia Coordination Framework. During a speech on May 2, 2025, he told supporters to 'speak out if their speech benefits reform, and remain silent if silence benefits reform.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Muqtada al-Sadr's Alliance Towards Reforms party continues its declared boycott and does not announce participation in the 2025 election.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Muqtada al-Sadr maintains his firm public stance against participating in the election with what he calls 'the corrupt.' He continues to see more political benefit in boycotting and positioning himself as an outsider than in participating. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without any announcement of participation from his party.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant political shift occurs, such as major concessions from the rival Shia Coordination Framework or a change in electoral law that al-Sadr deems sufficient for 'reform.' Alternatively, seeing his rivals consolidating power unopposed, he makes a last-minute tactical reversal, announcing his participation to rally his base and challenge the status quo from within the system.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by Muqtada al-Sadr's recent, repeated, and firm public statements confirming his boycott of the 2025 elections. As the research indicates, he rejected a plea from the Iraqi President in April 2025 and forbade his followers from participating in March 2025, citing the presence of 'the corrupt' and his unwillingness to share responsibility for the mistakes of the rival Shia Coordination Framework. The status quo, which I weigh heavily, is a clear and consistent boycott. With less than two months until the deadline, the window for a reversal is closing rapidly. The probability is not zero because al-Sadr is a notoriously unpredictable political actor known for dramatic reversals if he perceives a tactical advantage. A significant political crisis or a major concession from his rivals could precipitate such a change. However, my forecast remains low because reversing such a strong, public stance would require a very compelling reason, and there is currently no evidence of one emerging. I would increase this forecast if there were credible reports of high-level negotiations or if key Sadrist demands were met. I would decrease it further if additional deadlines for election registration pass without Sadrist action.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
