  "information": "In late 2024 and early 2025, Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks, increasing its cash position to $348 billion by May 2025. The company reduced its holdings in Apple by 50% and also sold shares in Bank of America and Citigroup. New positions were initiated in Constellation Brands, while existing stakes in Occidental Petroleum, SiriusXM Holdings, Pool Corp, and Verisign were increased. During the first quarter of 2025, Berkshire's purchases included additions to Verisign, Sirius XM, and Occidental Petroleum, as well as an estimated $2.7 billion investment in five Japanese trading houses.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway first purchased 1.27 million shares of Domino's Pizza in the third quarter of 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, it increased this stake to a total of 2,382,000 shares, with the investment's value growing from $549 million to $1 billion. Multiple news articles from early May 2025, published after Berkshire's annual meeting, reported that the company had further increased its stake in Domino's Pizza to 7%.\n\nFor its first fiscal quarter of 2025, Domino's Pizza reported a 0.5% decline in U.S. same-store sales and missed revenue forecasts, but it exceeded earnings per share expectations. During that same quarter, the company repurchased 115,000 of its own shares. The company's 'Hungry for More' strategy aims to open over 1,000 new stores annually until 2028 and achieve 7% annual sales growth. As part of this strategy, Domino's is set to begin a collaboration with DoorDash in 2025, following a previous partnership with Uber Eats in 2023.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. The 13F filing for the period ending 2025-03-31 is due 45 days after the quarter's end, on or around May 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo is Berkshire Hathaway holding the 2,382,000 shares reported at the end of Q4 2024. Holding this exact number would not be 'greater than' 2,382,000 shares, resulting in a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The multiple news reports from early May 2025 are inaccurate, or the purchases they refer to were made after the Q1 reporting period ended on March 31. Despite increasing its stake in Q4 2024, Berkshire paused further purchases in Q1 2025, potentially as part of its broader strategy of being a net seller of stocks to increase its cash position.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The news reports from early May 2025 are accurate and reflect activity within Q1 2025. Berkshire Hathaway continued the accumulation pattern seen in late 2024 and purchased additional shares of Domino's Pizza between January 1 and March 31, 2025, increasing its holding beyond 2,382,000 shares. This increase is subsequently revealed in the Q1 13F filing.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the research indicating that multiple news articles in early May 2025 reported Berkshire Hathaway had increased its stake in Domino's Pizza to 7%. These reports surfaced just after the company's annual meeting, a time of high scrutiny and information flow. A 7% stake would represent a significant increase over the 2,382,000 shares held at the end of Q4 2024, thereby triggering a 'Yes' resolution. This new information aligns with Berkshire's prior actions, as they initiated a position in Q3 2024 and then nearly doubled it in Q4 2024, establishing a clear trend of accumulation. While Berkshire was a net seller of stocks overall during the quarter, the report also notes they were selectively increasing other positions (e.g., Occidental, Verisign), which demonstrates a willingness to buy stocks where they have high conviction. The Domino's purchase would fit this pattern.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 95% because there remains a small possibility that the news reports are inaccurate or that the timeline is misunderstood—for example, the purchases could have occurred after the March 31 cutoff and therefore would not appear in the Q1 filing. \n\nMy forecast is not lower because the combination of a clear accumulation trend over the previous two quarters and multiple, specific news reports from reputable sources constitutes very strong evidence. To forecast a lower probability would be to unduly discount this recent and highly relevant information.\n\nI would decrease my forecast if these news reports were retracted or corrected. I would increase it if an official source, like Berkshire Hathaway itself, confirmed the Q1 purchase ahead of the filing.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
