    "review": "Both forecasters reinforced key constraints I had noted—short timeline, multiple procedural steps, and South Sudan’s limited legislative bandwidth—but added sharper emphasis on two points: (1) the deposit with the AU often slips even when domestic approval occurs, and (2) tail-end non‑ratifiers have low near‑term hazard rates absent explicit executive fast‑tracking and a place on the legislative docket. They also flagged parliamentary scheduling/recess risk as a concrete downside trigger and correctly discounted the business summit as non-evidentiary for procedural readiness. I find these arguments convincing and directionally consistent with my view, suggesting I was a bit high given the lack of concrete signals.",
    "rationale": "We have roughly two months for cabinet approval, legislative passage, any required presidential assent, and formal deposit with the AU before July 1. There are no public signs (order paper, committee reports, cabinet memo, or AU Secretariat notices) that ratification is in the pipeline. South Sudan’s competing priorities and history of slow legislative throughput reduce the likelihood that all steps, including the often-overlooked deposit, will be completed on time. A rapid ‘Yes’ remains possible if the executive decides to fast‑track and align deposit timing for signaling benefits, but without evidence of such prioritization, the base rate for tail‑end ratifiers in a short window is modest. Incorporating the others’ emphasis on deposit slippage and docket visibility, I’m nudging my estimate down.",
