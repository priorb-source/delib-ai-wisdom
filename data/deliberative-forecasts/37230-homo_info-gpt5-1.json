    "review": "Both forecasters ground their views in the monthly base rate (~56–60%) and weigh near-term catalysts appropriately. Useful additions beyond my initial take: (1) Forecaster 2’s mechanical point about how April 30’s close shifts the hurdle for May is important; (2) both highlight the late-April rebound and elevated valuations as reasons to shade down from the base rate; (3) they bring in VIX near ~25, implying wider tails. I disagree with Forecaster 2’s claim that there is no May FOMC meeting—there typically is one in early May (Forecaster 3 places it on May 7), so policy-event risk is present. Forecaster 3 also usefully notes post-earnings buybacks supporting the tape. Overall, their arguments are largely convincing, with the VIX/valuation/retracement risk pushing modestly lower than my prior, while the Fed/earnings/inflation prints remain two-sided.",
    "rationale": "I continue to anchor on the monthly positive drift (high-50s base), but I’m incorporating: (a) a strong late-April rebound that can invite mean reversion, (b) elevated implied vol (VIX ~25) raising downside sensitivity to negative surprises, and (c) a live early-May FOMC plus mid-month CPI that could skew equities if yields back up. Offsetting these are resilient earnings so far, potential for post-earnings buybacks to provide support, and the absence of a clearly identified imminent macro shock beyond the known data/Fed events. The unknown April 30 reference close adds path dependency; a high April finish would slightly lower May-up odds, while a dip would do the opposite. Net, I trim my prior 57% down modestly to reflect the higher bar and volatility but keep it above 50% given drift and supportive micro. I will move higher on cooler inflation plus benign Fed/persistent earnings strength; lower on hot prints, higher yields, or notable mega-cap guidance disappointments.",
