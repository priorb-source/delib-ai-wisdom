    "review": "The other two forecasters reached the same conclusion as me, identifying the same four key barriers to ratification: the extremely short two-month timeline, Libya's severe political fragmentation, the competing priority of a bilateral trade agreement with Turkey, and the lack of urgency due to the slow implementation of AfCFTA itself. This strong consensus across all three analyses reinforces the core reasoning and increases my confidence in a very low probability forecast. No new evidence was presented, but Forecaster 2's slightly lower forecast of 3% prompted me to reconsider the weight of the existing barriers. The arguments are highly convincing and collectively paint a picture of near-impossibility for ratification within the specified timeframe.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 5% to 3%. The deliberation process did not introduce new evidence, but it reinforced the profound severity of the existing obstacles. All three of us agree on the core factors: the two-month deadline is almost impossibly short for any country, let alone one with Libya's ongoing political crisis. The stated focus on a free trade deal with Turkey diverts critical political and administrative resources. Finally, the slow pace of AfCFTA's own implementation (e.g., rules of origin not due until October 2025) removes any external pressure for a rushed ratification. I am decreasing my probability because the discussion solidified my view on the political fragmentation. It is not just a hurdle but a fundamental paralysis of the state's ability to perform legitimate legislative functions like treaty ratification. For a 'Yes' to occur, not only would one faction have to push it through, but that action would need to be seen as a legitimate and binding act of the Libyan state by the African Union. The probability of resolving this deep-seated legitimacy crisis and completing the ratification process in under two months is exceedingly remote. The 3% probability better reflects this near-insurmountable combination of procedural, political, and strategic barriers.",
