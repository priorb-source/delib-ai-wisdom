    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds two valuable points I underweighted: (1) resolution hinges on an 8‑K filed before July 1, and even if the deal is terminated late in June the 4‑business‑day window could push the filing into July; and (2) presidential CFIUS prohibitions are historically very hard to overturn, making a quick termination plausible if enforcement proceeds. Their 65% leans heavily on the premise that a formal, enforceable prohibition exists and will not be stayed. Forecaster 3 rightly highlights uncertainty about whether there is, in fact, a signed, effective presidential order and emphasizes the short time window plus status‑quo inertia; that tempers near‑term collapse odds even if the eventual failure risk is high. I find F2’s legal-history argument persuasive, but I share F3’s skepticism about the factual premise of an already-issued block with a June 18 enforcement date. The 8‑K timing nuance from F2 lowers pre–July 1 odds a bit; F3’s caution about the existence/effectiveness of a formal order also argues for trimming. Overall, I’m between them, closer to my prior but nudged down slightly by the 8‑K timing risk and uncertainty over the order’s status.",
    "rationale": "Key drivers within a ~6‑week window:\n- If there is an already-issued presidential prohibition that becomes enforceable around June 18 and no court stay is granted, historical precedent suggests the parties would terminate promptly and file an 8‑K in June. That path yields a high conditional probability of a Yes resolution.\n- If there is no formal, enforceable order by mid‑June (or a court issues a stay), status‑quo incentives dominate: both parties and activists will keep optionality alive; termination before July 1 becomes unlikely.\n- Even with termination late in June, the 4‑business‑day 8‑K deadline could slip the filing into July, which matters for resolution.\n\nMy rough scenario weights: moderate probability that a formal order is (or becomes) effective by mid‑June but nontrivial uncertainty about that premise; conditional on effectiveness, a stay is possible but not likely; conditional on no stay, termination would likely be prompt enough for a June 8‑K. Balancing these with the filing‑timing risk leads me to edge my forecast down slightly from 44% to 42%.\n\nUpward movers: clear confirmation of an effective presidential prohibition taking hold by June 18 without a stay; company signals of imminent termination. Downward movers: any court stay/injunction; credible reporting that the order does not require abandonment yet; indications of timeline extensions or continued mitigation talks that push formal termination beyond June.",
