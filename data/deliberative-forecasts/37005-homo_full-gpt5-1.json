    "review": "Both forecasters convincingly flag a key issue I underweighted: the research assistant’s report appears internally inconsistent with the fixed Oct 2025 election date (advance voting “8 days to go” in April) and contradicts the well‑documented late‑2024 polling landscape that had the CPC well ahead. That undermines the report’s credibility and removes the basis for my high prior. They also appropriately re‑center on fundamentals (incumbency fatigue, affordability/housing salience, leader approvals, fundraising) and regional path constraints (Ontario 905, Bloc dynamics in Quebec, NDP squeeze). I find their reasoning largely persuasive. If anything, I think they may slightly underweight tail scenarios (leadership or major campaign shocks), but their skepticism about a rapid reversal to 172+ is well founded.",
    "rationale": "I’m discarding the assistant’s projection of 188–196 Liberal seats as likely erroneous given timing and conflict with prior polling/aggregator baselines. Reverting to the late‑2024 status quo: the Conservatives held a persistent national lead that translated in models to a likely CPC plurality or majority, with Liberals well short of 172. From that baseline, a Liberal path to ≥172 requires: (1) a sizable and sustained turnaround in national vote; (2) dominant Ontario performance, especially in the GTA/905; (3) improved position in Quebec relative to the Bloc; and (4) efficient vote consolidation vs. the NDP in urban/suburban ridings. While not impossible over six months, this is a high bar given fundamentals and recent trends.\n\nUncertainty remains: Canadian campaigns can swing on leadership, scandals, or salient policy moves, and FPTP can amplify regional shifts. Those tails keep the probability above near-zero. But without credible evidence of a durable Liberal resurgence (e.g., multi‑week national/ON leads and model medians near/above 170), the base case is that they fall short of 172.\n\nAccordingly, I update sharply downward from my prior, retaining a modest tail for a late realignment or leadership-driven reset.",
