    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 week (13F due by 2025-05-15)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — recent Berkshire 13Fs (through 2024) consistently showed roughly 10.7 million AMZN shares; if unchanged, Q1 2025 will still report >10,000,000.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire trims the AMZN position to below 10,000,000 shares during Q1 2025, or obtains confidential treatment and omits AMZN from the public 13F, resulting in no reported holding >10,000,000.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire leaves the AMZN stake unchanged around ~10.7 million shares or adds to it; either way, the Q1 2025 13F reports >10,000,000 shares.",
    "rationale": "With about a week until the filing deadline, the base case is that Berkshire’s AMZN stake remains unchanged. Historically, Berkshire’s Amazon position (managed by a deputy, not Buffett) has been stable around ~10.7M shares across multiple quarters through 2024. The resolution criterion is lenient: it only requires the reported position be >10,000,000 shares, not necessarily that it increased. Thus, maintaining the stake would resolve Yes. Risks that would lead to No include a meaningful trim that takes the position below 10M (roughly a 6%+ reduction from ~10.7M) or Berkshire obtaining confidential treatment and temporarily omitting AMZN from the 13F. While trims are possible given AMZN’s strong performance, Berkshire tends to be low-turnover in such smaller positions, and a threshold-crossing reduction is not my base case. This forecast is not higher because I allow for a non-trivial chance of a trim or confidentiality. It is not lower because the last known share count was already over the threshold and Berkshire’s pattern is to leave this stake steady. I would update upward if credible pre-filing reporting indicated the AMZN position remained unchanged or increased, or if someone verified the Q4 2024 13F still showed ~10.7M shares. I would update downward on any credible report of a Q1 trim in AMZN, signs Berkshire sought confidential treatment for AMZN, or an early 13F/press item suggesting sales in large-cap tech holdings. The research assistant provided no additional info, so the forecast leans on base rates and prior 13F levels.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Amazon stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nStockCircle: [Berkshire Hathaway's Amazon Stake](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett/amzn/transactions)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 10,000,000 shares of Amazon.com, Inc.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
