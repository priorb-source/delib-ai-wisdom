    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No referendum date is announced",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Republika Srpska leadership continues with political rhetoric and threats but stops short of actually announcing a referendum date. International pressure from the EU and US, along with pragmatic economic and political considerations, prevents escalation to the point of formally scheduling a referendum. The status quo of tensions without concrete action continues through the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milorad Dodik or another RS authority with power to do so announces a specific date for an independence referendum, potentially emboldened by Russian backing, domestic political pressures, or as a response to a crisis with the central Bosnian government. The announcement happens regardless of its legality under Bosnian law, meeting the question's criteria.",
    "rationale": "The question requires only an announcement of a referendum date by RS authorities before July 1, 2025 - a 2-month window from today. Several factors inform my assessment: First, while Milorad Dodik has repeatedly threatened independence referendums over the years, actually scheduling one represents a significant escalation that he has not yet taken. This historical pattern suggests rhetoric often exceeds action. Second, the base rate for such announcements is very low - formally scheduling independence referendums in disputed territories is a rare and dramatic political event. Third, strong international opposition from the EU and US typically constrains such moves, creating significant economic and diplomatic costs. The article background mentions Russian influence, which could potentially embolden RS leadership, but this alone doesn't indicate imminent action. Fourth, we have no concrete information suggesting an announcement is imminent within the next 60 days. If this were truly on the horizon, we would likely see preparatory political moves, statements, or reporting. The status quo strongly favors no announcement given how world events typically unfold slowly. My forecast is not higher because there's no evidence of imminent action and the timeframe is short. It's not lower because Dodik has a history of provocative moves, Russian influence is mentioned as a factor, and the question only requires announcement (not actual holding) of a referendum, which is a lower bar. I would update higher if: RS authorities begin making concrete statements about timing, Russian support becomes more explicit, or a major crisis erupts between RS and the central government. I would update lower if: the deadline approaches without developments, international pressure visibly increases, or Dodik moderates his rhetoric.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
