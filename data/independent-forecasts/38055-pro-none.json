    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 to 2 months. UFC 316 is a future event, likely scheduled for mid-to-late summer 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The fight between Joe Pyfer and Kelvin Gastelum is scheduled for UFC 316. In the status quo, the fight proceeds, and Pyfer, as the likely betting favourite, secures a victory.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The scheduled fight is cancelled due to injury, illness, or weight-cutting issues for either fighter. Alternatively, the fight takes place, but Pyfer loses via knockout, submission, or decision, or the bout ends in a draw or no-contest.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The fight proceeds as scheduled at UFC 316, and Joe Pyfer defeats his opponent by decision, knockout, or submission.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is a product of two key probabilities: the likelihood of the fight taking place, and the likelihood of Joe Pyfer winning if it does. \n\nFirst, the probability of the fight occurring. The background information states the fight is booked for UFC 316. However, MMA fights have a significant cancellation rate due to injuries, illnesses, and weight-management complications. The fact that this is a rebooked fight underscores this very risk. I estimate there is approximately an 85% chance that the fight goes ahead as scheduled. If Pyfer does not fight, the question resolves as No.\n\nSecond, the probability of Pyfer winning. Assuming his opponent is Kelvin Gastelum, this is a competitive match. Pyfer is a powerful, ascending middleweight with momentum on his side. Gastelum is a highly experienced and durable veteran who has faced top-tier competition, though he has had mixed results recently. Pyfer would likely enter the fight as a moderate favorite. I assess his conditional probability of winning, given the fight happens, at approximately 65%. Gastelum's experience and resilience make him a very credible threat, preventing a higher confidence in Pyfer.\n\nCombining these factors (0.85 * 0.65) results in a final probability of 55.25%.\n\nThis forecast is not higher because of the dual risks of fight cancellation (a ~15% chance) and Pyfer losing to a tough veteran opponent (a ~35% chance). It is not lower because the fight is officially booked and Pyfer's current career trajectory and skillset rightfully make him the favorite to win. \n\nI would update this forecast upwards as the fight date nears without any reported issues. Conversely, any news of an injury to either fighter or a particularly difficult weight cut for Gastelum would cause me to update the forecast downwards.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
