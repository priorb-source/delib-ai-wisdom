  "information": "A state of emergency was declared in Samoa on March 31, 2025, due to a severe energy crisis. The declaration was scheduled to be in effect for 30 days, from April 1, 2025, through April 29, 2025.\n\nAccording to reports from Samoa NewsHub and the Samoa Observer, temporary generators were expected to be operational by the end of April, coinciding with the scheduled end of the state of emergency. However, the permanent solution to the power crisis is not anticipated to be in place until August 2025.\n\nAs of April 21, 2025, the Samoan government had not announced any plans to extend the state of emergency. The National Emergency Operation Centre's update on April 15 confirmed that emergency orders were valid until April 29. The crisis has had a significant economic impact, estimated at a 16% hit to the country's GDP.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 days until April 30, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the state of emergency is scheduled to end on April 29, 2025, one day before the question date",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The state of emergency ends as scheduled on April 29, 2025, and is not extended or renewed. Temporary generators come online as planned, alleviating the immediate crisis sufficiently that the government decides no emergency declaration is needed on April 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Samoan government announces an extension of the state of emergency beyond April 29, or the temporary generators fail to materialize or prove insufficient, prompting the government to declare a new state of emergency that is in effect on April 30.",
    "rationale": "The state of emergency was explicitly scheduled to run from April 1-29, 2025, ending one day before the question date. Several factors support the status quo (NO) outcome: (1) The government set a specific 30-day timeline that ends April 29; (2) Temporary generators were expected to be operational by end of April, which aligns with the planned end date; (3) As of April 21, with only 8 days remaining before the scheduled end, no extension has been announced; (4) The April 15 government update reaffirmed the April 29 end date. Good forecasting practice requires giving substantial weight to the status quo, and the default path is that the emergency ends as planned. However, uncertainty remains because: (1) The permanent solution isn't expected until August 2025, suggesting ongoing vulnerability; (2) The crisis caused a severe 16% GDP impact; (3) Temporary generators might not be ready or sufficient; (4) The government still has 9 days to announce an extension. For me to update higher toward YES, I would need to see: announcements of extension plans, reports that generators won't be ready, or worsening conditions. For me to update lower, I would need: confirmation of operational generators, government statements reaffirming the April 29 end date, or clear improvement in the power situation. The most likely scenario is that the government planned this 30-day period to bridge until temporary solutions were in place, and barring unexpected developments, it will end as scheduled.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count. (Note that when it was declared, it was scheduled to be in effect through April 29, 2025.)\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA state of emergency was declared in Samoa on March 31, 2025, due to a severe energy crisis.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
