    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the key dynamic: high policy inertia over a one‑month horizon and explicit political ownership, versus a nontrivial resolution risk that hinges on the exact wording on the specified BC Hydro page. New angles they introduced: (1) broader policy backdrop of domestic preference/retaliatory measures (e.g., end of federal iZEV, tariffs, liquor moves) that favors continued exclusion; (2) lower political cost to keep Tesla excluded given recent Tesla headwinds and protests; and (3) the possibility that legal/communications norms could push BC Hydro to remove brand names in favor of generic country‑of‑origin language. I find the macro‑policy points supportive of continuation, while the legal/communications caution about brand‑specific mentions is the most relevant downside for this specific resolution. The market-share and protest points slightly reinforce the “no pressure to reverse” view but are secondary to the web‑copy criterion.",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution is about a month, and the exclusion was just enacted and publicly defended. That strongly favors continuation of the underlying policy through July. The decisive uncertainty is not policy but whether the specified page will still explicitly name “Tesla” as ineligible on/after July 1. Governments often avoid brand callouts; if BC Hydro’s web team generalizes to “U.S.-produced goods are ineligible” or relocates the Tesla notice to a different page, the question would resolve No despite unchanged policy. Balancing these: I assign a very high chance the exclusion remains in effect by July (~95%) and a somewhat lower chance that the exact page still carries an explicit Tesla callout (~84%). Multiplying implies ~80%. This is a slight trim from my prior 82% to give a bit more weight to the brand‑mention/web‑copy risk highlighted by the others, while recognizing the political and timing context still favors a Yes outcome.",
