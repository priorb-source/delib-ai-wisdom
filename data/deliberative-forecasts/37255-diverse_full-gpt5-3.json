    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the very short timeline, Libya’s divided institutions, and the current policy focus on bilateral trade with Turkey rather than AfCFTA. Their arguments largely mirror my prior reasoning, but they push harder on procedural inertia and the lack of urgency given unresolved AfCFTA rules of origin. I didn’t see new hard evidence, but I find their framing of administrative bandwidth and legislative sequencing persuasive. The suggestion that a sudden executive move is possible but unlikely aligns with my triggers for moving up. Overall, their lower baselines make me reassess whether my 15% was too generous given the absence of concrete signals (e.g., cabinet approval, HoR scheduling, AU deposit chatter).",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is about two months, and the default outcome is non-ratification. Libya’s fractured governance likely requires HoR action for formal treaty ratification, which is slow and politically fraught. There are no public indicators of imminent movement (no announced cabinet approval, no parliamentary agenda, no AU statements). The AfCFTA’s staggered implementation and pending rules of origin reduce near-term payoff, lowering incentives to rush ratification before July 1. Libya’s current trade narrative centers on a bilateral push with Turkey and a possible free trade zone—compatible with AfCFTA but suggestive of limited administrative bandwidth for a multilateral ratification sprint. A small upside path remains if the executive attempts a fast-track deposit timed with AU events and the AU accepts the instrument despite domestic contention. Given peers’ points and the lack of fresh positive signals, I’m nudging my estimate down from 15% to 9%. I would move up on credible reports of cabinet clearance, HoR scheduling/voting, or AU Secretariat indications of imminent deposit; I would move down on signs of legislative paralysis, explicit deprioritization, or escalation of political crisis limiting parliamentary sittings.",
