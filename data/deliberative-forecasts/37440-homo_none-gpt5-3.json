    "review": "Both peers largely mirror my reasoning on timing, GOP trifecta, NVRA/legal headwinds, and the enactment trigger. The new wrinkle they added that I hadn’t highlighted is the possibility that proof-of-citizenship language could be tucked into an omnibus late in session, which modestly raises the chance it passed without much notice. Conversely, they emphasize the Senate’s caution and the rarity of a special session on this topic before July 1—points I agree with and that weigh No absent confirmation of passage. Neither provided concrete evidence of passage or death, so the updates are about weighting, not new facts.",
    "rationale": "We’re just past Florida’s 60-day session, so the key uncertainty is whether a qualifying bill cleared both chambers before sine die. If it did, enactment before July 1 is very likely (DeSantis would sign or allow it to become law). If it did not, the path is a special session, which is possible but uncommon for this standalone issue on a tight timeline. Legal exposure under the NVRA and operational burdens make Senate caution plausible; Florida might prefer back-end database verification, which wouldn’t satisfy the question. Balancing: (a) a nontrivial chance the House moved a bill and language was included in a late vehicle (omnibus possibility), vs. (b) base-rate that controversial election changes with litigation risk stall late in session, I estimate ~30% chance it passed plus a small residual (~5–10%) chance via special session. That yields a blended probability in the low-to-mid 30s. Given session timing and no confirming reports of passage, I trim my prior slightly downward.",
