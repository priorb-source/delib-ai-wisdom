    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. Forecaster 2 estimates a 55% probability, arguing that easier reporting and public interest have increased the baseline, and that summer seasonality will push the number of reports over 400. However, this analysis appears to lack the most recent monthly data, which shows a significant downward trend in sightings since 2021, contradicting the assumption of a continually rising baseline. Forecaster 3 provides a forecast of 33%, which is much closer to my own. Their reasoning is very insightful, aligning with my assessment of a sub-400 baseline but adding excellent detail on potential spike catalysts (Starlink, solar maximum) and a crucial counterpoint: that increased public familiarity with phenomena like Starlink is likely dampening reporting spikes. I find Forecaster 3's reasoning highly convincing and complementary to my own.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 30% was based on the clear downward trend in NUFORC reports for June over the past few years (434 in 2021, 340 in 2022, 267 in 2023), establishing a status quo well below the 400 threshold. The deliberation has reinforced my conviction in this reasoning. Forecaster 2’s argument for a higher baseline seems inconsistent with the most recent and relevant data. Conversely, Forecaster 3’s analysis solidifies my position by providing a strong explanatory mechanism for the downward trend: growing public awareness of common aerial phenomena like Starlink satellites, which likely reduces the number of mistaken reports compared to the peak in 2020-2021. This strengthens the argument that the new, lower baseline is stable. At the same time, Forecaster 3's specific enumeration of potential spike catalysts (high Starlink launch cadence during summer twilight, proximity to the solar maximum increasing aurora potential) provides a concrete justification for the non-trivial probability of exceeding the threshold. My original 30% forecast was intended to balance the strong evidence of a sub-400 baseline against the inherent volatility and possibility of a media- or event-driven spike. The new arguments have confirmed that this balance is appropriate. Therefore, I am not changing my forecast.",
