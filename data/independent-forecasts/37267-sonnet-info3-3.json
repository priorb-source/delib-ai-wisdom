  "information": "On May 1, 2025, the U.S. announced sanctions related to renewed violence in the Tigray and Amhara regions. Ethiopia has neighboring countries, specifically Sudan and South Sudan, that are already under a Level 4 advisory. As of early May 2025, there have been no reports of a new nationwide offensive, a coup attempt, or a mass-casualty event involving foreigners since the sanctions were announced.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ethiopia maintains its current travel advisory level without escalation to Level 4",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The renewed violence in Tigray and Amhara regions remains localized and contained. No major incidents involving American citizens occur. The State Department continues monitoring the situation but does not escalate to a Level 4 advisory. The Ethiopian government maintains sufficient control to prevent nationwide conflict.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Violence in Tigray and Amhara escalates dramatically and spreads to other regions including Addis Ababa. A major terrorist attack, coup attempt, or mass-casualty event involving foreigners occurs. The security situation deteriorates so rapidly that the State Department determines Ethiopia poses an imminent threat to American travelers and issues a Level 4 advisory.",
    "rationale": "Level 4 travel advisories are rare and reserved for the most extreme situations - active war zones, complete state collapse, or areas with imminent threats to American lives. Currently, only a handful of countries worldwide hold this designation. While Ethiopia faces renewed violence in Tigray and Amhara regions leading to May 1st sanctions, my research assistant specifically notes there have been NO reports of nationwide offensives, coup attempts, or mass-casualty events involving foreigners since these sanctions. The 2-month timeframe is relatively short for such a dramatic policy shift. Ethiopia has managed internal conflicts for years without reaching Level 4 status, even during previous periods of significant violence. The State Department typically moves slowly and incrementally through advisory levels. However, I cannot dismiss this possibility entirely because: (1) sanctions were just announced indicating serious US concern, (2) neighboring Sudan and South Sudan already have Level 4 advisories showing regional instability, (3) the situation could deteriorate rapidly, and (4) two months is technically sufficient time for emergency escalation if a catastrophic event occurs. My forecast is not higher because of the rarity of Level 4 advisories, the lack of recent major incidents, and the status quo bias that situations typically change gradually. It's not lower because of the recent sanctions, ongoing violence, and regional instability. I would update higher with reports of: attacks on foreigners, nationwide conflict spread, or major terrorist incidents. I would update lower with: sustained stability reports, peaceful conflict resolution, or de-escalation signals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ethiopia receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Is Ethiopia Safe for Travel?

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
