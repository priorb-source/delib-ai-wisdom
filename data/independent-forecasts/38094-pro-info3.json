  "information": "Senator Fetterman's office has experienced significant staff turnover, with reports from The Jewish Voice and Fox News indicating that at least seven staffers have resigned. These departures include high-level aides such as his Communications Director and Legislative Director. Several of these resignations have been linked to policy disagreements, particularly Fetterman's staunch pro-Israel stance, which former staffers described as consuming the office's work environment and being 'less nuanced' than their own views.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month (resolves on July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, Senator Fetterman will continue to caucus with the Democrats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite significant policy disagreements with his party's progressive wing and high staff turnover, Senator Fetterman continues to caucus with the Democrats past the deadline. He values the platform and structural support the party provides, and finds the political cost of switching parties or resigning to be too high.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing friction with the Democratic party, particularly over foreign policy, combined with a sense of political isolation, leads Senator Fetterman to make a decisive break. This could manifest as either a resignation from the Senate, citing personal or health reasons, or a formal change in his party registration to Independent or Republican.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong tendency of the political status quo to persist. It is exceptionally rare for a U.S. Senator to switch parties or resign mid-term outside of a major scandal or health crisis. Senator Fetterman has also explicitly stated he will not resign, which is a strong piece of evidence against that specific scenario. While his maverick positions, particularly his staunch pro-Israel stance, have caused significant friction and led to high-level staff departures as noted in the research, this is more indicative of internal conflict than an imminent break with the caucus. Many senators (e.g., Manchin, Sinema) have had public, long-running disagreements with their party without ceasing to caucus. The political incentives for Fetterman to remain a Democrat are immense, as his entire political identity and voter base are tied to the party. A switch would be a politically perilous move with an uncertain future. My probability is not lower than 7% because the situation appears genuinely volatile. The reports of his anger, isolation, and the departure of key staff suggest a level of discontent and dysfunction that is not typical and slightly increases the tail risk of an unexpected decision from an unconventional politician. I would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of him actively negotiating with Republican leadership or if he publicly walked back his statement about not resigning. I would decrease my forecast if he were to hire prominent mainstream Democratic staffers or engage in public reconciliation efforts with the party.",
