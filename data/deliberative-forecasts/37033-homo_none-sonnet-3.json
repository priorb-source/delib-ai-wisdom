    "review": "All three analyses converge on similar reasoning with forecasts between 20-32%, suggesting good calibration around the key evidence. Forecaster 2 raises the most compelling argument I had underweighted: the 5-year gap between the 2020 agreement and the first 2025 payment is an extremely strong historical signal about Zimbabwe's payment velocity. This dramatically undermines expectations of rapid successive payments. Forecaster 3's point about potential monthly payment schedules is reasonable and prevents the forecast from being even lower, though it remains speculative without evidence. All forecasters correctly identify the operational payment mechanism as the main positive signal, but appropriately weight the short timeframe and lack of evidence for imminent payments more heavily. The consensus cluster around 20-32% appears well-justified by available evidence.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should weight the 5-year gap more heavily than I initially did. This is the strongest historical baseline we have for Zimbabwe's payment velocity on this specific compensation program. While I correctly noted that the payment mechanism is now operational, the enormous delay from agreement to first payment suggests systemic constraints that won't be overcome in 38 days. The April 10 reaffirmation, occurring one day after the first payment, now seems more like routine political messaging than evidence of imminent action. The research assistant finding 'no additional information' is particularly telling - if a second payment were imminent, we would expect some evidence in reporting or government statements. The small payment size could indicate tranches, but doesn't tell us their frequency. Without evidence of payment schedules, monthly disbursements, or allocated funds for May, the probability should favor status quo. I'm revising down from 28% to 25% to better reflect the strength of the 5-year gap argument while maintaining some probability for the scenarios where operational payment systems and reaffirmed commitment lead to faster second payments than the historical baseline would suggest.",
