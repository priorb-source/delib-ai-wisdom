    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling mathematical arguments that I underweighted in my initial analysis. Their calculation that the recent rate of ~8 deaths/month would project to 16 additional deaths by July 1 - more than triple the 5 needed - is particularly persuasive. The intensified operations approved on May 5 strengthen this case. However, Forecaster 3 raises an important risk I didn't adequately consider: OCHA might stop publishing snapshots before July 1, which would lock us at 295 (No resolution). This is explicitly covered in the resolution criteria and represents a meaningful downside scenario that both other forecasters only briefly mention. Forecaster 3's consideration of verification lags and potential downward revisions is also valid, though less likely. Both forecasters are more confident than I was, and the trend data supports higher confidence, but I believe the OCHA publication risk and the possibility of dramatic operational changes (major UN withdrawal, unexpected ceasefire) warrant staying somewhat below their 88-90% range.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating upward but not to their levels. The mathematical case is stronger than I initially assessed: with only 5 deaths needed over 57 days, and recent rates of 8/month or 2-3/week, the probability of reaching 300 is high. The March 19 to April 30 period saw 15 deaths in just 42 days (0.36/day), and projecting this forward yields ~20 deaths by July 1. The May 5 intensification announcement makes the near-term especially dangerous. However, I'm weighting three risks more heavily than the other forecasters: (1) OCHA stopping publications before July 1, locking us at 295, (2) the possibility of a rapid de-escalation or ceasefire in the next 2 months, and (3) significant UN operational withdrawal reducing exposure. These scenarios are individually unlikely but collectively represent meaningful probability mass. The OCHA publication risk is particularly important given the resolution mechanism. I'm updating from 78% to 84%, acknowledging the strong trend data while maintaining that the risks warrant staying below 90%.",
