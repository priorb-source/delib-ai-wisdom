    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About two weeks (≈15 days)",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "No China trip is scheduled or announced in the remaining window; engagement with Xi occurs via calls or third-country meetings instead, or is deferred to later in 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden bilateral breakthrough triggers an expedited, announced trip to Beijing/another Chinese city within days, or a rapidly organized Asia swing includes a China stop before June 30.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates: US presidential trips to China are rare (often zero or one per term) and planned well in advance. A visit within the next ~15 days would almost certainly already be credibly rumored or announced.\n- Lead-time/logistics: State or even working visits to China require significant diplomatic, security, and protocol preparation and are typically publicly signaled at least days to weeks ahead. Surprise stops are highly uncommon for China.\n- Calendar constraints: No obvious multilateral events in China in the remainder of June that would naturally bring the US President there.\n- Information environment: The research assistant reports no additional information (no announcements/leaks). In a world where such a trip were imminent, we’d expect concrete signals by now.\nWhy not higher: The narrow time window, absence of credible reporting, and the logistical/precedential hurdles strongly favor No.\nWhy not lower: A small chance remains that a rapid breakthrough prompts an expedited visit, or that an already-planned but undisclosed Asia itinerary adds a China stop.\nWhat would change my view upward: Authoritative announcements from the White House or China’s MFA, credible media leaks about an imminent Beijing trip, sightings of US advance teams, or scheduling of a last-minute bilateral summit in China.\nWhat would change my view downward: Continued lack of signals through the coming week or reports that any near-term Asia travel will not include China.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit China before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFox News: [Trump touts 'very positive' breakthrough with Xi after slamming China for trade violation](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-touts-very-positive-breakthrough-xi-after-slamming-china-trade-violation) | Wikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after this question opens and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits China.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
