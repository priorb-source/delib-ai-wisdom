  "information": "On May 21, 2025, Kneecap member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (also known as Mo Chara) was charged with a terrorism-related offence under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charge relates to an allegation that he displayed a Hezbollah flag during a concert in London in November 2024. A court date at Westminster Magistrates' Court has been set for June 18, 2025, approximately one week before the Glastonbury festival is scheduled to begin. The band has publicly denied the charge, describing it as 'political policing'.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command is formally investigating the band over footage from two separate events. One investigation concerns a video from a 2024 concert where a band member allegedly said, 'The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.' Another investigation relates to a 2023 concert where a band member appeared to chant, 'up Hamas, up Hezbollah.' Following public backlash, the band issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess. Several UK politicians and government ministers have publicly called for Glastonbury to remove Kneecap from the festival's lineup.\n\nAs of late May 2025, Kneecap remains officially listed on the Glastonbury 2025 lineup for the West Holts stage, and festival organizers have not issued any public statement regarding the controversies or the recent charge. Several venues and European festivals, including the Eden Project, Plymouth Pavilions, and Germany's Hurricane and Southside festivals, have cancelled Kneecap's scheduled appearances. However, other events have proceeded; London's Wide Awake Festival confirmed the band would still perform on May 24, and the band played a surprise gig in London on May 22, the day after the terrorism charge was made public.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Slightly over one month. The festival is scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Kneecap is currently listed on the official Glastonbury 2025 lineup.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury organisers remove Kneecap from the lineup due to the escalating political pressure and the legal and reputational risks associated with a band member being charged under the Terrorism Act 2000. This could also be a result of police advice or bail conditions preventing the member's attendance.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the significant controversy, political pressure, and legal proceedings, Glastonbury organisers decide to stand by the band, allowing the performance to proceed as scheduled, potentially as a statement on artistic freedom or due to contractual obligations.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is 35%. Although Kneecap remains on the official lineup (the status quo), the probability of them performing has been significantly reduced by recent events. The primary factor driving this low probability is the extremely serious charge brought against band member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh under the Terrorism Act 2000. This elevates the situation from a controversy over provocative art to an issue of national security and criminal law. This presents a severe reputational, legal, and security risk for an event the size of Glastonbury, which works closely with police and authorities. This risk is amplified by public calls from politicians for the band's removal and the precedent set by several other UK and European venues and festivals that have already cancelled Kneecap's appearances. This wave of cancellations makes it much more likely Glastonbury will follow suit to mitigate its risk. \n\nThe probability is not lower because Glastonbury has a strong counter-cultural identity and a history of resisting political pressure. The organisers have not yet cancelled the performance, suggesting they are either committed to the booking, are waiting for the outcome of the June 18 court date, or are carefully weighing their options. There is a real possibility they will brave the controversy. \n\nThe probability is not higher because the combination of a formal terrorism charge, precedents of cancellation by other festivals, and intense political pressure creates a formidable obstacle. The security implications of platforming an artist in this legal situation at an event for over 200,000 people are likely to be deemed unacceptable by the organisers or their security partners.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 21, 2025, Kneecap member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (also known as Mo Chara) was charged with a terrorism-related offence under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
