    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Niger maintains its current travel advisory level (likely Level 3 - Reconsider Travel) through July 1, 2025, without escalation to Level 4",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Niger's security situation remains at current levels or improves slightly. While terrorism, crime, and limited medical infrastructure remain concerns, the State Department does not assess conditions as meeting the threshold for Level 4 (Do Not Travel). No major incidents involving American citizens or dramatic security deterioration occur in the next two months.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major security incident occurs in Niger - such as a significant terrorist attack, kidnapping of Westerners, direct threat to US interests, escalation of conflict with neighboring countries, or complete breakdown of governmental control - prompting the State Department to immediately upgrade Niger to Level 4 before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Niger faces substantial security challenges including terrorism threats in the Sahel region, the aftermath of the July 2023 military coup, and strained relations with Western countries. The article reference suggests ongoing concerns about terrorism, crime, and medical care. However, several factors favor the status quo: (1) Strong base rate effect - travel advisory changes are relatively rare and typically occur in response to specific triggering events; (2) Short timeframe - only 2 months remain, limiting opportunity for the necessary deterioration or incident; (3) If conditions truly warranted Level 4, the upgrade likely would have occurred already, particularly given nearly 2 years since the coup; (4) Level 4 advisories are reserved for the most extreme situations - active warfare, complete security breakdown, or imminent threats to Americans. Neighboring countries like Mali and Burkina Faso have Level 4 advisories, but Niger's situation appears somewhat more stable. Without information from the research assistant indicating Niger's current exact level or recent developments, I must rely on reasonable inference that Niger likely has Level 3 status given the security concerns mentioned. The probability is not lower because the Sahel region remains genuinely volatile and unexpected attacks do occur. The probability is not higher because status quo bias is very strong over short timeframes and major escalatory events, while possible, are not the modal outcome. To update higher, I would need evidence of imminent threat, recent major incidents, or explicit signals from State Department about reviewing Niger's status. To update lower, I would need confirmation of current Level 1-2 status or significant positive security developments.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Niger receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Niger Faces Growing Travel Risks: U.S. Travel Advisory Highlights Terrorism, Crime, and Limited Medical Care for Tourists in the Country](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/niger-faces-growing-travel-risks-u-s-travel-advisory-highlights-terrorism-crime-and-limited-medical-care-for-tourists-in-the-country/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Niger has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Niger.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
