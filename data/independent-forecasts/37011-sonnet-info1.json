  "information": "The 2025 Derbyshire County Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025. This election will use new divisional boundaries, increasing the total number of seats from 61 to 64. Elections for the council operate under a First-Past-The-Post system. According to an assessment, the Conservative Party holds 57 of the 64 seats under the new boundaries. Reform UK currently holds zero seats on the council.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days until the election on May 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservative Party retains the most seats on Derbyshire County Council, maintaining their dominant position",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives lose some seats but retain plurality, with Reform UK possibly gaining several seats but falling well short of winning the most. Labour or other parties could also gain ground without Reform UK achieving the highest seat count",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unprecedented political earthquake occurs where Reform UK wins at least 33 seats (or enough to exceed all other parties) through a massive collapse in Conservative support combined with exceptional Reform UK ground campaign effectiveness across dozens of electoral divisions",
    "rationale": "The status quo heavily favors a No outcome. The research shows Conservatives currently hold 57 of 64 seats under the new boundaries, while Reform UK holds zero. For Reform UK to win the most seats, they would need to gain at least 33 seats (for an absolute majority) in just 10 days, starting from no existing council presence. This would require winning pluralities in at least half the electoral divisions using the First-Past-The-Post system. While Reform UK has gained national prominence and polling strength, several structural factors make this extraordinarily unlikely: (1) Local elections strongly favor incumbents with established organizations; (2) Building winning coalitions in 33+ individual divisions within 10 days is nearly impossible; (3) The magnitude of swing required (57-0 to losing/tied) has no precedent in UK local elections; (4) Local recognition and campaigning infrastructure take time to build. The probability is not zero because politics can produce surprises, and the BBC noting an 'unusual' campaign suggests some volatility. However, even if Reform UK performs exceptionally well and gains 10-15 seats (which would itself be remarkable), they would still fall far short of winning the most seats. For me to increase this forecast, I would need evidence of: massive Reform UK ground operations in Derbyshire, polling showing them competitive in most divisions, or major Conservative scandals. To decrease it further, I would need confirmation of strong Conservative or Labour campaigning that leaves Reform UK without viable pathways",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Reform UK win the most seats in the 2025 Derbyshire County Council election?\n\nQuestion background:\nBBC: ['Unusual' election campaign under way in Derbyshire](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg41lzylq64o)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Reform UK controls the most seats following the [2025 Derbyshire County Council election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Derbyshire_County_Council_election)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe 2025 Derbyshire County Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
