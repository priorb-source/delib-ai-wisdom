    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The website is currently online and functional. Government websites have high persistence and inertia, so the default expectation is that it will remain online in the short term.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A new political directive resulting from a change in administration priorities leads to the site being deliberately taken offline. Alternatively, a major, unresolved technical failure or a targeted cyberattack could make the site inaccessible on the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The status quo prevails. NOAA, as a major federal agency, continues its public information mission and the Climate.gov website remains funded, maintained, and online without any major political or technical interruptions.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. Major government websites like Climate.gov are persistent due to institutional inertia and their role in fulfilling the agency's mission. The timeframe until resolution is very short (about six weeks), which makes significant changes less likely. The website is currently operational. The primary risk factor, as indicated by the provided background link, is political. A new administration hostile to climate science could order the site's removal. While the Trump administration from 2017-2021 did remove or alter climate information, it did not take down the entire Climate.gov domain, setting a precedent for modification over outright removal. Thus, even under a politically hostile scenario, a complete takedown is not the most probable outcome. My probability is not higher than 95% to account for this non-zero political risk and the small but ever-present possibility of a critical technical failure or a targeted cyberattack coinciding with the resolution check. My probability is not lower because the bureaucratic inertia of a large federal agency like NOAA makes the rapid removal of a flagship public website a difficult and slow process, one that is unlikely to be initiated and completed within the next six weeks. I would lower my forecast upon credible news of a specific directive to remove the site or a series of similar takedowns of other government climate resources. I would raise it if the administration publicly affirmed its support for NOAA's climate communication work.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA's Climate.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNational Security Archive: [Disappearing Data: Trump Administration Removing Climate Information from Government Websites](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/climate-change-transparency-project-foia/2025-02-06/disappearing-data-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Climate.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
