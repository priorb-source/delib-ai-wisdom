  "information": "On May 1, 2025, Labor Day events in Istanbul included authorized marches and unauthorized protests. According to the Istanbul Governor's Office, authorized marches in the Kadıköy and Kartal districts had a combined participation of around 65,000 people. Authorities deployed over 52,000 police officers. Clashes occurred during attempts to hold unauthorized demonstrations, particularly near Taksim Square, leading to the detention of 384 people. A court later ordered the release of 374 of those detained, while others were released on bail or remained in custody.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - if the Global Protest Tracker does not report the May 1 events or any subsequent protests meeting the criteria",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The May 1, 2025 Labor Day events are classified by the Global Protest Tracker as authorized commemorative marches rather than protests, or the unauthorized protests near Taksim Square are determined to have had fewer than 10,000 participants. No other protests exceeding 10,000 participants occur between now and July 1, or any that do occur are not captured by the Global Protest Tracker's reporting.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker reports on the May 1, 2025 Labor Day events and classifies them as protests with 10,000+ participants (either the authorized marches with ~65,000 combined participants, or determines the unauthorized demonstrations met the threshold). Alternatively, Turkey experiences another wave of protests in the next 55 days related to political, economic, or social issues that attracts 10,000+ participants and is documented by the tracker.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant reports significant Labor Day activity on May 1, 2025, with authorized marches totaling ~65,000 participants and unauthorized protests resulting in 384 detentions. The critical uncertainty is whether the Global Protest Tracker will report these events as 'protests' meeting their criteria. The authorized marches may be classified as commemorative Labor Day events rather than protests, though Turkey's Labor Day has historically been a focal point for political demonstrations. The unauthorized protests near Taksim Square clearly constitute protest activity but may not have reached 10,000 participants individually. The existence of a Wikipedia article titled '2025 Turkish protests' suggests elevated protest activity this year. Turkey has a history of significant protests (Gezi Park 2013, various political demonstrations), and with 55 days remaining, there's meaningful probability of additional large protests related to ongoing political tensions, economic conditions, or social grievances. However, I'm not forecasting higher than 55% because: (1) it's unclear whether the May 1 events meet the Global Protest Tracker's specific reporting criteria, (2) the authorized marches may not be classified as protests, (3) the unauthorized protests may have been too small individually, and (4) large protests (10,000+) are relatively rare events even in countries with active protest movements. I'm not forecasting lower because: (1) the May 1 events provide a concrete possibility, (2) Labor Day demonstrations in Turkey are traditional protest venues, (3) there's nearly two months for additional protests, and (4) the Wikipedia reference suggests active protest conditions. I would update higher if I learned the May 1 events are definitively being tracked or if political/economic tensions escalate significantly. I would update lower if I confirmed the May 1 events won't be reported or if the domestic situation stabilizes substantially.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 Turkish protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Turkish_protests)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nPlease note that the Global Protest Tracker uses the name Türkiye in its database.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 1, 2025, Labor Day events in Istanbul included authorized marches and unauthorized protests.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
