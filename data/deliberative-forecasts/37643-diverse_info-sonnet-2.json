    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable analyses, but Forecaster 3 raises critical new evidence that significantly undermines the 'Yes' scenario. Forecaster 3's evidence about the Negotiated Rulemaking Committee scheduled for June 30-July 2, 2025 is particularly damning - the government is actively planning to REFINE the program through a formal committee process that straddles the resolution deadline. This is fundamentally incompatible with termination within the same timeframe. You don't convene a negotiated rulemaking committee to modify a program you intend to terminate in six weeks. Forecaster 2's mention of a March 7 executive order directing agencies to propose changes is also useful context, confirming that administrative actions to date focus on narrowing eligibility rather than termination. Both forecasters agree on the statutory barrier and the tracker's conservative completion standard. Forecaster 3's 1% forecast appears more justified given the rulemaking committee evidence, while my original 8% and Forecaster 2's 8% may have been too generous to unlikely scenarios.",
    "rationale": "The scheduled Negotiated Rulemaking Committee meeting from June 30-July 2 is dispositive evidence that the administration is pursuing program modification, not termination. Convening such a committee requires significant planning and signals a long-term administrative approach incompatible with imminent termination. This scheduled meeting directly contradicts any scenario where the program is marked 'complete' for termination by July 1. The 47-day timeframe remains prohibitively short for Congressional action. While I initially weighted residual uncertainty at 8%, the rulemaking committee evidence suggests government actions are moving in the opposite direction from termination. I should update significantly downward but maintain small probability for: (1) unexpected legislative surprise in a must-pass bill, (2) the tracker having an unexpectedly loose interpretation of 'complete,' or (3) cancellation of the rulemaking committee coupled with sudden executive action. These scenarios remain extremely unlikely but not impossible enough to warrant 0%.",
