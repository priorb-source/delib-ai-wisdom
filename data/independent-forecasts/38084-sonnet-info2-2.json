  "information": "In late May 2025, the National Weather Service issued extreme heat watches and advisories for several inland regions of California, with temperatures forecasted to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center also forecasted higher-than-usual temperatures across much of the state for the summer of 2025. NOAA's outlook indicated that the ongoing drought would likely persist through the end of August, with an above-normal risk for significant wildfires from June through August.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "30 days (resolution date is June 28, 2025, and today is May 29, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - drought conditions persist or worsen through June 28, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Unexpected significant rainfall events occur in early June, improving drought conditions enough to drop the number of residents in drought areas below 20 million. Alternatively, the current drought may be less geographically widespread than suggested, with fewer than 20 million residents currently affected and conditions remaining stable or improving slightly.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Current drought conditions persist as NOAA forecasts predict, with extreme heat and no significant precipitation in the next 30 days. The drought continues to affect large population centers and remains at or above the 20 million resident threshold through late June. Given California's dry season typically runs through summer, this represents continuation of the status quo.",
    "rationale": "The timeframe for this question is extremely short - only 30 days until resolution. This heavily favors status quo conditions persisting. My research assistant's report indicates several factors strongly supporting a Yes outcome: (1) NOAA's Climate Prediction Center forecasts the drought will persist through end of August 2025, (2) Extreme heat watches are already issued for late May with temperatures exceeding 100°F, (3) The SF Gate article characterizes the drought as having 'returned and already bad', (4) Late June falls squarely in California's dry season when significant precipitation is highly unlikely. California has approximately 39-40 million total residents, so 20 million represents about 50% of the population - a substantial but not unprecedented threshold for a statewide drought. The main uncertainty is the exact current population living in drought areas, which I cannot verify without accessing the Drought Monitor directly. However, given the characterization as 'already bad' and NOAA's multi-month persistence forecast, it is highly probable the threshold is already met or will be met by June 28. My forecast is not higher (85-90%) because: I lack specific current data on the exact population affected, there's always some weather unpredictability over 30 days, and the 20.0 million threshold is quite specific. My forecast is not lower (60-70%) because: the timeframe is very short, multiple authoritative sources predict continued drought, we're in the dry season, and no significant rainfall is forecasted. I would update higher if I could verify current populations in drought are already well above 20 million. I would update lower if unexpected weather patterns brought significant early-summer precipitation (highly unusual) or if current drought populations were confirmed to be well below the threshold.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn late May 2025, the National Weather Service issued extreme heat watches and advisories for several inland regions of California, with temperatures forecasted to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
