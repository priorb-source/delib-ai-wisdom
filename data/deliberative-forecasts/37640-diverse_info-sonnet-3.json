    "review": "Both forecasters raise compelling arguments I hadn't fully incorporated. Forecaster 2 and 3 both identify specific legal and procedural barriers I underweighted: NARA (National Archives) record retention requirements and GSA (General Services Administration) domain decommissioning processes. These aren't just bureaucratic inertia - they're legal obligations that typically require months to complete properly. Forecaster 3's reference to the 2017 precedent where EPA climate pages became redirects/static pages rather than complete removals is particularly relevant. Forecaster 2's explicit consideration of measurement risk (2-3% chance of false 'down' reading due to DNS/CDN issues) is also astute - the resolution mechanism itself introduces some uncertainty. The key insight I'm updating on is that this isn't just about slow government processes, but specific statutory and administrative requirements that make a complete domain takedown in 7 weeks legally and procedurally very difficult, even with strong political will.",
    "rationale": "Updating my analysis based on the specific legal and procedural barriers identified by the other forecasters. The NARA record retention requirements and GSA domain management processes are not discretionary - they're legal obligations that typically span several months. The 2017 precedent strongly suggests that even aggressive political action results in redirects or static pages rather than complete domain removal. My original 87% underweighted these concrete barriers. However, I'm not moving all the way to 95% because: (1) the current administration has shown willingness to move unusually quickly on policy changes, creating some risk of accelerated shutdown; (2) measurement risk via IsItDownRightNow could produce a false negative; (3) there's still a 6-8% chance of intentional high-visibility early decommission as political signaling. The evidence strongly supports the site remaining reachable through July 1, but I maintain slightly more caution than Forecaster 3 about tail risks.",
