    "review": "Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 provide compelling arguments that have caused me to re-evaluate my initial forecast. Forecaster 2 correctly highlights that the administration has already been in office for four months without taking this action, which is strong evidence against it being a high priority. Forecaster 3 introduces an even more powerful argument I had overlooked: the 'specificity hurdle' or 'wording constraint.' Their point that official presidential actions often use different terminology, such as 'diversity immigrant program' rather than the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa', is crucial. This creates a significant possibility that even an action targeting the program would not resolve this question as 'Yes'. I found this line of reasoning particularly persuasive as it adds a new and very plausible failure mode for a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast significantly from 30% to 15%. My initial analysis balanced the President's known opposition to the program against the very short timeline. However, the deliberation has introduced two key factors that strengthen the case for 'No'. First, as pointed out by Forecaster 2, the administration's inaction on this specific issue during its first four months in office suggests it is not a top-level priority compared to other immigration matters like border security. The argument for an 'early flurry of action' is much weaker four months into a term. Second, and more decisively, Forecaster 3's analysis of the 'wording constraint' is a game-changer. The resolution criteria require the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa'. Given that official and legal language may prefer other terms, there is a high likelihood that a relevant presidential action would fail to meet this strict criterion. My updated probability of 15% reflects a new model: P(Action is prioritized in the next 6 weeks) * P(Action uses the exact required wording). Both of these probabilities are low, making the combined probability much lower than my initial estimate.",
