  "information": "Actions preceding the final negotiations included a visit by Vietnamese Defense Minister Gen. Phan Van Giang to South Korea in February 2023. During his visit, he inspected a South Korean army unit operating the K9 and received a briefing from the manufacturer, Hanwha Aerospace. In November 2024, Vietnamese troops also participated in a training program in South Korea for using the K9 howitzer. The two nations had elevated their relationship to a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' in 2022, and South Korea has previously provided military aid to Vietnam, including two decommissioned corvettes.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement announced - the question resolves as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations face delays due to budget approval processes in Vietnam, political sensitivities regarding regional dynamics, or technical/contractual complications. The deal might still be finalized but the announcement comes after the July 1, 2025 deadline, or negotiations stall entirely.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Building on the November 2024 training program and years of relationship development, Vietnam and South Korea finalize the terms and make an official announcement within the next two months. The announcement could occur during a bilateral visit, diplomatic event, or standalone press release from either government.",
    "rationale": "The evidence presents a mixed picture with strong positive indicators but concerning timing issues. On the positive side: Vietnamese troops completed K9 howitzer training as recently as November 2024, which is a strong signal that the deal is in advanced stages - such training typically occurs when procurement is nearly finalized. The Defense Minister's 2023 visit to inspect the K9 system, the elevated 'comprehensive strategic partnership' status since 2022, and previous military cooperation (corvette transfers) all indicate strong bilateral defense ties and momentum.\n\nHowever, several factors create uncertainty: Despite negotiations reportedly ongoing since at least 2023, no announcement has been made yet. We're now in May 2025 with only 2 months until the deadline. Defense procurement deals, especially first-time major arms sales between countries, involve complex negotiations around financing terms, delivery schedules, technology transfer, maintenance agreements, and political approvals from multiple government bodies. These can face unexpected delays even when deals appear close.\n\nThe $300 million price tag for 20 units may require parliamentary or high-level budget approval in Vietnam. Regional sensitivities, particularly regarding China's potential reaction to Vietnam's military modernization and closer defense ties with South Korea, could also introduce delays in making a public announcement.\n\nTwo months is a reasonable timeframe for an announcement if the deal is substantially complete, but not particularly generous given the complexity of defense agreements. The November 2024 training suggests we're past initial negotiations, but the absence of any announcement in the six months since then is somewhat concerning.\n\nMy forecast is not higher (>65%) because years have passed since initial discussions without finalization, and major defense deals often miss expected timelines. It's not lower (<45%) because the November 2024 training is a very recent and concrete indicator of progress, and both countries have clear strategic incentives to complete this historic first arms sale. I would update higher with news of imminent high-level visits, budget approvals, or leaked contract details, and would update lower as each week passes without news or if reports emerge of complications.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Vietnam and South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Korea Herald: [South Korea-Vietnam ties enter new strategic terrain, but need more detailed road map: Seoul envoy](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464718) \"Vietnam is reportedly in negotiations to import 20 units of K9 self-propelled howitzers from Korea in a deal valued at $300 million. If finalized, it would mark Korea’s first defense arms sale to the country.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the governments of Vietnam and/or South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export 2 or more self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam. If no such agreement is announced after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nActions preceding the final negotiations included a visit by Vietnamese Defense Minister Gen.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
