    "review": "The other forecasters and I agree on the fundamental dynamics: the status quo (10.7M shares) supports a 'Yes' outcome, while Berkshire's 10-quarter streak as a net seller of equities supports a 'No' outcome. The key new argument, raised effectively by both other forecasters, is that the Amazon investment was likely made and is managed by Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, not Warren Buffett. I find this reasoning highly convincing. Their investment decisions are likely more independent of Buffett's broad market caution, which drives the overall net-selling trend. This makes it less probable that the Amazon stake would be trimmed as part of a general de-risking strategy and more likely that it would only be sold if their specific, long-term thesis on Amazon changes.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 70% was based on a significant tension between the status quo favoring 'Yes' and the powerful evidence of Berkshire's consistent, company-wide selling pressure favoring 'No'. After reviewing the other analyses, I am persuaded that I underweighted the importance of who manages the Amazon position within Berkshire. As the other forecasters noted, this stake is widely considered a Combs/Weschler pick. Their growth-oriented investment style and independent portfolio management mean the fate of the Amazon holding is not directly tied to Buffett's macro-level decision to build cash reserves. Given Amazon's strong fundamentals (e.g., AWS growth, positive analyst ratings), it is less likely that its dedicated managers would choose to trim over 6.5% of the position. This new consideration materially weakens the primary argument for a 'No' outcome. Consequently, I am increasing my forecast. I am moving to 75%, not higher, because a 10-quarter trend of net selling still reflects a powerful culture of valuation discipline and caution that likely permeates the entire firm, making a trim to raise funds for a different opportunity a non-trivial possibility.",
