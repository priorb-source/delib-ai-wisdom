    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides critical new information - Cassie Piuma is confirmed as a finalist, which I lacked in my initial analysis. However, their 25% forecast seems too anchored on a naive equal-probability assumption among finalists without adequately weighing historical patterns. Forecaster 3 brings the most valuable quantitative insight: a 40% historical base rate over the last decade, significantly higher than my initial 20-30% estimate. They also provide important context about the equity initiative's proven effectiveness (30% to 55% increase in regional categories) while appropriately noting that Outstanding Chef may lag behind. Their 42% forecast appears well-calibrated to the available evidence. The recent two-year trend of male winners (2023, 2024) that Forecaster 3 identified is a modest negative signal I hadn't considered.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast upward based on three key factors: (1) The 40% historical base rate from Forecaster 3 is substantially higher than my initial 20-30% estimate and represents concrete data I should weight heavily. (2) Cassie Piuma's confirmed finalist status means we have at least one viable female candidate, not just speculation about the pool. (3) The equity initiative's demonstrated impact (30% to 55% in regional categories) provides evidence of institutional change, even if Outstanding Chef lags somewhat. However, I'm not moving all the way to 42% because the recent trend of male winners in 2023-2024 suggests some headwinds, and Outstanding Chef as the highest honor may indeed be more conservative in reflecting change. The confirmed female finalist combined with the stronger-than-expected historical base rate justifies moving from 38% to 40%, acknowledging both the real progress and the remaining structural inertia at the top tier.",
