    "review": "Both forecasters made strong analyses that align closely with my own reasoning. Forecaster 2's characterization as a 'coin flip leaning against Florida' is apt given the small sample sizes and high variance. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the 'highly competitive situation' between California and Florida is also well-founded. The key insight I'm taking from their analyses is that with only 8-12 pilot reports nationwide per month, and California and Florida being the clear top two states, the monthly winner could easily vary due to random fluctuation alone. Forecaster 3's 38% forecast gives more weight to this competitive dynamic and Florida's recent March activity, which may be justified. My original 25% forecast may have been too conservative in treating California as dominant when the evidence suggests a more competitive two-horse race. The tie-breaking rule (ties resolve as No) does hurt Florida's chances, but with such small numbers, outright wins should occur frequently enough for either state. The March 2025 incident, while not determinative, suggests Florida remains active. I'm convinced by the argument that in a competitive race with high variance, the slight underdog should have probability closer to 35-40% rather than 25%.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my original forecast underweighted the competitive nature of the California-Florida rivalry in pilot UFO reports. While California maintains a historical volume advantage (36,286 vs 8,623 total sightings), both states are described as the top two for pilot-specific reports. With only 8-12 pilot reports occurring nationwide per month, each state likely receives 1-3 reports in a typical month, creating massive random variation. In this environment, even if California is slightly favored, Florida's probability of finishing first in any given month should be substantial - likely in the 30-40% range rather than 25%. The March 2025 incident demonstrates Florida's recent activity, though two months is sufficient time for patterns to shift. The tie-breaking rule (resolves as No) does work against Florida, preventing me from forecasting as high as Forecaster 3's 38%. However, I'm updating upward to 33% to better reflect the competitive dynamics and the role of random variation in small samples. This positions Florida as a strong but slightly disadvantaged contender rather than a clear underdog.",
