  "information": "Between 2022 and 2024, Volodymyr Zelenskyy participated in three G7 summits: he attended the 2023 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, in person, and attended the 2022 summit in Elmau, Germany, and the 2024 summit in Apulia, Italy, virtually. Throughout the war, he has made numerous international trips, including visits to Washington, Paris, and Davos. On June 2, 2025, he arrived in Vilnius, Lithuania, to attend the Bucharest Nine summit ahead of the NATO summit scheduled for June 24-25 in The Hague.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Roughly 2–4 weeks (the G7 is expected mid-to-late June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Zelenskyy attends in person, consistent with his recent pattern of appearing at top-tier summits when invited and security/logistics allow.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden military crisis or major strike wave in Ukraine forces him to remain in Kyiv, or security/logistics concerns prompt a last-minute switch to virtual participation; alternatively, illness or a scheduling crunch around other June commitments leads to canceling in-person travel.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "With allied airlift/security support, Zelenskyy flies from Europe to Kananaskis, appears at least at one G7 plenary/session, and holds bilaterals with leaders before returning to Europe ahead of the late-June NATO summit.",
    "rationale": "Key considerations:\n- Invitation and incentives: The Canadian host has publicly invited Zelenskyy. G7 leaders routinely spotlight Ukraine; Zelenskyy gains materially from face time for security aid and sanctions coordination. Hosts tend to facilitate his secure travel.\n- Recent behavior/base rate: Since mid-2023 he has increasingly attended top-tier events in person when strategically valuable (e.g., G7, NATO, UN/major bilaterals). While he has occasionally joined virtually, the trend at high-salience summits has been toward in-person presence. This is my status-quo anchor.\n- Logistics and June schedule: The research assistant notes he is already traveling in Europe (Vilnius on June 2 for the Bucharest Nine) with the NATO summit in The Hague on June 24–25. A transatlantic hop to Canada in mid-June and return to Europe is feasible and has precedent. Kananaskis is a highly securable venue, which lowers risk compared to large urban settings.\n- Risks pulling the probability down: Ukraine’s battlefield situation could worsen suddenly, prompting him to stay; Russia could time escalatory strikes during his absence; last‑minute security or aircraft issues; or he could opt for virtual participation to minimize time away. Any health issue or unanticipated domestic political need would also reduce chances.\nWhy not higher: These operational and strategic risks are real and have led to virtual participation before. Why not lower: Clear invitation, strong strategic payoff for in-person diplomacy, manageable logistics, and recent travel activity all support attendance.\nWhat would move me up: Official confirmation from the Ukrainian presidency or Canadian organizers, flight/advance-team indications, or reporting that a Ukraine-focused session/photo-op is planned with Zelenskyy in the room. What would move me down: Reports of a major offensive/crisis in Ukraine, security warnings affecting his travel, or signals from Kyiv that he will address the summit virtually.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Volodymyr Zelenskyy attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCalgary Herald: [Prime Minister Carney invites Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to G7 summit in Kananaskis](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/pm-mark-carney-invites-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-g7-summit-kananaskis)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBetween 2022 and 2024, Volodymyr Zelenskyy participated in three G7 summits: he attended the 2023 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, in person, and attended the 2022 summit in Elmau, Germany, and the 2024 summit in Apulia, Italy, virtually. Throughout the war, he has made numerous international trips, including visits to Washington, Paris, and Davos. On June 2, 2025, he arrived in Vilnius, Lithuania, to attend the Bucharest Nine summit ahead of the NATO summit scheduled for June 24-25 in The Hague.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
