    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (from May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Sri Lanka is not currently shown as 'Available' on the Starlink Availability Map",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Starlink's Sri Lanka rollout faces typical telecommunications deployment delays. Despite receiving regulatory approval in August 2024, the company encounters challenges with ground infrastructure setup, local partnership establishment, payment processing integration, or simply prioritizes other markets. The 6-week remaining window proves insufficient to complete the launch preparations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink has been preparing the Sri Lanka launch throughout the 9 months since licensing approval. All infrastructure, partnerships, and regulatory requirements are nearly complete. The company announces service availability in late May or June 2025, updating their availability map to include Sri Lanka before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The key evidence is that Starlink received a Sri Lankan license in August 2024, approximately 9 months ago. This regulatory approval is typically the most significant hurdle for market entry. However, the question resolves specifically based on the Availability Map status, which requires completed infrastructure and operational readiness, not just licensing. The status quo outcome strongly favors 'No' since Sri Lanka is presumably not currently listed as available - if it were, the question would likely be resolved already. With only 6 weeks remaining, any launch would need to happen very soon. Telecommunications rollouts historically face delays due to infrastructure challenges, local partnership negotiations, and operational setup requirements. While 9 months is a reasonable preparation timeframe, the fact that availability hasn't been announced yet with only 6 weeks left suggests either delays or a launch planned for after the deadline. My forecast is not higher because of the short remaining timeframe and lack of visible progress indicators. It's not lower because Starlink has demonstrated rapid global expansion capabilities, and the regulatory approval does indicate serious market entry intentions. I would update higher with announcements of imminent launch plans or beta testing in Sri Lanka, and lower if June passes without any indication of near-term availability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Sri Lanka as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Musk's Starlink wins Sri Lanka licence](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/sri-lanka-regulator-grants-licence-musks-starlink-satellite-broadband-2024-08-13/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Sri Lanka listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
