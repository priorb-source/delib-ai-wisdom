    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds BoJ’s April regional assessment (“recovering”) and AI/semiconductor-driven strength in machinery/equipment. That’s useful context and aligns with plausible Tohoku exposure via semiconductor equipment makers. However, the Golden Week headwind they cite should be mostly captured by seasonal adjustment, so I discount that. The BoJ’s qualitative tone is supportive but not tightly predictive of a single month’s seasonally adjusted m/m print.\n\nForecaster 3 introduces two important points I hadn’t pinned down: (1) national April IP prelim at -0.9% m/m, which is a meaningful headwind for a regional print; and (2) evidence of modest negative serial correlation after outsized moves, which fits the +7.6% March jump and argues for some payback. Their 55% historical positive-rate base is a helpful anchor, but the combination of national weakness and mean reversion justifies tilting below 50%.\n\nNet: F2’s structural/sector support partly offsets, but F3’s national data and mean-reversion argument are more directly relevant to April’s m/m outcome. I update slightly downward.",
    "rationale": "I previously sat near even odds (46%) with a lean to mean reversion after March’s +7.6%. Incorporating the national April IP preliminary decline (−0.9% m/m) shifts the prior lower for Tohoku, given typical co-movement with national trends. The BoJ’s positive regional tone and plausible AI/semiconductor equipment strength keep me from moving too far down, but I view those as medium-term supports rather than decisive for a single month’s m/m print. Golden Week effects are largely seasonally adjusted, so I give them little weight. Overall, I move modestly lower to reflect national weakness plus expected partial unwind of March’s surge, while acknowledging sectoral tailwinds could still deliver a small positive.",
