    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same key constraints I weighed: extremely tight timeline, lack of any travel/logistics signals, and the strong likelihood any early engagement would be on neutral ground unless there’s a clear, public breakthrough. New useful angles they highlighted: specific early-warning indicators (pool notices, NOTAMs, advance teams, schedule holds) and the way Trump’s “two-week” watch window effectively shifts any plausible justification for travel into mid-to-late June, compressing planning further. I find their reasoning sound. Forecaster 2’s 5% reflects a stricter read of logistics and optics; Forecaster 3’s 9% is close to my prior and captures the small “surprise diplomacy” tail. No new facts were introduced that raise the odds; if anything, the emphasis on logistics signaling and the mid‑June earliest window slightly lowers them.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is roughly a month, with the crucial dependency being tangible progress out of the June 2 Istanbul talks. The White House is not sending an official delegation, suggesting limited near-term engagement. Trump’s late‑May rhetoric (“absolutely crazy,” “very disappointed”) and his stated two‑week observation period point to mid‑June as the earliest moment he’d consider high-touch engagement, leaving perhaps a two-week window for a Moscow trip—very tight for presidential security/logistics. Even with a breakthrough, the modal venue for a first high‑level meeting remains neutral territory or Washington, given domestic and allied optics during an ongoing war. The May 9 speculation did not materialize despite mutual invitations, reinforcing that invites ≠ imminent travel. Tail risk persists because Trump sometimes moves quickly and may seek a headline-grabbing moment if a ceasefire framework emerges, but absent credible signals (public breakthrough, summit chatter tied specifically to Russia, or visible logistics prep), the base case is No. Incorporating the other forecasters’ points nudges me slightly down from 10% to 7%. Upward movers: credible ceasefire framework announced; explicit hints from either capital about a Moscow summit; visible logistics indicators. Downward movers: talks stall; renewed escalation; announcements pointing to a neutral-site or Washington meeting; firm denials.",
