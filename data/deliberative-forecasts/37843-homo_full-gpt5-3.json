    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: status quo plus a short runway argues against a pre–July 1 public trigger, while credible March reporting and bank mandates keep odds nontrivial. New/useful emphasis from them: (1) seasonality around July 4 and preference for fall roadshows; (2) the realistic path that a company blog could announce a confidential draft S‑1 submission, which would satisfy the resolution; (3) the confidential filing option reduces the need for an early public S‑1 if targeting later in 2025. These are solid, and I find them convincing. They slightly push in opposite directions—seasonality nudges down; explicit blog-path possibility nudges up—netting out close to my original view.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~5.5 weeks. That short horizon and no current public filing/blog post make the base case “No.”\n- Resolution mechanics: A Yes requires a public S‑1 on EDGAR or a specific IPO announcement on Discord’s news/blog. Many EGCs (which Discord may be) file confidentially and only go public with their S‑1 closer to the roadshow. That lowers the odds of a public S‑1 by June 30 if aiming for a fall IPO.\n- Countervailing path: It’s common for companies to post a release stating they have confidentially submitted a draft registration statement. If Discord posts such a notice on its news/blog, it would resolve Yes. That path is plausible given credible reporting of 2025 preparations and bank mandates.\n- Market/seasonality: Mixed tape and preference to avoid the July 4 period argue against a June public filing unless they want optionality or signaling. Peers moving toward IPOs supports a modest chance of a June step.\n- Net: The added seasonality argument (down) and the explicit blog‑announcement pathway (up) roughly offset. With no fresh “imminent filing” signals, I keep my estimate essentially unchanged.",
