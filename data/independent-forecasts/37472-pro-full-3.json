  "information": "Sheikh Hasina has been in exile in India since being ousted from power in August 2024. In statements made in February 2025, she vowed to return to Bangladesh, accusing the interim government of unleashing terrorists and promising to seek justice. Legally, she faces multiple challenges. Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has issued her a show-cause notice in a contempt of court case, with a response required by May 15, 2025. Additionally, a separate ICT investigation into alleged crimes against humanity committed during the July 2024 uprising is reportedly in its final stages, with a probe report expected to be submitted within May 2025.\n\nThe political landscape in Bangladesh is currently shaped by an interim government led by Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus. This government has stated its priority is a reform agenda and has indicated that national elections might be delayed until June 2026. On May 6, 2025, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, returned to Bangladesh after receiving four months of medical treatment in London. Following her return, her party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), has increased pressure on the interim government to hold elections sooner, with some leaders demanding polls be held by December 2025.\n\nThe Bangladeshi interim government has publicly stated that securing Sheikh Hasina's extradition from India is a 'top priority.' A formal request for her extradition, along with supporting documents, was submitted to India in December 2024. As of February 2025, India had not officially responded to the request. A spokesperson for Bangladesh's foreign ministry indicated that a formal reminder would be sent to India regarding the extradition at an 'appropriate time' to be determined by the country's political leadership.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months. The resolution window is from May 13, 2025, to June 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo is Sheikh Hasina remaining in exile in India, with the Indian government not acting on the extradition request from Bangladesh.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "India continues to delay or ignore Bangladesh's extradition request, prioritizing its long-term strategic interests and relationship with the Awami League. Facing serious charges including crimes against humanity, Sheikh Hasina concludes that a voluntary return is too personally and politically risky, and she remains in India past the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either India decides that extraditing Sheikh Hasina is a necessary concession to stabilize its relationship with the new Bangladeshi government and acts with uncharacteristic speed, or Sheikh Hasina, seeing her rival Khaleda Zia's return and facing imminent formal charges, makes a high-risk decision to return voluntarily to rally her supporters and confront the interim government.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant inertia and political complexity surrounding Sheikh Hasina's situation, which makes a return within the short timeframe of under two months highly unlikely. The status quo, where she remains in exile in India, is the most powerful factor. Extradition of a former head of state is a slow, politically sensitive process. India's lack of response to the extradition request submitted in December 2024 strongly suggests they are not treating this with urgency and are likely weighing the geopolitical ramifications. It is more probable that India will delay a decision indefinitely than act within the next seven weeks. A voluntary return is also improbable, despite her vows. Such statements are common for exiled leaders seeking to maintain political relevance. Returning would mean facing near-certain arrest and prosecution on severe charges, including crimes against humanity, by a hostile interim government. This is a risk few would rationally take. The return of her rival, Khaleda Zia, likely increases the political pressure, but it also solidifies the power of the anti-Hasina forces, making a return even more dangerous for her.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because unexpected political events can occur. India could make a sudden strategic calculation to extradite her to secure goodwill with the new regime, or Sheikh Hasina could make a desperate, high-stakes gamble to return, believing it's her only chance to reshape the political narrative. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the barriers to her return are immense. The legal and diplomatic timeline for extradition is typically much longer than seven weeks, and the personal risks associated with a voluntary return are extreme. The default outcome is for the current situation to persist.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of India agreeing to the extradition, or if Sheikh Hasina herself announced concrete plans and travel arrangements. I would decrease my forecast as the June 30 deadline approaches with no change in the status quo.",
