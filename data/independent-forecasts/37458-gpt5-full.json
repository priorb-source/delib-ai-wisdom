  "information": "The last mutually acknowledged phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping took place on January 17, 2025. Since then, Trump has claimed to have spoken with Xi on multiple occasions, but China's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly and publicly denied that any leader-to-leader calls have occurred. On May 5, 2025, President Trump stated he had 'no immediate plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping.' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakum reiterated that 'the two heads of state have not called each other recently' and that no negotiations on tariffs are underway.\n\nThe US and China are engaged in an ongoing trade war. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on most Chinese imports, and China has retaliated with tariffs of up to 125% on US goods. On May 6, 2025, Trump stated that Chinese officials want to negotiate, but on the same day, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Congress that no official negotiations have begun between the two countries. High-level trade talks between Treasury Secretary Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are scheduled to take place in Geneva on May 10-11, 2025.\n\nIn March 2025, news outlets including The Wall Street Journal reported that the US and China were in the early stages of discussing a potential 'birthday summit' for June, as Trump's birthday is on June 14 and Xi's is on June 15. The status of these discussions is uncertain. In early May 2025, Chinese President Xi Jinping is on a state visit to Russia from May 7 to 10 to meet with President Vladimir Putin and attend Victory Day celebrations. Topics for their discussion include strategic relations and the US tariff war.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Working-level talks in Geneva (May 10–11) fail to produce momentum; rhetoric hardens; Beijing keeps denying any leader-level contact and avoids acknowledging any claimed call. Trump may assert contact, but without Chinese confirmation the criterion is not met.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Geneva talks yield a modest breakthrough or framework; both sides decide to stabilize optics by scheduling a leaders’ call in late May or early June. Readouts are issued by both Washington and Beijing (possibly in the context of arranging or previewing a mid-June “birthday” meeting), satisfying the mutual-acknowledgment requirement.",
    "rationale": "- Status and timing: The window is narrow (May 12–June 15). The last mutually acknowledged Trump–Xi call was Jan 17, 2025. Since then, Trump has periodically claimed calls; China has explicitly denied any leader-to-leader calls. On May 5, Trump said he had no immediate plans to speak with Xi; China stated the heads of state have not called recently. That pattern points to “No” as the status quo absent a catalyst.\n- Negotiating context: Tariffs are elevated (US up to 145%, China up to 125%). High-level working talks (Bessent–He Lifeng) on May 10–11 could create a natural trigger for a leaders’ call the following week if progress is made or a framework is set. Historically, leader calls often follow such meetings to endorse direction or manage escalation.\n- Summit chatter: Early-stage reporting about a possible mid-June “birthday summit” increases the chance of a pre-summit phone call, as leaders often speak to greenlight logistics or signal intent. However, the summit’s status is uncertain, and Beijing has recently been cautious about acknowledging calls amid tariff brinkmanship.\n- Acknowledgment hurdle: The resolution requires both sides to acknowledge the call. Given recent denials from China, this lowers the odds compared to a world where a unilateral US claim would suffice. When China does participate in a real leader call, it typically issues its own readout, but they may avoid calls they don’t want to acknowledge.\nWhy not higher? Ongoing public denials, no immediate plans as of May 5, and a very specific, short window constrain odds. The mutual-acknowledgment requirement further reduces the chance.\nWhy not lower? Active talks are imminent, and both sides have incentives to manage escalation. A leader call is a relatively low-cost tool, and the rumored June timing provides a focal point.\nWhat would move me up: A positive, joint signal from the May 10–11 talks; credible reports of a planned June meeting; language from either side that “the leaders agreed to maintain close communication.” What would move me down: Breakdown or acrimonious readouts from Geneva; new tariff salvos; continued explicit denials paired with statements that leader-level contact is not planned.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs. China has denied talks are taking place](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-xi-china-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe last mutually acknowledged phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping took place on January 17, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
