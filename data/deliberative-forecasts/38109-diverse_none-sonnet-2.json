    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I completely overlooked: we need to verify whether Kalshi CURRENTLY offers MLB game markets at all. Forecaster 2 assumes the status quo includes existing daily baseball markets, which drives their 70% forecast. But Forecaster 3 notes there's no clear evidence these markets exist, and historically the CFTC has been very restrictive about sports betting on regulated exchanges. This creates two vastly different scenarios: (1) If markets already exist, continuation is likely (supporting Forecaster 2's view), or (2) If markets don't exist, launching them in June 2025 would require rapid regulatory approval that seems highly improbable given CFTC's historical stance. The legal case mentioned in the background is about election markets, not sports, which doesn't provide a clear path for sports markets. Forecaster 3's observation about the 'all days' requirement being strict is also valid but becomes secondary if markets likely won't exist at all. The resolution criteria link to Kalshi's baseball category suggests something exists or is anticipated, but this isn't definitive proof of current market offerings.",
    "rationale": "I'm significantly lowering my forecast based on Forecaster 3's regulatory analysis. The core issue is whether Kalshi currently offers these markets. If they don't, the probability of getting CFTC approval and launching within June 2025 is extremely low given historical regulatory reluctance toward sports betting on federally regulated exchanges. The legal case about 'moving quickly' pertains to election markets, not sports, so it doesn't clearly enable sports game contracts. However, I'm not going as low as 5% because: (1) the question's existence and the Kalshi link suggest some baseline plausibility, (2) there's uncertainty about current market status that I cannot definitively resolve, and (3) small possibility of existing markets or novel compliance framework. The combination of regulatory barriers, operational stringency (every single day requirement), and potential MLB off-days creates substantial downside risk.",
