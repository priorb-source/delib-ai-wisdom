    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~5.5 weeks (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the HTS does not currently contain a country-wide +17% duty on Israeli-origin goods; Israel’s FTA rates (often Free under “IL” in the Special column) remain in place.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US takes no new action targeting Israeli goods. The US–Israel FTA stays in force, and no Chapter 99 subheading (or other HTS entry) is added specifying an additional +17% duty on products of Israel. On June 1, the HTS shows standard IL rates (generally Free) and no Israel-specific +17% line, so the check resolves No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before June 1, USTR/USITC publishes an HTS update creating an Israel-specific Chapter 99 provision imposing an additional ad valorem duty of 17% on products of Israel (possibly framed as a “reciprocity” tariff pegged to Israel’s 17% VAT or as a sanction/retaliation). Even if listed as suspended, the presence of “+ 17%” for Israel in the applicable HTS subheading would trigger a Yes resolution.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: Israel has a long-standing FTA with the US; IL special rates in the HTS are typically duty-free. There is no existing country-wide +17% duty on Israel in the HTS.\n- Policy pathways: Country-specific across-the-board tariffs in HTS usually come via Chapter 99 actions under Section 301, 232, 201, or IEEPA sanctions. There is no active, public process aimed at imposing a 17% duty on Israel. Section 301 actions use standard rates (10%, 25%, etc.) tied to specific investigations; 17% is unusual. A VAT-reciprocity tariff concept (which would make Israel’s rate 17%) has been floated in political rhetoric, but it is not an active Biden administration policy and would likely be broad-based, not Israel-only, and would require clear executive action and HTS updates — none evident.\n- Politics and timing: Imposing a new tariff regime specifically on Israel before June 1, 2025 would be politically atypical and operationally tight. With ~5.5 weeks left, we would expect clear signals (Federal Register notices, USTR announcements, draft HTS amendments); there are none. \n- Resolution nuance: The question counts even if the provision is “suspended,” which slightly increases the tail risk. Still, creating any Israel-specific +17% HTS subheading swiftly, without prior public process, is unlikely.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information available; I therefore rely on current public policy baselines and institutional process norms.\n- Why not higher: No concrete policy moves, atypical rate choice (17%), strong political and legal frictions, and very short timeline.\n- Why not lower: Small tail risk of a sudden political action leading to a posted (even suspended) Chapter 99 line, or a rare HTS clerical anomaly.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports or official notices of a new reciprocity tariff policy, a Section 301/232/IEEPA action targeting Israel with a specified 17% rate, or draft HTS amendments showing a 17% additional duty on Israel. \n- What would move me down: Continued absence of any such signals by mid-May; explicit administration statements ruling out new tariffs; HTS mid-cycle updates that do not include any Israel-focused provisions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Israel as 17% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of Israel: [Israeli exports to US will take annual $2.3B hit under tariffs, industrial org warns](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-exports-to-us-will-take-2-3-billion-hit-under-tariffs-industrialist-org-warns/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 17% for Israel at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=israel) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
