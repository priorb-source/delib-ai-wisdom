    "review": "Both forecasters lean on the same core pillars I used: low base rate over short windows, recency of the Feb 2024 reshuffle, and the committee’s preference for structural over reactive changes. I found Forecaster 3’s explicit mention of potential strategic adds (Alphabet/Meta) useful as a plausible tail, while Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the very short time window (mid‑single‑digit unconditional odds) sharpened the base‑rate framing. Neither added a concrete, near‑term catalyst I had missed (e.g., a known split, merger, or committee signaling), and both reinforced that short‑term volatility isn’t sufficient. Overall, their reasoning is consistent and supports a low single‑digit to high single‑digit probability range; I don’t see a compelling reason to move materially from my prior estimate.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~66 days until July 1, 2025. Status quo outcome: No change, as DJIA revisions are infrequent and usually tied to structural representation or corporate actions, not transient volatility. No scenario: No major constituent corporate actions, no extreme price collapse to negligible weight, no committee push for representational changes—typical case over a two‑month horizon. Yes scenario: An unexpected, material corporate event (spin‑off/merger rendering a name less appropriate), a forced reputational/operational crisis (e.g., compounding issues at a constituent), a large stock split by a high‑priced member prompting rebalancing, or a representational add (e.g., Alphabet/Meta) that displaces a weaker incumbent (e.g., Verizon/IBM/3M/Disney).\n\nBase rate: Changes in 2015, 2018, 2020, 2024 imply ~1 event every 2–3 years. A ~2‑month window implies an unconditional probability around the mid‑single digits. The Feb 2024 update reduces near‑term odds of another adjustment absent a catalyst. Offsetting that slightly are plausible but unproven tails (desire to include another mega‑cap platform company or an unforeseen corporate action). With no credible reports, known splits, or forced events on deck, I keep a low but non‑trivial probability.\n\nUpdate: Forecasters 2 and 3 reinforced the base-rate and catalyst framework I already used. Their arguments don’t introduce new concrete triggers before July 1, so I maintain my prior estimate rather than adjust. I’d move up on credible reporting of an imminent DJIA change, a constituent merger/spin-off, or a high‑profile split; I’d move down if we reach mid‑June with continued quiet.",
