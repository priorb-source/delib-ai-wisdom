    "review": "Both forecasters added useful detail I hadn’t fully incorporated: (1) the likely small current gap after a recent skid (Forecaster 2’s mention of an Angels sweep suggests LA is only a game or two off the top), (2) the correct horizon of roughly 22–27 games to June 15 (I had implicitly used a shorter slate), and (3) explicit treatment that ties for best winning percentage should count as Yes. Forecaster 3 also sharpened the “single‑day snapshot” point and laid out rotation uncertainties alongside a plausible Kershaw return window. I find their logic generally sound. The tie-counting point and the longer remaining slate both slightly improve LA’s chances relative to my prior. I’m less convinced by singling out specific rivals like the Tigers/Mets without standings in hand, but the broader “crowded top tier” framing is correct and argues against a very high probability for any single team.",
    "rationale": "I’m nudging my estimate up because: (a) ties count, which meaningfully helps on an exact-date question; (b) I understated the number of remaining games, which gives a strong team like LA more runway to erase a small deficit; and (c) the reported gap to first is probably modest (on the order of 1–2 games). Counterbalancing that, the field is strong and likely includes 3–5 teams playing at a .600+ clip, so any one team’s share to be on top on a specific date remains well below 50%. Heuristically: if there are ~4–5 comparable contenders, the base per-team share is ~20–25%. Give LA a few points for elite true talent and the “ties count” edge, but take some back for not currently leading and the exact-day variance. Net, I move from 24% to 29% (+5pp). I would move higher if we saw LA within a half-game of the top (or tied) by late May or if a key rival faltered; I’d move lower if LA’s gap grows to >2–3 games or if another club sustains a >.650 pace into early June.",
