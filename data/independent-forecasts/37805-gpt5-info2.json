  "information": "The weakness of the Japanese yen poses a challenge to tourism in the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI), as Japanese travelers tend to prefer non-U.S. dollar destinations. Japanese visitor numbers to the CNMI were 7,762 in 2023 and 13,779 in 2024, with the increase largely due to cruise ship arrivals. In response, United Airlines has launched a digital advertising campaign for its Narita-Saipan route, and the Marianas Visitors Authority has partnered with Japanese travel agencies. The islands also received diving awards at the 'Marine Diving Fair 2025' in Tokyo, highlighting their appeal. Separately, Hong Kong Airlines lists Saipan as one of its destinations, and travel platform Expedia noted a significant increase in search volume for Saipan from Hong Kong travelers.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (from 2025-05-20 to 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No: 4 or fewer direct destinations listed for SPN on FlightsFrom.com",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By early July, FlightsFrom lists only Guam (GUM), Seoul Incheon (ICN), Tokyo Narita (NRT), and at most one additional city (or none), with routes like Hong Kong (HKG) and Busan (PUS) absent or only operating as unscheduled charters not captured in the database.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "FlightsFrom lists at least five scheduled nonstop destinations, e.g., GUM + ICN + NRT + HKG + PUS (or another Korean/Japanese city such as Muan, Daegu, Osaka, or Nagoya) appearing in the 12‑month schedule window when checked on/after July 1.",
    "rationale": "- What we know and how it bears on the base rate: Saipan’s scheduled international network has been thin since the pandemic, with reliable service to Guam and Korea, and a more tentative recovery to Japan. The research assistant notes: (1) the weak yen is suppressing Japan demand; (2) United is actively promoting NRT–SPN; (3) Hong Kong Airlines lists Saipan as a destination and Expedia reports elevated HKG search interest. These suggest a core of GUM, ICN, and likely NRT, with HKG and one additional Korea city (e.g., Busan) as the key swing destinations.\n- FlightsFrom methodology matters: the site lists all scheduled nonstop destinations in the next 12 months from the check date. This means routes set to operate later in 2025 could still count if they’re loaded in the schedule by July 1. That nudges odds upward relative to requiring service specifically on July 1.\n- Status quo weighting: The most stable configuration is 3–4 destinations (GUM, ICN, NRT, and sometimes PUS). Achieving >4 requires both HKG and a second Korea/Japan city to be scheduled. Given continued demand headwinds from Japan (weak yen) and lingering uncertainty about broader China/Hong Kong-origin travel and visa frictions, it’s not obvious both will be in the schedules.\n- Why not higher: Evidence for HKG–SPN is suggestive (carrier lists destination; search interest) but not conclusive that sustained, scheduled service is loaded in GDS/OAG. Similarly, Korean secondary-city routes (PUS, TAE, MWX) have been volatile and often seasonal/charter; if not filed as scheduled, they won’t appear on FlightsFrom.\n- Why not lower: United’s NRT–SPN promotion implies that route is live into the summer/fall. Korea demand has been the CNMI mainstay, keeping ICN service robust and making at least one secondary Korea city plausible. The 12‑month listing window also allows late‑2025 scheduled flights to count if they’re already filed by early July.\n- What would move my forecast up: Verified schedule filings (GDS/OAG) for HKG–SPN and any second Korean or Japanese city (e.g., PUS, KIX, NGO) visible on FlightsFrom or via airline timetables before July 1. Any government/airline announcements confirming resumed scheduled service (not ad-hoc charters) for late 2025.\n- What would move it down: Signs that UA’s NRT–SPN is suspended after spring/early summer, or that Korean LCCs cut back to only ICN (no PUS/secondary cities), and lack of concrete HKG schedule entries beyond marketing mentions.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
