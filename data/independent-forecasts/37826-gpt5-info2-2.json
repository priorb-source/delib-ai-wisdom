  "information": "After India's initial strikes, a period of military escalation occurred. The Indian Army reported that on the night of May 8-9, 2025, Pakistan launched multiple attacks using drones and missiles targeting military stations at Jammu, Pathankot, and Udhampur, and committed numerous ceasefire violations along the Line of Control. India stated that these threats were neutralized using kinetic and non-kinetic means with no casualties or material losses reported on the Indian side. India conducted retaliatory strikes, with reports claiming the destruction of a Pakistani post, a terrorist launch pad, and 11 Pakistani airbases. After several days of tension, a ceasefire was agreed upon on May 10, 2025, following direct talks between the two countries' Directors-General of Military Operations (DGMOs). Subsequently, Pakistani intelligence sources reported an agreement for both sides to withdraw troops to their pre-conflict positions by the end of May.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No kinetic Indian attack in Pakistan proper during June; the post–May 10 ceasefire holds and any friction remains confined to the LoC in Pakistan-administered Kashmir (which wouldn’t count).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Both sides stick to the May 10 ceasefire and withdrawals by end-May. June sees only sporadic incidents on the LoC/AJK side or inside Indian territory, with India choosing non-kinetic responses or limited actions confined to PoK. No Indian fire, air, missile, or drone strikes land in Pakistan’s provinces (Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A mass-casualty attack in India or a significant Pakistani drone/missile strike in June prompts a punitive Indian response into Pakistan proper—e.g., an IAF precision strike on a Khyber Pakhtunkhwa camp (as in Balakot 2019), or artillery/missile/drone fire across the international border that hits targets in Pakistan’s Punjab or Sindh sectors.",
    "rationale": "- Definitions matter: The question resolves Yes only if Indian forces conduct a kinetic action inside Pakistan’s provinces (Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). Strikes in Pakistan-administered Kashmir (AJK/Gilgit-Baltistan) do not count. Most routine skirmishing occurs on the LoC (AJK), so the base pathway to a Yes is narrower than generic “India–Pakistan escalation.”\n\n- Recent situation (assistant’s report): After early May exchanges—including Pakistani drone/missile attacks on Jammu/Pathankot/Udhampur and Indian retaliatory claims—both sides agreed to a ceasefire on May 10 via DGMO talks, with reported plans to withdraw to pre-conflict positions by end-May. That signals de-escalation momentum.\n\n- Base rate and incentives: Kinetic Indian attacks in Pakistan proper are rare; the notable modern precedent is the 2019 Balakot airstrike in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa after a mass-casualty terror attack. India typically prefers responses on the LoC/PoK to manage escalation risks. Crossing into Pakistan’s provinces—especially by air or missiles—raises nuclear and diplomatic risks, which Delhi and Islamabad both have strong incentives to avoid absent a major provocation. International actors (US, Gulf states, China) usually press for restraint.\n\n- Why not higher: A formal ceasefire and announced drawdowns lower the hazard. Delhi lacks a near-term electoral incentive to escalate, and it retains less escalatory options (LoC-focused operations, non-kinetic measures). The one-month window is short; without a triggering event, the probability of a deliberate strike in Pakistan proper remains low.\n\n- Why not lower: Tensions remain elevated after early May. A single high-profile provocation—e.g., a mass-casualty attack inside India credibly traced to Pakistan-based groups, or significant Pakistani kinetic action deep in India—could prompt a Balakot-style strike into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or limited fires across the international border into Pakistan’s Punjab. Even limited cross-border artillery/drone fire that lands in those provinces would satisfy the criterion.\n\n- What would move me up: (1) A major terror attack in India with attribution to Pakistan-based militants; (2) renewed Pakistani drone/missile strikes hitting Indian targets in June; (3) visible Indian force posture changes (IAF forward deployments, NOTAMs, publicized cabinet committee on security meetings, hawkish official signaling about cross-border punitive action); (4) breakdown of the ceasefire with artillery exchanges along the international border sectors (Punjab/Sindh), not just the LoC.\n\n- What would move me down: (1) Verified completion of mutual withdrawals and continued quiet through late May; (2) DGMO or diplomatic readouts reaffirming the ceasefire; (3) active third-party mediation headlines emphasizing sustained de-escalation; (4) lack of major militant incidents in India through mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack in Pakistan proper in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 India–Pakistan conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_conflict)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack on targets in one of the following provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nTo count, an attack must be [kinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_military_action), using explosive weaponry or physical violence. Non-kinetic actions such as a cyberattack would not count, even one resulting in deaths.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAfter India's initial strikes, a period of military escalation occurred.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
