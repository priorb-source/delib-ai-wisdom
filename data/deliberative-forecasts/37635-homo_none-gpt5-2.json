    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: small current edge for Milei, limited time for big moves, and Morning Consult’s stickiness. They add two useful emphasis points: (1) the tie-as-No plus integer rounding/display elevates tie risk; (2) the exact “checked on or after June 28” snapshot timing adds extra noise. They also underscore Sheinbaum’s early-term stickiness (AMLO precedent) and enumerate plausible Milei downside shocks (protests/currency wobble). I find these points credible and slightly underweighted in my initial take. None of their arguments flip the direction (still a narrow Yes), but they justify shaving the edge down a bit.",
    "rationale": "About 45 days remain and the displayed gap is only 1 point (61 vs 60). Morning Consult leader approvals tend to be stable with modest weekly movement, which modestly favors the status quo (Milei ahead). Countervailing factors: ties resolve No; integer rounding can turn a slim underlying lead into a displayed tie; and the specific weekly snapshot when Metaculus checks introduces timing noise. Fundamentals suggest Sheinbaum’s approval is likely to remain near ~60 in an early-term phase, while Milei’s path includes both supportive narratives (disinflation, fiscal consolidation, possible legislative progress) and risks (recession bite, protest/market stress). Netting these, I still see a slight edge for Milei to be displayed higher on/after June 28, but the tie/rounding/timing considerations nudge me a bit closer to even. I’m trimming my prior 56% to 54% to reflect those added risks while retaining a narrow Yes tilt from the current lead and typical inertia.",
