    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months until the 2025 Canadian federal election scheduled for October 20, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Bloc Québécois wins more seats than the Conservatives in Quebec, as they have in most recent elections (2021: Bloc 32 vs Conservative 10; 2019: Bloc 32 vs Conservative 10)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party experiences an unprecedented surge in Quebec, gaining substantial support beyond their traditional suburban Montreal strongholds and expanding into francophone regions, while the Bloc Québécois simultaneously collapses, allowing Conservatives to win equal or more seats",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Bloc Québécois maintains its traditional strength among Quebec nationalists and sovereigntists, continuing to dominate francophone regions including Quebec City and rural Quebec, while Conservatives remain limited to their historical support base in certain suburban areas",
    "rationale": "The historical pattern strongly favors the Bloc winning more seats than the Conservatives in Quebec. In the past several elections, the Bloc has consistently outperformed the Conservatives in Quebec seat count by significant margins (32 vs 10 in both 2021 and 2019). The Conservatives typically struggle in francophone Quebec and are limited to specific suburban Montreal regions. The provided articles indicate mixed signals: one discusses Carney's Liberal surge potentially hurting the Bloc, but this would primarily benefit Liberals rather than Conservatives. The other article explicitly states that in Quebec City, a Conservative candidate cannot run and the Bloc is benefitting, which reinforces Conservative weakness rather than strength. For the Conservatives to overtake the Bloc would require an extraordinary and historically unprecedented shift in Quebec politics. The Bloc's core support among Quebec nationalists remains distinct from Conservative appeal. The status quo strongly suggests continuation of Bloc dominance over Conservatives. My forecast is not higher (approaching 95%+) because elections can produce surprises, and a major political realignment could theoretically occur. It's not lower because there is no evidence of a Conservative surge in Quebec, and historical patterns are remarkably consistent.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Bloc Québécois win more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Carney’s Surge in Quebec Could Wipe the Sovereigntist Party Off the Map](https://thewalrus.ca/carneys-surge-in-quebec-could-wipe-the-sovereigntist-party-off-the-map/) | [In Quebec City, a Conservative candidate cannot run and the Bloc is benefitting](https://nationalpost.com/news/in-quebec-city-a-conservative-candidate-cannot-run-and-the-bloc-is-benefitting)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Bloc Québécois party wins more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party of Canada in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election). If it wins the same or fewer seats, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
