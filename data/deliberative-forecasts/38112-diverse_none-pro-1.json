    "review": "The other forecasters provided compelling arguments for a more pessimistic outlook. I found two points particularly convincing. First, as both highlighted, the creation of the partner framework at the 16th Summit was likely a deliberate move to slow down and structure expansion, absorbing geopolitical pressure without immediately diluting the core group. It serves as an alternative to, rather than an immediate funnel for, full membership. Second, Forecaster 3's point that several countries invited to be partners in 2024 have not yet even confirmed their participation is a crucial piece of evidence I had overlooked. It would be institutionally awkward and premature for BRICS to invite new full members while the status of the new partner tier remains unsettled. These arguments strongly suggest that the bloc's current priority is consolidation and operationalizing the new partner framework, not further full-member expansion.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 40% to 30%. My initial forecast placed significant weight on the recent momentum from the 2023 expansion and Indonesia's upgrade in early 2025. However, the other forecasters have convinced me that I misinterpreted the signals from the most recent summit. The creation of the partner framework in October 2024 is the most recent and relevant policy signal, and it points toward a period of managed, two-tiered engagement rather than continued rapid growth of full members. The fact that the partner framework itself is not yet fully solidified, with some invitees yet to confirm, makes it highly improbable that the bloc would move to elevate a partner or invite an entirely new country to full membership at this upcoming summit. The arguments for a 'No' outcome—the need for consolidation, the high bar of unanimity, and the host's likely preference for a low-key summit—are significantly strengthened by these new considerations. While the geopolitical desire for expansion from members like China and Russia still exists, the institutional logic for pausing is now much clearer. I am therefore aligning my forecast with the more cautious stance of the other analysts.",
