    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, with the resolution date being July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Mahmoud Khalil remains in the United States while his legal challenges against his detention and potential deportation proceed through the court system.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Khalil's legal challenges continue through the court system past the July 1, 2025 deadline. His lawyers may successfully argue for a stay of removal, or the court's calendar may simply not allow for a final resolution and exhaustion of all immediate appeals within this short timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A federal court rules decisively against Khalil, dismissing his case and denying any request for a stay of removal. Following the court's decision, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) expedites his case and executes the physical deportation before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the typically slow pace of the United States' legal and immigration systems. The deadline of July 1, 2025, is less than seven weeks away. It is highly improbable for a contested deportation case, which the background states is actively 'mov[ing] forward,' to proceed from a hearing to a final judicial resolution and subsequent administrative enforcement within such a contracted period. The status quo, in which an individual is challenging their removal, heavily favors extended timelines that stretch for many months or even years. Therefore, the status quo outcome is a 'No.'\n\nMy probability is not lower than 10% because a swift resolution, while unlikely, is not impossible. A judge could issue a summary judgment denying his petition, and ICE could prioritize his removal. The system is capable of moving quickly, even if it rarely does.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 10% because the path to a 'Yes' outcome requires multiple independent events to occur in rapid succession: a quick and unfavorable court ruling, the denial of any stays, and swift administrative action by ICE. The inertia and procedural safeguards built into the legal system create significant friction, making such a rapid sequence of events a low-probability scenario.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon news of a court ruling against Khalil that explicitly denies a stay of removal. I would decrease my forecast if a court scheduled hearings for after July 1, 2025, or formally granted a stay of removal for an extended period.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mahmoud Khalil be deported before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mahmoud Khalil's challenge to his detention moves forward]()\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the United States deports Mahmoud Khalil before July 1, 2025. For purposes of this question, \"deported\" means Khalil being transported out of the territory of the United States against his will.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
