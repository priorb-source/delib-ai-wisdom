    "review": "All three forecasters have converged remarkably on the same probability range (5-6%), applying nearly identical reasoning. This strong consensus validates the analytical approach. Key points of agreement: (1) the base rate calculation of 4-6 reports over 10 years translates to approximately 3-5% monthly probability, (2) the January Rwanda report is likely statistical noise rather than indicating a trend, (3) pilot reports are inherently rare events (1% of total UFO reports), and (4) the status quo of rarity should dominate forecasts. Forecaster 3's slightly higher 6% forecast weights the recent Rwanda report somewhat more heavily, while Forecaster 2 and I both settled on 5%. No forecaster introduced new empirical evidence beyond the research assistant's report. Forecaster 3's explicit discussion of update conditions (what would change the forecast) is useful framework but doesn't alter the current probability assessment. The convergence itself provides some validation - we're all working from the same historical data and reaching essentially identical conclusions through independent analysis.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I find no compelling reason to update my forecast. The deliberation confirmed my original reasoning rather than challenging it. All forecasters correctly identified the monthly base rate of approximately 3-5% derived from historical data, acknowledged that pilot reports are rare events, and appropriately weighted the status quo. The January 2025 Rwanda report demonstrates these events occasionally occur but doesn't establish a trend that would justify forecasting above the historical base rate. Forecaster 3's 6% represents a minimal difference from my 5% that falls within reasonable uncertainty bounds, but I see no evidence to justify even this small adjustment upward. The case for 5% remains strong: it respects the empirical base rate, accounts for the demonstrable non-zero probability, avoids overconfidence in either direction, and appropriately weights the status quo in the absence of systematic changes. I would reconsider if we saw multiple African pilot reports emerge in late May, but absent such evidence, the historical pattern should dominate.",
