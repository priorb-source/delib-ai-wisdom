  "information": "When asked about her potential 2026 gubernatorial candidacy, Casey DeSantis has consistently responded with noncommittal phrases such as, \"We'll see.\" As of early June 2025, there have been no public reports of official campaign staff hires, fundraising filings with the Florida Division of Elections, or other formal preparations for a campaign launch. Polling from early 2025 indicated a high favorability rating for her among registered Republicans, with one poll showing her at 57% compared to Byron Donalds' 27%. However, a separate internal poll conducted by the Donalds campaign showed him with a narrow lead over DeSantis, 34% to 30%.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Casey DeSantis has not announced her candidacy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis continues responding with 'We'll see' to questions about running, delays her decision into later 2025 or early 2026, or decides not to pursue the race given Trump's endorsement of Byron Donalds and the competitive landscape.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis accelerates her timeline and makes a formal announcement in the next 3-4 weeks, possibly seeking to establish frontrunner status early or to counter Byron Donalds' momentum before the traditional campaign season begins.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. With only 26 days remaining, there are no visible signs of imminent campaign launch: no reported staff hires, no fundraising filings with Florida's Division of Elections, and consistently noncommittal public statements. Major political campaigns typically require weeks of preparation, infrastructure building, and strategic planning before formal announcements. The 2026 gubernatorial election is approximately 17 months away, which falls within the typical announcement window (12-18 months out), but candidates rarely announce without laying groundwork first. Trump's endorsement of Byron Donalds complicates her calculus, as running against a Trump-backed candidate in Florida Republican politics carries significant risk. The polling data shows mixed signals - she had strong favorability (57%) in one poll but trailed Donalds in his campaign's internal polling. My forecast isn't lower because she does have high name recognition, strong favorability among Republicans, and theoretically could announce quickly if motivated. However, it's not higher because the complete absence of campaign preparation, the short 26-day window, and political headwinds make an imminent announcement unlikely. To update higher, I'd need to see: filing of campaign paperwork, hiring of key staff, donors signaling commitments, or more definitive statements. To update lower, I'd need her to rule out running or the time window to shrink further without any movement.",
