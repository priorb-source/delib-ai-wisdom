    "review": "Forecaster 2 largely echoes my initial view: capable host with visible political support versus the institutional tendency to align host awards with formal meetings. Forecaster 3 adds a new, specific argument: ITKF host selections typically happen 24–36 months in advance, implying we’re late relative to precedent for a 2026 event. They also stress the lack of any ITKF-channel signals (agenda, shortlist, meeting) and the requirement for an explicit ITKF announcement, not just Egyptian media. I find the timing-precedent point directionally persuasive, though I’m not fully confident in the exact 24–36 month figure without corroboration. Still, combined with the current silence on ITKF platforms and the short runway, it tilts me downward. The countervailing point that smaller federations can act ad hoc keeps the probability from dropping too far, especially given Egypt’s capacity and apparent interest.",
    "rationale": "Time left is about seven weeks. The decisive factor is an official ITKF announcement before July 1. Positive indicators: minister-level engagement with the ITKF president; Egypt’s strong record hosting major events; plausible financing and execution capacity; and the possibility that the ITKF could approve via an executive mechanism without waiting for a large congress. Negative indicators: no visible ITKF process signals (e.g., scheduled decision meeting, shortlist, MoU) yet; federations often time host awards to congresses; and, per Forecaster 3’s point, typical lead times suggest this is already late for a 2026 award, increasing the chance of slippage past July 1 even if Egypt is favored. Given these, I’m nudging down my forecast. Change: from 38% to 30%, reflecting added weight on historical timing and current silence on ITKF channels while still acknowledging the real possibility of a late, expedited decision.",
