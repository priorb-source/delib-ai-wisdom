  "information": "China's Consumer Price Index (CPI) has registered three consecutive months of year-on-year deflation: -0.7% in February, -0.1% in March, and -0.1% in April 2025. The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of factory-gate prices, has also shown sustained deflationary pressure, declining for 31 consecutive months. In April, the PPI fell by 2.7% year-on-year, the largest decline in six months. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, has remained positive but low, at around +0.5% year-on-year.\n\nChina's manufacturing activity contracted for the second consecutive month in May, with the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) standing at 49.5, below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. The non-manufacturing PMI also showed a slight decline to 50.3 in May from 50.4 in the previous month. In the property sector, new-home sales from the 100 largest developers fell by 8.6% year-on-year in May, following an 8.7% drop in April.\n\nSpecific components influencing China's inflation data include energy and food prices. Brent crude oil averaged $84 in May 2025, a 4% increase from a year earlier. However, the year-on-year change in domestic energy prices remained negative. Pork prices, a key component of the food basket, also remained lower than a year ago due to high inventories. On the policy front, the People's Bank of China implemented a 10 basis point reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut in mid-May.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1–2 weeks (NBS May CPI likely around June 10–12; FRED updates shortly after).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — another slightly negative YoY CPI print for May.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Holiday-related services firmness and a less negative food/energy contribution lift headline CPI to 0.0–0.2% YoY (core ~+0.5% holds, pork deflation eases, domestic fuel prices tick positive YoY).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Food deflation (notably pork) and weak goods prices more than offset modest core strength; domestic energy prices stay negative YoY, leaving headline at about -0.1% to -0.3%.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo: Headline CPI has been negative for three straight months (Feb -0.7%, Mar -0.1%, Apr -0.1). Core CPI remains mildly positive (~+0.5%), implying the headline is being pulled down by food and energy. With weak demand signals (manufacturing PMI 49.5; property sales still contracting) and PPI at -2.7% YoY, the backdrop favors ongoing disinflation/deflation at the margin. I give extra weight to the status quo, as month-to-month regime changes are uncommon when core inflation is subdued and demand soft.\n- Components: The research notes pork prices remain below year-ago levels due to high inventories; that has been a key drag. Domestic energy prices reportedly remained negative YoY despite Brent up ~4% YoY in May—suggesting regulated prices/utilities and base effects still weigh. If food and energy remain a net drag similar to April, headline likely stays slightly negative.\n- Offsetting factors: May Day travel can buoy services prices, and oil’s YoY increase could start turning domestic energy less negative or slightly positive. These could push the print toward 0.0% or +0.1%—especially given how close the last two prints were to zero.\n- Why not higher than my forecast: Persistent PPI deflation, weak PMIs, and ongoing property stress argue against a quick flip to positive headline inflation. Pork and broader food price weakness likely continue to weigh. Status quo points to a small negative.\n- Why not lower: Core remains positive and some holiday/services support plus potentially less negative energy limit downside. The headline has been hovering near zero; a deeply negative surprise seems unlikely without a new shock.\n- What would move me: I’d lower the Yes probability if high-frequency data showed a clear rebound in pork prices, a decisive turn to positive YoY energy prices (e.g., NDRC pump price hikes with strong pass-through), or stronger-than-expected services inflation tied to holiday demand. I’d raise it if MOA pork/veg prices stayed clearly below last year’s levels into late May and domestic fuel/electricity tariffs remained weak or were cut, reinforcing a negative food/energy contribution.\n- Note on resolution: The question resolves on FRED’s OECD-based series; given the near-zero boundary, small methodological/rounding differences add tail risk around 0.0%.",
