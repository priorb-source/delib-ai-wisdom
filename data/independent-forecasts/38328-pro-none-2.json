    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days (resolves July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. MEPs typically complete their terms, and resignations are infrequent events. In the absence of a specific, powerful catalyst, it is unlikely any of the 720 MEPs would resign in the specified 21-day window.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The period between June 10 and June 30, 2025, passes with no MEPs announcing their resignation. The Huawei lobbying scandal continues to be investigated, but no definitive evidence emerges that forces an immediate resignation, and no MEPs step down for unrelated personal or political reasons.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under mounting pressure from their political group and media scrutiny following the Huawei lobbying scandal, a newly-elected MEP announces their resignation before the end of June to avoid damaging their party's reputation at the start of the new parliamentary term. Alternatively, an MEP resigns for unrelated personal or health reasons within the specified timeframe.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is 30%. The status quo outcome is 'No', as resignations from a body of 720 members are relatively infrequent in any specific three-week window, and politicians typically try to retain their positions. However, two factors elevate the probability of a 'Yes' outcome. First is the general base rate: with 720 members, resignations for various personal, health, or career-related reasons occur periodically, making a resignation in any given 21-day period plausible. The primary driver for this forecast is the specific context provided: the ongoing Huawei lobbying scandal. The resolution window, June 10 to June 30, is a period of maximum political sensitivity, falling directly after the elections and before the new Parliament's first session. There will be immense pressure on any newly-elected MEP implicated in the scandal to resign immediately to prevent reputational damage to their political group at the outset of the new term. This timing acts as a powerful catalyst. My probability is not higher because politicians often attempt to ride out scandals, and investigations may not produce conclusive, resignation-forcing evidence within this short timeframe. It is not lower because the combination of the base-rate possibility of a resignation for any reason, strongly amplified by a timely and politically sensitive scandal, creates a substantial and credible risk. I would increase my forecast if new reports publish more damning evidence directly naming an MEP. I would decrease it if the story loses media traction or if party leadership offers strong public support to any implicated MEPs.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any members of the European Parliament resign before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nEuro News: [Lobbying scandal related to Huawei: What we know so far](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/05/21/lobbying-scandal-related-to-huawei-what-we-know-so-far)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the European Parliament announces their resignation after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
