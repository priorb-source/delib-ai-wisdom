    "review": "Both forecasters lean heavily on December 2024’s six “cube” reports and, in F2’s case, assert a monthly mean of 1.5–2 via a Poisson model. That estimate rests on either a single outlier month or unspecified additional data (“most months” have ≥1) that isn’t cited. They also don’t account for the resolution’s timing constraint: the report must appear on NUFORC’s site by July 1, and NUFORC sometimes posts in batches with lags. Ignoring that constraint likely overstates the odds. I agree with their general points that (a) cubes are a recognized category, (b) June can be higher-volume for sightings, and (c) only one report is needed. But I find their base-rate assumptions and confidence too high given the prompt’s explicit “rare” characterization and the posting-lag risk. December 2024 likely represents a cluster rather than a reliable monthly mean.",
    "rationale": "Key factors: \n- Base rate: The prompt itself labels cube reports as “rare,” and one highlighted month with six suggests an outlier rather than a steady mean near 1.5–2. A more conservative monthly expectation (λ ~ 0.5–0.8) seems more consistent with rarity.\n- Seasonality: June’s higher overall reporting volume nudges the chance up modestly.\n- Classification risk: Some relevant sightings may be labeled “rectangle/box/other,” not “cube,” lowering the observed count under the specific “cube” shape.\n- Posting-lag constraint: The report must be visible on/after July 1. NUFORC’s batch posting cadence means late-June events may miss the cutoff, further lowering the probability relative to the eventual full-month total.\n\nUpdate versus my prior (35%): I move up modestly to 42% to reflect seasonality and the possibility that December 2024’s cluster indicates a non-negligible tail for cubes. I do not move as high as the other forecasters because their arguments rely on an optimistic base rate and omit the timing constraint. My working model is roughly: P(≥1 cube in June) ≈ 50–60% under λ ~ 0.7–0.9, discounted by posting lag and classification issues (~0.7–0.8), yielding ~35–48%. I center near 42%.",
