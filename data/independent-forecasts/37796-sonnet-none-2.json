    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks. The FATF Plenary meeting is scheduled for June 2025, and the outcome will be known shortly after the meeting concludes, likely within days of its completion.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the grey list remains unchanged with all 25 current jurisdictions staying on the list and no new jurisdictions added.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FATF reviews all jurisdictions during its June 2025 Plenary and determines that none of the 25 currently grey-listed countries have completed sufficient action items to warrant removal, while simultaneously finding no new jurisdictions that meet the threshold for strategic deficiencies requiring grey-listing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one jurisdiction makes sufficient progress on its AML/CFT action plan to be removed from the grey list (such as Croatia or Monaco, which have stronger governance structures), and/or at least one new jurisdiction is identified as having strategic deficiencies and is added to the list during the June 2025 Plenary meeting.",
    "rationale": "The February 2025 update provides strong evidence that the FATF actively modifies the grey list, with that single update including one removal (Philippines) and two additions (Laos, Nepal). This demonstrates both that changes occur regularly and that the FATF maintains an active monitoring process. With approximately 4 months between the February and June plenaries, this timeframe aligns with the FATF's typical three-meetings-per-year schedule, suggesting June is a normal decision point for list updates. The question sets a low bar requiring only ANY change (one addition OR one removal), making a positive resolution more likely. With 25 jurisdictions currently listed, there are multiple candidates who may have completed action plans. Countries like Croatia, Monaco, and Bulgaria have relatively strong institutional frameworks that could facilitate faster progress. Additionally, the FATF continuously monitors all jurisdictions globally, creating ongoing possibilities for new additions. My forecast is not higher because: the February update may have addressed the most ready candidates for removal; completing action plans requires substantial, verified progress that takes time; and not every plenary results in changes. My forecast is not lower because: recent precedent strongly indicates active list management; the low bar of 'any change' significantly increases probability; and the 4-month interval provides reasonable time for jurisdictions to demonstrate progress. I would revise upward if reports emerged of specific countries completing action plans or new jurisdictions being evaluated. I would revise downward if the FATF announced procedural changes delaying reviews or if interim reports showed limited progress among current grey-listed countries.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring\" list, which at the time of this question consists of Algeria, Angola, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Mali, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Yemen. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
