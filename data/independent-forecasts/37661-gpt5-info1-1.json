  "information": "The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) granted two 10-year licenses to Starlink Services Bangladesh Limited, as reported on April 30, 2025. This allows the company to provide commercial internet services and import necessary equipment. The approval followed Starlink's registration with the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) on March 29, 2025. Public statements from SpaceX executives and Bangladeshi government officials have targeted a May 2025 launch. In late March, interim leader Muhammad Yunus announced plans to finalize a commercial deal with Starlink within three months. A trial run of the service was conducted on April 9, 2025, during an investment summit.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of today Bangladesh is not shown as Available on Starlink’s map",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite licenses being granted, operational or regulatory steps slip: type approvals or customs/imports take longer; commercial terms, payment rails, or distribution aren’t ready; a security/lawful-intercept condition delays activation; or SpaceX prioritizes other markets, leaving Bangladesh listed as Coming Soon through June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the April 30 licensing and April trial, SpaceX flips Bangladesh to Available in late May or June, begins accepting orders and/or shipping kits, and updates the map to show Availability for at least part of the country before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Key facts: The regulator (BTRC) granted two 10-year licenses on Apr 30, 2025, allowing commercial service and equipment imports. Starlink registered with BIDA on Mar 29. Officials and SpaceX have targeted a May 2025 launch, and a trial was conducted on Apr 9. These are the heavy lifts in many countries; once licensing is in place, Starlink often moves from trial to commercial availability within weeks and updates the availability map accordingly. With roughly six weeks left, a May/June go-live is plausible.\n\nI weight the status quo (currently not available) because slippage is common: even after licensing, there can be delays in type approval, customs clearing of terminals, local payment enablement, pricing/tax decisions, compliance (e.g., lawful intercept), or last-minute political pushback. Starlink also tends to mark a country Available when it can accept orders and ship, not merely when legally cleared. Any of those could push the public map update into July.\n\nWhy not higher: Residual execution and compliance risk; potential for bureaucratic or political delays; Starlink’s internal sequencing/prioritization; and the requirement that the website explicitly show Availability (a public-facing milestone that could lag operational readiness). Why not lower: The core regulatory hurdle appears cleared with long-term licenses and import permission; a public trial has occurred; and public statements aim for a May launch. Historical precedent suggests map changes can follow soon after licensing in new markets.\n\nWhat would move me up: Evidence of terminals clearing customs and being distributed; local pricing published; Starlink enabling orders to Bangladeshi addresses; official government or SpaceX announcement of commercial launch dates; early user installations. What would move me down: Reports of legal challenges or moratoria; additional regulatory conditions (e.g., gateway, interception) not yet met; tax or forex/payment roadblocks; indications from SpaceX of delayed roll-out sequencing beyond June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Bangladesh as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Bangladeshi leader gives final approval to Musk's Starlink service](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/bangladeshi-leader-gives-final-approval-to-musks-starlink-service/3551404)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Bangladesh listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) granted two 10-year licenses to Starlink Services Bangladesh Limited, as reported on April 30, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
