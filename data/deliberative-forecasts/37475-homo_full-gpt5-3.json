    "review": "Both forecasters’ reasoning is broadly aligned with mine: scope is narrow (single day, ~22.7k lbs, 10 states), Johnsonville is experienced, and typical Class I timelines put July 1 within the common closure window. The main additional point I hadn’t emphasized is the publication-timing risk—actions may be complete but the FSIS page might not flip to Closed before the cutoff. They also quantify the days-to-deadline and emphasize the freezers/retail effectiveness-check risks. I find their arguments credible and they nudge me slightly lower than my prior, but still above even odds.",
    "rationale": "I started at 68% based on Johnsonville’s history of 4–8 week closures, the single-day lot, no injuries, and typical 2–4 month Class I closure windows. July 1 is ~12.5 weeks post-announcement, which is inside that window. Downside risks remain: Class I foreign-material cases sometimes expand or require longer verification; FSIS flagged concern about products in consumer freezers; and, importantly, there’s a nontrivial risk the webpage status lags even if the work is done by late June. These considerations argue for trimming a few points. Countervailing: the bounded scope and lack of injuries still support better-than-even odds. I’m slightly lowering my forecast to reflect the publication-lag risk and the tendency of some foreign-material recalls to run 3–4 months, while keeping a modest edge to Yes given the constrained lot and firm competence.",
