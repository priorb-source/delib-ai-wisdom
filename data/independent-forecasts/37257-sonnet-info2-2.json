  "information": "International reactions to the political situation in Republika Srpska are varied. The U.S. and EU have expressed strong opposition to secession, with a U.S. envoy labeling RS's proposals as \"secession by another name.\" The U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo has warned that disobeying the decisions of Bosnia's Constitutional Court, such as celebrating the banned January 9th holiday, may constitute a criminal offense. In contrast, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković has expressed support for Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership while voicing concern over secessionist rhetoric from RS, warning that delays in EU integration could allow Russia and China to increase their influence. Russia has appeared supportive of moves by RS, and a Russian military documentary film festival was scheduled to take place in Banja Luka in May 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Republika Srpska continues its pattern of secessionist rhetoric and provocative actions without officially announcing a referendum date",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "RS leadership continues its current approach of provocative statements and actions (like celebrating the banned January 9th holiday) but stops short of officially scheduling an independence referendum, likely due to strong U.S. and EU opposition, fears of economic sanctions, concerns about violent conflict, and the historical pattern of using referendum threats as leverage rather than actually following through",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "RS President Milorad Dodik or another authorized official announces a specific date for an independence referendum, potentially emboldened by Russian support, domestic political pressure, or calculating that the timing is favorable given stalled EU integration. The announcement could come as an escalation of current tensions even if the referendum itself never occurs or is blocked by the international community",
    "rationale": "With only 2 months remaining until the resolution date, the base rate for this outcome is relatively low. Historically, RS leadership has repeatedly threatened referendums but has not followed through with actually scheduling them - this is a pattern of brinkmanship rather than concrete action. The research assistant's report confirms strong U.S. and EU opposition to secession, with warnings about criminal offenses and implicit threats of consequences. This represents significant deterrence against actually announcing a referendum. The Croatian PM's warning about Russian and Chinese influence if EU integration stalls suggests regional concern but also indicates that major powers are watching closely and would likely intervene. However, several factors prevent this from being a very low probability: (1) The question only requires an announcement, not an actual referendum, which is a lower bar; (2) Russian support provides some backing for provocative actions; (3) RS has shown willingness to defy Bosnian authorities (celebrating banned holidays); (4) Only 2 months leaves room for a sudden escalation. The forecast is not higher because there's no indication such an announcement is imminent, international deterrence is strong, and the historical pattern favors continued threats without action. It's not lower because geopolitical volatility exists, the timeframe allows for surprises, and the bar (announcement only) is relatively low. I would update upward if: RS makes explicit statements about scheduling a referendum soon, Russian support becomes more explicit, or EU/US attention diverts elsewhere. I would update downward if: strong sanctions are preemptively threatened, RS leadership makes conciliatory statements, or the international community increases engagement in Bosnia",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nInternational reactions to the political situation in Republika Srpska are varied. The U.S. and EU have expressed strong opposition to secession, with a U.S. envoy labeling RS's proposals as \"secession by another name.\" The U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo has warned that disobeying the decisions of Bosnia's Constitutional Court, such as celebrating the banned January 9th holiday, may constitute a criminal offense.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
