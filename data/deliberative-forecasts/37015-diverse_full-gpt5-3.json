    "review": "Both forecasters’ arguments align closely with my prior view: strong structural, normative, and timing headwinds versus a small but real elite-driven “draft” pathway. Forecaster 2 usefully highlights the theoretical (but unconventional) routes of an independent bid or PPP rules change; Forecaster 3 clearly enumerates concrete signals that would shift probabilities. Neither brings materially new evidence beyond what I had considered. I agree with their emphasis on missed PPP primary registration, weak polling/acceptability, caretaker norms, lack of visible campaign prep, and the legal need to resign by May 4. I also concur that internal PPP pressure keeps the probability above zero.",
    "rationale": "My core reasoning stands: the base case is no announcement, given (1) missed PPP primary inclusion and public signals from leadership, (2) sharply unfavorable polling and acceptability metrics, (3) strong caretaker neutrality norms and the 2017 Hwang Kyo-ahn precedent, (4) no visible campaign infrastructure with very little time, and (5) the legal resignation deadline (May 4) increasing the personal and institutional costs of proceeding. The only live upside scenario is a rapid, elite-coordinated “draft” where PPP leadership pivots, frames Han as a unity/stability candidate, and he resigns and announces in quick succession. The resolution criterion being “announcement” (not formal nomination/ballot access) lowers the bar somewhat, but in practice he’s unlikely to announce without simultaneously resolving the legitimacy/eligibility optics, which implies a resignation plus clear party pathway. I would move up only on concrete signs: PPP emergency committee maneuvering to clear a path, top-tier endorsements and media leaks that resignation paperwork is in motion, or a quick polling swing. Absent such signals, I see no reason to change my estimate.",
