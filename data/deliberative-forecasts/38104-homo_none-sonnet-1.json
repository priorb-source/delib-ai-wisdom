    "review": "All three forecasts cluster between 28-40%, suggesting general agreement on the difficulty of this outcome. Forecaster 3 makes the strongest point about the question structure heavily favoring No - this asymmetry is critical. Even 90% success (9 of 10 recaptured) results in a No resolution. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the substantial time remaining (32 days) and early manhunt success as positive indicators. What strikes me most is that none of us provided concrete historical base rates for complete jailbreak recaptures. If I think probabilistically: assuming each remaining escapee has an independent 80% chance of recapture (generous), the probability of all 7 being caught is only 0.8^7 = 21%. Even with 90% individual probability, it's 0.9^7 = 48%. This suggests our forecasts may still be too optimistic. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the structural bias toward No is particularly compelling given the mathematics involved.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm persuaded by Forecaster 3's argument about the question structure creating a strong bias toward No. The all-or-nothing requirement means that even excellent performance by law enforcement (recapturing 9 of 10) still resolves as No. With at least 7 escapees at large as of May 19 and 11 days of information lag, probabilistically achieving 100% recapture becomes increasingly difficult. The early 30% recapture rate was encouraging, but those were likely the easiest targets. The remaining escapees who've evaded capture for 2+ weeks are likely more sophisticated, better resourced, or have fled the jurisdiction. While 32 days provides meaningful time for continued operations, it also allows escapees to solidify hiding arrangements or escape the region entirely. The multiplicative probability issue - needing every single remaining escapee to be caught - creates a significantly lower probability than if we were asking about most or even 8 of 10. I'm updating my forecast downward to better reflect this structural challenge and the mathematical reality of requiring universal success.",
