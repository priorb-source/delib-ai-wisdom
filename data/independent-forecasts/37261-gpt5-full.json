  "information": "The '50501' movement, a decentralized organization originating from a Reddit forum, planned nationwide protests on May 1, 2025, coinciding with International Workers' Day. The protests were organized to oppose the Trump administration's policies on immigration and labor. The movement's website listed over 1,000 events across all 50 states, with major demonstrations expected in Washington D.C., Chicago, Denver, Seattle, and Los Angeles. Organizations supporting the protests included the Political Revolution PAC and the Service Employees International Union. News reports following the event stated that over 1,100 protests took place under the '50501' banner across the U.S. and worldwide.\n\nOn April 5, 2025, demonstrations under the \"Hands Off!\" campaign occurred across all 50 U.S. states and in several international cities. A coalition of over 150 groups, including Indivisible and MoveOn, organized the events in response to administration policies such as federal layoffs, rising tariffs, and civil rights rollbacks. Participation estimates varied: one report cited over 1,400 events with nearly 600,000 attendees, while another stated over 600,000 people participated in more than 1,200 rallies. Solidarity protests were also held in cities like Berlin, London, and Paris.\n\nData from the Crowd Counting Consortium from early 2025 showed a notable trend in protest activity. The consortium recorded 2,085 protests nationwide in February 2025, more than double the 937 recorded in February 2017. However, the data also indicated that the average size of these events had decreased to an estimated 60-88 participants per protest. In separate protest movements, over 300 actions were reported on university campuses related to the conflict in Israel.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No single U.S. protest with 10,000+ participants occurs in May–June, campus actions remain decentralized and sub-10k per site, and/or the Global Protest Tracker either does not add a U.S. entry for these months or lists sizes ambiguously (e.g., “thousands”) rather than 10,000+.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A large, high-salience march (e.g., in Washington, D.C., New York, or Los Angeles) draws tens of thousands in response to a major policy move or late-June Supreme Court decision; or Carnegie backfills an April 5 or May 1 nationwide action with an entry explicitly noting 10,000+ participants in at least one U.S. city, with a start date in the eligible window.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: As of May 2, the Global Protest Tracker (GPT) has not yet reported a qualifying U.S. protest since launch (“criteria have not yet been satisfied”). The tracker is curated and does not capture every protest; it tends to feature especially large or salient events and sometimes uses non-specific size labels. With roughly two months remaining, the status quo slightly favors “No.”\n\nEvidence pushing toward “Yes”:\n- The research assistant cites two nationwide mobilizations in the window: the April 5 “Hands Off!” actions and the May 1 “50501” May Day protests, with reporting of 1,200–1,400 events and aggregate participation around 600,000. If accurate, it is plausible at least one major city exceeded 10,000 participants, which could merit a GPT entry and satisfy the 10,000+ criterion if GPT explicitly reports that magnitude.\n- The sociopolitical context (early months of a new administration, ongoing Israel–Gaza protests, potential flashpoints) increases chances of a large march before July, particularly around late-June Supreme Court decisions.\n\nEvidence pushing toward “No”:\n- The Crowd Counting Consortium data suggests the current protest landscape is highly active but fragmented, with average event sizes reportedly 60–88 participants. That implies fewer mega-protests, even if totals are large when aggregated.\n- GPT inclusion is the binding constraint. Many U.S. protests (even sizable ones) are never added, or are described as “thousands” rather than “10,000+,” which would not meet the question’s explicit threshold.\n- Update lag/selection: As of May 2, GPT has not (yet) logged an eligible U.S. entry despite April 5/May 1 activity, indicating either they won’t include those actions or will be slow/ambiguous in how they list size.\n- The start-date-after-launch requirement adds a failure mode if the question launched after any large event (uncertainty here), and only May–June events would count.\n\nWhy not higher: The decisive factor is GPT’s curation and size-labeling. Even if big protests occur, they may not be recorded or quantified as 10,000+. The average size trend also points against frequent mega-protests.\n\nWhy not lower: There are multiple plausible paths to a qualifying event: a single large DC/NYC/LA march in May–June, or GPT backfilling an April 5 or May 1 action with an explicit 10,000+ figure. The political calendar (e.g., SCOTUS decisions) creates tail risk for a large mobilization.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting of an announced, large national march before July; evidence that a specific city on April 5 or May 1 drew 10,000+ and GPT tends to add such events; or GPT adding an eligible U.S. entry with 10,000+ language.\n\nWhat would move me down: Several weeks without any GPT U.S. additions; indications that GPT is avoiding U.S. events in this period or labeling sizes only as “thousands;” lack of any announced large mobilizations in June.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
