    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 27 days (until Metaculus checks the MLB standings on or after June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — another team (e.g., White Sox/Marlins/A’s/Angels) is more likely to currently hold the worst winning percentage, with the Rockies among the bottom tier but not clearly the single lowest.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One of the other cellar teams continues to underperform (or stays level) while the Rockies play roughly .400–.450 ball over the next ~25 games, keeping them above at least one rival for the basement when the standings are checked.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies hit a cold stretch (e.g., 6–17 over their next ~23 games) and/or a direct rival for last place goes on a mild uptick. Tough NL West matchups or key injuries depress Colorado’s short-term results, leaving them at the bottom (ties for the lowest percentage likely count).",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and status quo: With ~4 weeks to go, standings are somewhat sticky over this short horizon, but bottom-tier teams can swap positions with a short skid or streak. The Rockies are very likely a bottom-5 team in true talent, but there are several credible competitors for the league’s worst record (recent seasons suggest the White Sox, Marlins, A’s, Angels, and possibly one surprise struggler as candidates). Given typical early-season spreads, it’s more probable that at least one other team is slightly worse right now.\n- Short-horizon dynamics: Over ~20–25 games, variance is meaningful but limited; climbing from second-worst to worst (or vice versa) typically requires a few-game swing plus some cooperation from rivals. If Colorado is not already in sole possession of last today, the chance they end up there by June 15 is materially below 50%.\n- Multiple contenders: If 3–4 teams are clustered near the bottom, any single team’s chance to be last on a specific check date is often around 15–30%, unless it already has the worst record by a clear margin. I weight the Rockies slightly higher than an equal-share prior because of their roster/talent context and difficult divisional schedule, but I keep the probability modest due to the presence of other very weak teams and the short runway.\n- Resolution nuance: The exact timing of the Metaculus check (on or after June 15) adds a bit of randomness day-to-day, tempering confidence either way.\n- Why not higher? Because other teams plausibly have an equal or worse current record; the time window is short; and minor win-loss noise or soft opponents for a rival can keep Colorado off the very bottom.\n- Why not lower? The Rockies are credible bottom-tier; a short cold spell could drop them past rivals, and ties for the lowest winning percentage likely count.\n- Updates that would move me up: Evidence that Colorado already holds the worst W% or is within a game of it; injuries to key Rockies players; an upcoming slate heavy with elite opponents; signs rivals are improving (call-ups, returns from IL, softer schedules).\n- Updates that would move me down: Confirmation that another team is clearly worst by multiple games; Rockies getting healthier or facing a soft stretch; rivals suffering injuries that likely keep them below Colorado.\n- Research assistant note: No additional information provided; forecast rests on priors about team quality, typical early/mid-season variance, and the presence of multiple weak teams.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMile High Sports: [The Colorado Rockies have lost a generation of fans](https://milehighsports.com/the-colorado-rockies-have-lost-a-generation-of-fans/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
