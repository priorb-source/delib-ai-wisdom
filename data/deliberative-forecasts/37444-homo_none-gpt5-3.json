    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my baseline: short runway, high political/symbolic cost, and low practical payoff from delisting an inoperable pipeline. Useful additions: explicit reference to PEESA waiver mechanics and the point that licenses/waivers or other energy measures wouldn’t satisfy this question’s resolution (the entity must be delisted from SDN to disappear from the OFAC search). They also emphasize the menu of lower‑cost alternatives the White House could use to signal sanctions easing without touching Nord Stream 2 AG, which further lowers the likelihood that this specific delisting is chosen as the near‑term vehicle. The idea of bundling a delisting into a larger diplomatic or energy package is a fair reason to keep a non‑trivial tail. No new hard evidence surfaced beyond the April 23 Politico report; the passage of time without corroborating signals marginally lowers odds.",
    "rationale": "Roughly eight weeks remain. OFAC can technically delist quickly once directed, but Russia‑related SDN delistings are rare without a clear policy shift and strong interagency alignment. Delisting Nord Stream 2 AG is uniquely high‑salience and low‑benefit: the pipeline is damaged/idle, Germany halted certification, and Europe isn’t seeking its revival. If the administration wants to adjust Russia energy sanctions, there are easier, less symbolic levers (licenses, guidance, enforcement posture) that would not remove NS2 AG from the SDN list and thus would not resolve this question as Yes. The April 23 Politico piece indicates active internal debate, keeping a real—though modest—chance that a broader shift is packaged with an NS2 AG delisting. However, the lack of follow‑on reporting or preparatory signaling since then, combined with expected congressional and allied optics costs, makes a pre‑July 1 delisting unlikely. Balancing these, I slightly trim my prior estimate to reflect time decay and reinforced arguments about low payoff and availability of alternatives.",
