    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be determined by July 1, 2025, which is 26 days from today's date of June 5, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. A search of the New York Times website for the exact phrases \"reverse purchasing\" and \"reverse purchase\" currently yields zero results. Therefore, the status quo is that the term is not used by the publication.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The New York Times may publish articles on changing consumer habits in China but describes the phenomenon of traveling to cheaper cities for goods using more common English phrases like \"bargain-hunting trips\" or \"domestic shopping tourism,\" without ever using the specific term \"reverse purchasing.\"",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A New York Times correspondent, reporting on the Chinese economy or youth culture, writes a feature on the trend of young consumers seeking deals in smaller cities. To add specific detail, the reporter includes the Chinese term for the trend and its direct English translation, \"reverse purchasing,\" which they sourced from local media or interviews.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is based on the high probability of the status quo persisting. The base rate for a novel, translated term like \"reverse purchasing\" being adopted by a major news organization like The New York Times within a very short timeframe is extremely low. The publication has its own style guide and tends to use established or more descriptive terminology. Current searches confirm the term has never been used by the NYT. The primary factor supporting a 'No' outcome is journalistic practice; reporters are more likely to describe a phenomenon in their own clear language than to adopt niche jargon from foreign state media. The forecast is not lower than 5% because the underlying trend of thrifty Chinese consumers is a plausible topic for the NYT's business or world sections. The existence of a specific name for the trend in Chinese media ('反向消费') creates a small but real possibility that a reporter will mention it for authenticity. My forecast is not higher because the linguistic barrier and the short time window make adoption of the term highly unlikely. I would raise my probability if other major English-language news sources (e.g., Bloomberg, The Economist) begin using the term. I would lower it if the NYT reports on the general topic of Chinese consumer trends within the resolution window but omits this specific phrase.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the New York Times mention \"reverse purchasing\" before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPeople's Daily: [“Reverse purchasing” reflects the vitality of the Chinese market](http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2025/0430/c1004-40471159.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the NY Times mentions \"reverse purchasing\" in any of its content items as found through [this search](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchasing%22&sort=best), dated after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025. This question will also count \"reverse purchase,\" which can be found through [this link](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchase%22&sort=best).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
