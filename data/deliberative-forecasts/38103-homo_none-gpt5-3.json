    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the key resolution nuance: the Metaculus check is tied to that specific BC Hydro page explicitly naming Tesla as ineligible. They argue the policy itself is sticky but recognize a non-trivial risk that BC Hydro switches to generic eligibility language or relocates the brand-specific callout, which would resolve No despite no substantive policy change. This matches my initial thinking, but they sharpen the communication-structure risk (e.g., moving to an eligible-products list or generic origin-based criteria). I find their reasoning sound; no new factual evidence, but a useful reframing of the messaging-risk channel and typical government web-update cadence over a month.",
    "rationale": "- Time to resolution: ~32 days. Short horizon favors status quo.  \n- Status quo: As of Mar 12, 2025, Tesla is explicitly excluded from CleanBC/BC Hydro rebates, and the page reportedly names Tesla. Political backing for Canadian-preference suggests persistence.  \n- Yes path (most likely): Policy unchanged and the page continues to explicitly say Tesla is ineligible through July 1. High customer relevance (Tesla’s market share) supports keeping the callout to reduce inquiries.  \n- No paths (meaningful but smaller): (1) Policy unchanged but BC Hydro edits the page to generic origin-based criteria or an eligible list without naming ineligible brands; (2) the explicit Tesla mention moves to a different page/FAQ; (3) low-probability policy softening/reversal due to legal/trade/political pushback.  \n- Net: With little time left and clear political direction, I still expect the explicit mention to remain. However, peers’ emphasis on communications normalization raises my estimate of the “genericization/migration” risk slightly. I trim my forecast modestly to account for that channel.\n",
