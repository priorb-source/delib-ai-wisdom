    "review": "Forecaster 2 added concrete recent prints (Feb -0.7%, Mar -0.1%, Apr -0.1%), April PPI -2.7% y/y, and core CPI ~+0.5% y/y. That specificity sharpens the picture that headline is hovering very close to zero with mild disinflationary momentum. Forecaster 3 contributed May PMI signals (mfg 49.5, non-mfg 50.3) and continued property weakness, reinforcing weak demand. Both stress May Day services seasonality as a plausible nudge to zero/positive, with pork as the key swing factor. I hadn’t explicitly incorporated the size of April PPI deflation or the PMIs; both support ongoing price softness but also highlight how near the line we are. F2’s below-50% stance feels a bit low given continuing food/energy drags; F3’s ~60% aligns with my base case but with better balance on holiday services risk.",
    "rationale": "My prior 68% leaned too strongly toward continued deflation given how close headline is to zero and the likelihood of May holiday services firmness. Updating with: (1) three straight negatives narrowing from -0.7% to -0.1% suggests momentum toward zero; (2) April PPI -2.7% indicates upstream deflation persists, limiting upside but not guaranteeing another negative; (3) May PMIs and property data imply weak demand, consistent with soft goods prices; (4) the assistant’s note that domestic energy and pork remained negative y/y keeps a modest edge to a negative headline. Net: headline is a coin flip near zero, but with food/energy drags I still lean slightly Yes. I’m trimming from 68% to 61% to reflect the credible risk that May services and any pork stabilization could tip headline to flat/slightly positive.",
