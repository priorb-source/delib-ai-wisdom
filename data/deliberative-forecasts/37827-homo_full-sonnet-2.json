    "review": "Both forecasters present well-structured analyses that closely align with my own base rate calculations. Their convergence on 5% is notable and their reasoning is sound. Forecaster 3 makes an important point I had considered but perhaps underweighted: the January 2025 Rwanda report 'doesn't meaningfully increase the probability for June specifically' since these appear to be independent events randomly distributed over time. I had noted this as 'unusual recent activity' but may have still given it excessive weight in pushing toward 6%. Forecaster 2's emphasis that 'good forecasting demands heavy weight on status quo' is a valuable reminder - the base rate is 3-5%, and I'm already at or above the upper bound without strong justification. Both forecasters correctly identify that with such a small historical sample (4-6 events over 10 years), we should anchor heavily to the empirical frequency rather than speculate about trends from a single data point.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my 6% forecast was weakly justified. The pure base rate calculation yields 3.3-5% (0.033-0.05 reports per month), and while I cited 'modest uncertainty' and 'some variance' as reasons to go slightly higher, these factors don't clearly push upward rather than downward. The January 2025 Rwanda report demonstrates the mechanism works but doesn't establish a trend - it could easily be the only African pilot report for all of 2025, consistent with historical patterns. The convergence of all three forecasters around 5% based on solid empirical reasoning is compelling. My original justification for being at 6% rather than 5% - accounting for the recent Rwanda report and variance - doesn't withstand scrutiny since the base rate already incorporates these considerations. I should anchor more firmly to the middle of the empirical range rather than its upper bound without stronger evidence of systematic change.",
