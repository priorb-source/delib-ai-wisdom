    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 7 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Without current approval rating data from May 2025, I cannot definitively state the status quo, but the question implies Mark Carney is currently serving as Canadian Prime Minister",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Donald Trump maintains or improves his approval rating to meet or exceed Mark Carney's rating. This could occur if Trump experiences policy successes, positive economic news, or successful foreign policy outcomes, while Carney faces early governing challenges, unpopular policy decisions, or controversy that dampens his approval ratings",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mark Carney maintains higher approval than Trump through July 1st. This is plausible if Carney is benefiting from a 'honeymoon period' as a new Prime Minister with fresh policy initiatives and public goodwill, while Trump's approval remains at his historically polarized levels (typically low-to-mid 40s percentage range based on his previous term)",
    "rationale": "This forecast involves significant uncertainty due to lack of current approval data from my research assistant. Key factors to consider: (1) Historical pattern - Trump's approval ratings during his previous presidency were consistently polarized, typically ranging 40-46%, with strong base support but limited crossover appeal. (2) New leader advantage - If Mark Carney recently became PM (which the question's framing suggests), new leaders typically experience honeymoon periods with elevated approval ratings. (3) Cross-country comparison - Canadian and US political cultures differ, affecting approval rating patterns. (4) Time horizon - With only 7 weeks until resolution, major shifts are unlikely unless significant events occur. The forecast is not higher because: Trump has a solid base that keeps his floor relatively high, and we lack concrete current data on either leader's ratings. The forecast is not lower because: new PMs typically outperform established leaders with polarized ratings, and Trump's ceiling has historically been limited. To update higher, I would need: evidence of current Carney approval significantly exceeding Trump's, or indicators of Trump facing major approval challenges. To update lower, I would need: evidence Carney is struggling early in his tenure, or Trump experiencing unusually high approval.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mark Carney has a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
