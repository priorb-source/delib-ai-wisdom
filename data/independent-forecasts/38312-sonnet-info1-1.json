  "information": "As of early June 2025, India has not received an official invitation to the G7 summit scheduled to take place in Canada from June 15-17. Multiple media outlets, including The Tribune and the Hindustan Times, have reported this, citing official sources. These reports indicate that no advance preparations for a high-level visit from India are underway. This is contrary to the protocol for such trips, which are typically planned weeks in advance for security and logistical coordination. Canada has extended invitations to other non-G7 countries, including Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "12-14 days. The G7 Summit is scheduled for June 15-17, 2025, and today is June 3, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, Modi will not attend. India has not received an official invitation as of June 3, and there are no advance preparations underway for a high-level Indian visit.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Canada does not extend an invitation to India before the summit, or extends one too late for proper security and logistical preparations to be completed. Given the strained diplomatic relations between India and Canada and the extremely tight 12-day timeframe, Modi does not attend the summit.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Canada extends a last-minute invitation to India in the next few days, perhaps due to diplomatic pressure from other G7 members or a sudden thaw in Canada-India relations. India accepts and rapidly organizes security and logistics, with Modi prioritizing attendance despite the short notice and apparent diplomatic slight.",
    "rationale": "The evidence overwhelmingly points toward Modi not attending. My research assistant confirms that as of early June 2025, India has not received an official invitation to the G7 summit scheduled for June 15-17 in Canada, with only 12 days remaining. Multiple credible sources (The Tribune, Hindustan Times) report no advance preparations are underway, which is contrary to standard protocol for high-level visits that typically require weeks of planning for security and logistics. Notably, Canada has invited other non-G7 countries including Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil, but conspicuously not India. The status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome, and good forecasters weight the status quo heavily as the world changes slowly. For Modi to attend would require: (1) a sudden diplomatic breakthrough in Canada-India relations, which are currently strained, (2) an invitation issued within the next 2-3 days, (3) completion of security and logistical preparations in an unprecedented 9-10 day timeframe, and (4) India's willingness to accept what appears to be a last-minute, potentially face-losing invitation. My forecast is not lower (below 5%) because there is still technically sufficient time for an invitation, diplomatic situations can occasionally shift rapidly, and India remains strategically important enough that emergency outreach is possible. My forecast is not higher (above 10%) because the timeline is extremely compressed, no invitation has been extended despite Canada inviting multiple other countries, advance preparations are absent, and India-Canada relations remain tense. For me to update upward, I would need to see: an official invitation extended to India, announcements of security preparations beginning, or diplomatic signals of reconciliation. For me to update downward, the passage of another 5-7 days without an invitation would make attendance virtually impossible.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill India's PM Narendra Modi attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of India: [Canada invites Australia, Ukraine for G7 meet but no call for India yet](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-invites-australia-ukraine-for-g7-meet-but-no-call-for-india-yet/articleshow/121398906.cms)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early June 2025, India has not received an official invitation to the G7 summit scheduled to take place in Canada from June 15-17.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
