  "information": "The middleweight bout between Joe Pyfer and Kelvin Gastelum is scheduled for the main card of UFC 316, which will take place on June 7, 2025, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. This is a rebooked fight, originally scheduled for UFC Mexico on March 29 before being cancelled. According to UFCStats 'tale of the tape' data, Pyfer has a slight grappling and reach advantage, while Gastelum fights from a southpaw stance.\n\nJoe Pyfer has won six of his last seven professional fights, holding a 4-1 record within the UFC. His most recent victory was a first-round knockout of Marc-Andre Barriault at UFC 303, which earned him a Performance of the Night bonus. Pyfer had to withdraw from the originally scheduled fight against Gastelum in Mexico due to an illness.\n\nKelvin Gastelum is a veteran fighter and the winner of 'The Ultimate Fighter 17'. The fight at UFC 316 will mark his 24th appearance in the UFC Octagon. He has won two of his last three fights, with his most recent competition being a unanimous decision victory over Daniel Rodriguez in June 2024 at UFC Saudi Arabia.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12 days (event date: 2025-06-07)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The bout proceeds as scheduled: Joe Pyfer vs. Kelvin Gastelum on the UFC 316 main card; outcome likely decided in the cage that night, with Pyfer a slight favorite in a competitive matchup.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "- The fight is canceled and Pyfer does not get a replacement at UFC 316.\n- Pyfer fights but loses to Gastelum (or to a replacement), or the result is a draw/no contest.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "- Pyfer fights Gastelum as scheduled at UFC 316 and wins by KO/TKO, submission, or decision.\n- Gastelum withdraws but Pyfer remains on the card against a short-notice replacement and wins.",
    "rationale": "Framing the forecast as: P(Yes) = P(Pyfer fights at UFC 316) × P(Pyfer wins | he fights).\n\nFight occurrence: With ~12 days to go and the bout rebooked for the main card, late-cancellation risk is present but modest. For UFC main-card fights within two weeks, a rough base rate for a cancellation or opponent change is around 5–15%. I estimate ~90% that Pyfer fights someone on June 7 (about 85% it’s still Gastelum, ~5% a replacement) and ~10% that he does not fight at all.\n\nWin chance if it happens: Against Gastelum, this profiles as a close but slightly Pyfer-leaning matchup. Factors favoring Pyfer: size/reach, power, and some grappling edge per the assistant’s summary; recent form in the UFC has generally been strong (assistant notes 4-1 UFC and a recent KO, though I have not independently verified the specific UFC 303 result, so I weigh that lightly). Risks: Gastelum’s veteran experience, durability, and well-rounded boxing/wrestling; Pyfer showed some cardio/pace questions in prior step-up (e.g., Hermansson), which could matter if this goes long. On balance, I put P(win | Gastelum) around 57% in a three-round fight. If Gastelum withdraws and a short-notice replacement steps in, Pyfer would likely be favored more due to opponent preparation constraints; I’d estimate ~65% in that scenario. Small chances of draw/NC slightly reduce the effective win probability but are already implicitly in these rounded figures.\n\nPutting it together: 0.85 × 0.57 + 0.05 × 0.65 ≈ 0.517. Rounding and acknowledging uncertainty yields about 52%.\n\nWhy not higher: Competitive opponent with strong durability/experience; possible cardio/pace edge for Gastelum over three rounds; late-week volatility (weigh-cuts, illness) and small draw/NC risks; non-zero chance the fight falls off.\n\nWhy not lower: The fight is close to event day and likely to proceed; stylistic and physical edges slightly favor Pyfer; if there’s a replacement, short notice would tend to benefit Pyfer.\n\nWhat would move me up: Market odds making Pyfer a clear favorite (e.g., −150 or better), positive health/camp reports, Gastelum struggling at weigh-ins, or news of a short-notice replacement who is a softer matchup.\n\nWhat would move me down: Reports of Pyfer illness/injury, market odds flipping to favor Gastelum, Gastelum looking exceptionally sharp at the cut, or opponent change to a difficult stylistic matchup.",
