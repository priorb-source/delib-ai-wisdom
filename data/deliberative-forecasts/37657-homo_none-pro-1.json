    "review": "The other two forecasters arrived at the same 1% probability as I did, and for largely the same core reasons: the extremely short timeframe of roughly six weeks and the low base rate for a newly discovered animal virus to cause a reported human infection. Our reasoning is highly aligned on the primary drivers of the forecast.\n\nForecaster 2 introduced a new point I had not explicitly considered: that HKU5-CoV-2 being a merbecovirus (the same subgenus as MERS-CoV) provides a slightly stronger biological basis for potential human infection compared to a random coronavirus. This is a valid point that supports keeping the forecast above a truly negligible level.\n\nForecaster 3 raised an excellent counterpoint regarding the source of the information. The discovery is reported on a non-primary website, not in a peer-reviewed journal or by a major public health body. This severely undermines the significance of the discovery and makes it highly unlikely that credible bodies like the WHO or CDC would even have this virus on their radar to attribute a case to it within the timeframe. This argument strongly reinforces the 'No' outcome.\n\nOverall, the new arguments are convincing but pull in opposite directions. The merbecovirus point slightly increases the 'plausibility' of infection, while the weak source point significantly decreases the probability of 'detection and reporting' as required by the resolution criteria. I find the latter argument more impactful on the final outcome, as official reporting is key. Since these new considerations effectively cancel each other out or even strengthen the case for 'No', I find no reason to move from our consensus forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from my fellow forecasters, I am maintaining my forecast of 1%. The consensus on the core issue—that the ~6-week timeframe is far too short for the unlikely chain of events (zoonotic spillover, symptom development, medical detection, specific viral identification, and official reporting by a credible body) to occur—remains the overwhelmingly dominant factor.\n\nMy reasoning is now bolstered by two additional points raised during deliberation:\n\n1.  The fact that HKU5-CoV-2 is a merbecovirus, the same subgenus as MERS-CoV, confirms that the virus belongs to a group with known zoonotic potential. This reinforces my decision not to lower the forecast below 1%, as it provides a plausible biological pathway for human infection, however unlikely a specific instance may be.\n\n2.  Conversely, the observation that the only source for this virus's discovery is not a primary scientific or public health source is a significant factor strengthening the 'No' case. For this question to resolve 'Yes', a credible body like the WHO or CDC must report a case. It is highly improbable they would do so for a virus that is not recognized in peer-reviewed literature or on their own surveillance dashboards. Even if a person were infected, the case would likely be categorized as a generic 'novel coronavirus infection' pending further investigation, which would extend beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline.\n\nThese two points pull in opposite directions but do not fundamentally alter the initial assessment. The biological plausibility is tempered by the extreme unlikelihood of official detection and reporting of this specific, obscurely-sourced virus within the given timeframe. Therefore, a 1% forecast continues to appropriately represent a tail-risk event that is possible but highly improbable.",
