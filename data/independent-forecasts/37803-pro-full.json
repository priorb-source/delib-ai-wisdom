  "information": "The current administration's Department of Defense leadership has explicitly stated a policy shift away from climate initiatives. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth remarked that the DoD should focus on \"war-fighting\" and that climate programs are \"ripe for cuts.\" In other statements, Hegseth said, \"The Department of Defense is not concerned with climate nonsense; it's about preparing and conducting war.\" The administration has officially ceased to consider climate change a national security issue and revoked a January 2021 executive order on combating the climate crisis.\n\nSpecific actions have been taken to dismantle climate-related military programs. The U.S. Navy officially rescinded its 'Climate Action 2030' plan, a Biden-era initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Navy Secretary John Phelan announced the decision, emphasizing a renewed focus on \"lethality and our warfighters.\" Furthermore, the Department of Defense has removed $377 million in funding for climate change reduction programs. Other initiatives, such as the Air Force's 'Sustainable Aviation Fuel' program and the Army's plan for tactical vehicle electrification, have also been put in doubt or deemed impractical.\n\nThe Department of Defense's official climate resilience portal, climate.mil, has been offline since January 21, 2025. This takedown is part of a broader removal of climate-related content across various federal websites. Historical precedent from the 2017-2021 Trump administration shows that similar websites taken offline, such as pages on the Environmental Protection Agency's site, often remained down for several years. While some Democratic senators have reportedly demanded an explanation for the portal's removal and may hold hearings in June, no binding mandate or official plan to restore the website has been announced.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately six weeks, with the resolution date being July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The website is currently offline and the administration's policy is to actively dismantle climate-related programs. Barring a significant change, the site will remain down.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Department of Defense continues to follow the administration's stated policy of removing climate-related content and initiatives. The website remains offline past July 1, 2025, consistent with the actions taken since January.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Strong and effective pressure from congressional hearings or a successful legal challenge compels the administration to restore the site. Alternatively, a sub-agency within the DoD restores the site for technical or archival reasons, and it remains online through the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is strongly influenced by the status quo and the current administration's clear policy direction. The website is already offline. The research provided indicates a top-down, ideologically driven effort to remove climate change from the national security discussion. This is supported by specific actions, including the Secretary of Defense's public statements branding climate programs as 'nonsense,' the rescinding of the Navy's 'Climate Action 2030' plan, and the removal of $377 million in related funding. The historical precedent from the 2017-2021 administration, where similar websites were taken down and remained offline for years, reinforces the likelihood that this is a long-term change, not a temporary one. The probability is not lower than 5% because there is some potential for countervailing forces. Planned congressional hearings could generate sufficient political pressure for a reversal, though this seems unlikely to be effective in such a short timeframe. There is also a small chance of a bureaucratic restoration at a lower level or a successful, expedited legal challenge. The probability is not higher because the opposition is fragmented and lacks a clear mechanism to force the administration's hand, while the administration's policy, actions, and rhetoric are all consistently and strongly aligned with keeping the website offline. I would increase my forecast if a court ordered the site's restoration or if key Republican senators joined Democrats in demanding it. I would decrease my forecast if the DoD issued an official statement confirming the permanent deletion of the portal and its assets.",
