    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, the flightsfrom.com website lists 30 direct flight destinations from Erbil (EBL), which is not greater than 31.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The summer travel season brings only one new seasonal destination, or any new routes are offset by the cancellation of existing ones due to low profitability or operational changes. The total number of destinations remains at 31 or fewer.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Airlines, anticipating a strong tourist and VFR (Visiting Friends and Relatives) season as suggested by the positive outlook for 'Kurdistan Summer 2025', launch at least two net new seasonal or year-round routes to destinations in Europe or the Gulf, pushing the total count to 32 or more.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the current number of routes being very close to the threshold and the specific timing of the resolution date. The status quo is 30 destinations, which would resolve this question as 'No'. The world generally changes slowly, which provides a strong anchor for a 'No' outcome. However, the resolution date of July 1st falls at the very beginning of the peak summer travel season. This is the single most likely time of year for airlines to add new, often seasonal, routes. The provided background information about a 'Promising Season' for Summer 2025 in Kurdistan supports this thesis, suggesting that airlines have likely already planned for increased demand. An increase of just two net routes is needed for a 'Yes' outcome. The combination of the low threshold for change (only two routes) and the high likelihood of seasonal additions leads me to believe a 'Yes' outcome is slightly more probable than not. My confidence is not higher because the timeframe is very short for route network changes, and any unforeseen regional instability or operational issues could easily lead to route cancellations, negating any gains. My forecast is not lower because ignoring the strong seasonal effect and the positive local reporting would be an oversight; adding a couple of summer routes to popular destinations like Antalya, Dubai, or a European city is a common and expected practice for an international airport. I would increase my forecast if specific new routes with start dates in June were announced, and I would decrease it if regional tensions escalate or a major carrier signals a reduction in service.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 31 direct flight destinations from Erbil, Iraq on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nShafaq News: [Kurdistan Summer 2025: A Promising Season](https://shafaq.com/en/Kurdistan/Kurdistan-Summer-2025-A-Promising-Season)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 31 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Erbil (EBL)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/EBL) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
