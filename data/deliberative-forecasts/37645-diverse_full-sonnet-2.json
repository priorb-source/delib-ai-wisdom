    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that cause me to reconsider my initial assessment. The most significant new argument is Forecaster 3's timing mechanics point: if elections are announced before July 1, they would be held in late July/August during summer holidays - historically uncommon timing in European democracies. This is a mechanical constraint I underweighted. Even if Vučić wanted snap elections, rational timing would delay the announcement until after summer, beyond our resolution date.\n\nBoth forecasters also emphasize more strongly than I did that forming a government in mid-April specifically to avoid elections, then reversing course 6-8 weeks later, would be a politically costly flip-flop signaling weakness and indecision.\n\nForecaster 2's framing of Vučić's 'within ten days' statements as political theater rather than genuine consideration is persuasive, especially since the previous such statement resulted in government formation, not elections.\n\nHowever, I'm slightly more concerned than they are about the May 14 timing. If Vučić is still publicly discussing 'going to the polls' after the April government formation, this suggests the option isn't completely off the table. While 12-15% may be appropriate, completely dismissing the possibility seems premature given Serbia's history of snap elections and ongoing public pressure.",
    "rationale": "The summer timing constraint is the strongest argument for moving my forecast down. Announcing elections now means voting in late July/August - poor timing that reduces the likelihood even if political will existed. Combined with the fresh government formation in April and officials' consistent messaging about stability, the status quo strongly favors no announcement.\n\nHowever, I'm weighing three factors that keep me from going as low as 12%: (1) Vučić's May 14 statement about deciding 'within ten days' on elections came after the government formation, suggesting continued fluidity, (2) Serbia has a track record of snap elections when leaders see tactical advantage, and (3) 59% public support for protests represents real pressure that could create an unexpected opening.\n\nThe mechanical timing argument is decisive though. Even if domestic politics shifted toward elections, rational scheduling would push any announcement past July 1 to avoid summer voting. This brings me closer to the other forecasters' range while maintaining slightly higher probability given the political uncertainty signals.",
