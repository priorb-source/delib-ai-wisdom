    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully anchors on company-level signals (Dole Q1: higher fruit and shipping costs, but better volumes). That supports cost-upward pressure while acknowledging potential offset from supply. I agree with their directional take and their caution given the tight threshold. Forecaster 3 contributes the most actionable new information: concrete recent BLS prints (62.1 in Jan, 62.5 in Mar) and a gentle upward drift that still lands May just below 63 absent new shocks. That is a material counter to my prior assumption that recent readings were \"at or above\" 0.63. Where I find F3 less convincing is in largely sidestepping potential April policy shocks (the reported 10% across-the-board tariff that would hit bananas), which, if real and passed through even partially, could add several cents per lb to retail quickly. F2 doesn’t address that tariff explicitly either. Given how close we are to the threshold, whether that tariff is real and how fast it’s passed through is pivotal. Net: I incorporate F3’s recent-levels argument (moving me up toward Yes) but keep meaningful weight on tariff/cost pass-through risks highlighted by F2’s cost backdrop.",
    "rationale": "Key updates from the deliberation: (1) Recent BLS levels cited by Forecaster 3 (Jan 62.1, Mar 62.5) imply a sub-63 baseline in early 2025 with slow month-to-month changes. If nothing new hit in April/May, May would likely print ~62.7–62.9, i.e., a Yes. (2) Company and industry commentary (Dole Q1, Quartz) and the research assistant’s note about a new 10% import tariff beginning April 5, 2025 create a clear upside risk. Even partial pass-through of a broad tariff could lift retail a couple of cents, pushing the reading ≥0.630. However, bananas are often a loss-leader; pass-through can be delayed or muted, and chain promotions at $0.59 are common.\nHow I’m reconciling: I assign material probability that the tariff exists and is at least partly passed through in May, but I also give real weight to the observed sub-63 recent prints and the structural stability of banana pricing. A simple blend: absent tariff/passthrough, I’d put P(under 0.630) around 65–75%. With tariff/passthrough, more like 25–35%. Weighting those scenarios leaves me near the mid-40s. With half the reference month already gone and no clear retail shock anecdotes, I lean a bit toward slower pass-through than full/immediate.\nWhat could move me: An April BLS banana price released on May 15 materially below 0.630 would push me up; evidence of broad 69–79¢ shelf pricing or confirmation of rapid tariff pass-through would push me down.",
