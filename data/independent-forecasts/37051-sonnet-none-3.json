    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following Trump's public threats, the IRS rapidly moves to revoke Harvard's 501(c)(3) status through emergency administrative action. Despite expected legal challenges, the revocation becomes official before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily weights the status quo outcome. Major universities like Harvard have maintained 501(c)(3) status for decades through various political controversies. Revoking such status would be unprecedented for an institution of Harvard's stature. The critical constraining factor is time: with only 67 days remaining, completing a legitimate revocation process is extremely unlikely. Standard IRS procedures for revoking tax-exempt status require formal review, documentation of violations, due process including notice and opportunity to respond, and typically take months or years to complete. While Trump has explicitly threatened Harvard's tax status according to the NYT article, presidential threats frequently don't materialize into concrete administrative action. Political rhetoric often differs from implementable policy. Any rushed attempt at revocation would face immediate legal challenges and likely court injunctions, especially if proper procedures weren't followed. The IRS, despite being part of the executive branch, traditionally operates with independence on tax determinations. Political pressure to revoke a major institution's status on such a compressed timeline would be legally questionable. My forecast is not lower (e.g., 1%) because we should acknowledge some tail risk in an unusual political environment where unprecedented actions are possible. It's not higher (e.g., 10%+) because the procedural, legal, and temporal barriers are formidable, and historical precedent strongly favors institutional continuity. To update higher, I would need evidence of: actual IRS initiation of revocation proceedings, explicit legal groundwork being laid, or credible reporting of imminent administrative action. To update lower, I would need time to pass without any concrete IRS action beyond rhetoric.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
