  "information": "Donald Trump's confirmed upcoming international travel includes the G7 Summit in Canada from June 16-18, 2025, and the NATO Summit in the Netherlands from June 24-25, 2025. Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to be in Central Asia for a summit in Kazakhstan from June 16-18, 2025. Historically, US presidential visits to China involve extensive logistical and security preparations, typically beginning weeks or months in advance. As of mid-June 2025, there have been no public reports of advance teams being dispatched or security preparations being made for a potential visit by Trump to China.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "15 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Donald Trump does not visit China, as no preparations for such a high-level visit have been made. He follows his publicly known schedule of attending the G7 and NATO summits, and the tight timeline and logistical requirements make a trip to China infeasible before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unforeseen and urgent global crisis necessitates an emergency, in-person meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping on Chinese soil, causing all standard protocols and logistical preparations to be drastically expedited or bypassed.",
    "rationale": "The primary basis for my forecast is the extreme logistical unlikelihood of a presidential visit to China being arranged and executed within the remaining 15-day window. As my research assistant noted, today is June 15, 2025. Presidential visits to a country like China are major undertakings requiring weeks, if not months, of advance logistical and security planning. There are currently no public reports of US advance teams or security preparations in China, which would be a necessary precursor to such a visit. Furthermore, Donald Trump's schedule is already filled with high-profile international engagements, including the G7 Summit in Canada (June 16-18) and the NATO Summit in the Netherlands (June 24-25). This leaves virtually no time for a trip to China. My probability is not zero because of the theoretical, albeit minuscule, possibility of a 'black swan' event or an unprecedented diplomatic gambit forcing an emergency meeting. However, the probability is not higher than 1% because the logistical and scheduling barriers are overwhelming, and the status quo of no planned visit is a very strong signal. I would raise my forecast only if there were credible reports of diplomatic preparations or a US advance team being dispatched to China. With each passing day without such news, my confidence in a 'No' outcome increases.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit China before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFox News: [Trump touts 'very positive' breakthrough with Xi after slamming China for trade violation](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-touts-very-positive-breakthrough-xi-after-slamming-china-trade-violation) | Wikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after this question opens and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits China.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDonald Trump's confirmed upcoming international travel includes the G7 Summit in Canada from June 16-18, 2025, and the NATO Summit in the Netherlands from June 24-25, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
