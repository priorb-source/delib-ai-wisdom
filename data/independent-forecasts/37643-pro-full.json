  "information": "An executive order signed on March 7, 2025, aims to limit eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program by altering the definition of 'public service'. The order directs the Department of Education and the Treasury Department to propose regulatory changes to make certain public-sector employees ineligible. Additionally, a provision within the House GOP's 2025 tax bill would grant the U.S. Treasury Secretary the authority to revoke the tax-exempt status of non-profits designated as 'terrorist supporting organizations,' which would disqualify their employees from the PSLF program.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education is establishing a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee, named the Student Loans and Affordability Committee, tasked with developing proposed regulations for federal student aid programs. A key focus of this committee will be to refine the definition of qualifying employers for Public Service Loan Forgiveness eligibility. The deadline for nominations for negotiators was June 1, 2025, and the committee is scheduled to hold its first session from June 30 to July 2, 2025, with proposed and final rules anticipated for release later in 2025.\n\nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is established by federal statute, specifically Section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act (codified at 20 U.S.C. §1087e(m)). Consequently, terminating the program is generally understood to require a new act of Congress. Unilateral executive action to end the program is considered to have uncertain legal standing and would require, at a minimum, a formal notice-of-proposed-rulemaking process, including a public comment period, before any changes could be finalized.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The objective is currently 'in progress', and if nothing changes, it will not be marked 'complete' by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The legislative and regulatory processes required to terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program are not completed by July 1, 2025. Executive actions may limit the program, but the spreadsheet maintainers do not consider this sufficient to mark the objective of 'terminating' the program as 'complete'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Congress rapidly passes and the President signs a new law that explicitly terminates the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program before July 1, 2025. The spreadsheet maintainers then update the objective's status to 'complete' in response to this definitive action.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is extremely low due to the high barrier for a 'Yes' resolution. The objective requires the *termination* of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program, which, as my research indicates, is established by federal statute and would require an Act of Congress to undo. The deadline of July 1, 2025, is less than two months away, an exceptionally short timeframe for passing such significant legislation. The current administrative actions mentioned, such as the March 7 executive order and the proposed rulemaking committee, are focused on *limiting* or *reforming* the program, not terminating it. The rulemaking committee's first meeting is scheduled for June 30, right at the deadline, confirming that this path will not lead to a 'complete' status in time. The status quo of 'in progress' is overwhelmingly likely to persist past the deadline. My forecast is not zero because there is a small, non-zero probability that the termination could be attached to unrelated, 'must-pass' legislation. I would increase my forecast upon seeing concrete evidence of such a legislative vehicle being prepared and advanced by Congressional leadership.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAn executive order signed on March 7, 2025, aims to limit eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program by altering the definition of 'public service'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
