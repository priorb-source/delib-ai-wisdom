    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ethiopia maintains its current travel advisory level, which is likely Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) rather than being upgraded to Level 4",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ethiopia's security situation remains relatively stable through June 2025. While there may be localized conflicts or civil unrest, these do not escalate to a level requiring the most severe travel advisory. The US Embassy continues operating normally, and there is no mass evacuation of American citizens or diplomatic personnel. Any incidents that occur are managed without triggering a full 'Do Not Travel' designation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major security crisis erupts in Ethiopia before July 1, 2025. This could include: a large-scale terrorist attack targeting Western interests or civilians, a full resumption of civil war with widespread violence threatening major cities including Addis Ababa, a complete breakdown of government authority, or circumstances requiring evacuation of US diplomatic staff. Such extreme deterioration would compel the State Department to issue its most severe Level 4 advisory.",
    "rationale": "Level 4 travel advisories are reserved for the most dangerous situations and are relatively uncommon - currently applied to countries like Afghanistan, Syria, and active war zones. Ethiopia has faced significant security challenges in recent years, including the Tigray conflict and various regional tensions, yet has not received a Level 4 designation during these crises. The reference to 'new travel warnings in 2025' suggests continued concern but does not necessarily indicate an imminent upgrade to Level 4.\n\nWith only 2 months remaining until the resolution date, the time window for a dramatic enough security deterioration to warrant Level 4 is limited. The State Department typically upgrades to Level 4 only when there is imminent danger to American citizens, inability to provide consular services, or recommendations for evacuation. While Ethiopia faces ongoing challenges, there is no indication in the available information of an imminent crisis of that magnitude.\n\nThe status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome, as the world changes slowly and Level 4 represents an extreme threshold. However, Ethiopia's history of instability and the possibility of rapid escalation prevent this from being near 0%. My forecast is not higher because there's no specific intelligence suggesting imminent crisis, and not lower because Ethiopia does face real security risks that could potentially escalate.\n\nI would update higher if: reports emerged of major troop movements, imminent attacks on Addis Ababa, orders to evacuate diplomatic personnel, or a sharp deterioration in regional conflicts. I would update lower if: peace negotiations progressed, security conditions demonstrably improved, or we moved closer to July 1 without escalation.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
