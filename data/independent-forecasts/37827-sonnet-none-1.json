    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days. June 2025 begins in 10 days (June 1) and the question resolves based on data accessed on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo suggests such reports are possible but rare. We have evidence of at least one pilot report from Africa (Rwanda on January 1, 2025), indicating that African pilots do occasionally report to NUFORC, but this appears to be an infrequent occurrence rather than a common pattern.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No pilots flying in African airspace during June 2025 observe unusual aerial phenomena, or if they do, they either don't recognize it as worth reporting, don't know about NUFORC, or report through local aviation authorities instead. Alternatively, any reports made are not processed and posted by NUFORC until after the resolution deadline, or are categorized in ways that don't clearly identify them as pilot reports.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial or private pilot operating in any of Africa's 54 countries observes an unidentified aerial phenomenon during June 2025. The pilot is aware of NUFORC (possibly through international pilot networks or online forums) and submits a report. NUFORC processes and posts this report in a timely manner, clearly identifying it as originating from a pilot and occurring in an African country during June 2025.",
    "rationale": "The January 2025 Rwanda example provides crucial proof-of-concept that African pilot reports to NUFORC do occur, establishing a non-zero baseline probability. However, several factors constrain the likelihood: (1) NUFORC is US-based, likely resulting in significant underreporting from African countries due to lower awareness, potential language barriers, and preference for local reporting mechanisms; (2) the requirement for specifically pilot reports (not general public sightings) is highly restrictive, as pilots represent a tiny fraction of observers; (3) the one-month window (June only) is narrow; (4) we lack data on the baseline rate of such reports from Africa. Working in favor of a Yes outcome: Africa has substantial commercial and private aviation activity across 54 countries, providing numerous opportunities for pilot observations; the short time horizon (June starts in 10 days) reduces uncertainty; modern pilots are generally well-connected internationally and may be aware of reporting platforms like NUFORC. My forecast is not higher because we're looking at the intersection of multiple specific conditions (African location AND pilot observer AND June timeframe AND reported to NUFORC), each of which narrows the probability. The single Rwanda example suggests these reports are rare rather than common. My forecast is not lower because the existence proof demonstrates feasibility, Africa's geographic and aviation scope is substantial, and one month provides reasonable opportunity for at least one qualifying report. I would revise upward if evidence emerged of multiple recent African pilot reports or increased reporting rates; I would revise downward if data showed the Rwanda case was extraordinarily unusual or if NUFORC coverage in Africa proved extremely limited.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
