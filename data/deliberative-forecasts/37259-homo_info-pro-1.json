    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from the other two forecasters. Forecaster 3's reasoning strongly aligns with my own initial assessment but sharpens the argument by quantifying the economic dependence on Denmark (~50% of budget) and, critically, by highlighting the complete absence of any current political discourse or maneuvering that would precede such a major announcement. This lack of 'smoke' is a powerful piece of negative evidence. Forecaster 2 introduces plausible catalysts for a 'Yes' outcome, such as a major foreign investment or a Danish political misstep, and correctly notes that heightened international interest increases volatility. However, their 15% forecast seems far too high given the short timeframe and their apparent use of information about the ruling party that contradicts the provided scenario, which weakens the foundation of their analysis.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 5% was based on the new government's explicit gradualist platform, its fresh electoral mandate for that approach, and the extremely short timeframe. The deliberation process has reinforced my conviction in this core analysis. I was particularly persuaded by Forecaster 3's argument regarding the lack of any preparatory political signals. A surprise referendum announcement is not just a policy change; it's a monumental political event that would almost certainly be preceded by leaks, internal party debates, and public trial balloons. The current silence on this front is deafening and makes a 'Yes' outcome even less likely than I first estimated. While Forecaster 2 correctly identifies potential catalysts, the probability of one of these catalysts occurring *and* prompting an immediate referendum announcement within the next eight weeks remains exceptionally low. The structural and political inertia is immense. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast slightly to reflect a higher confidence in the 'No' outcome, driven by the compelling evidence that no political groundwork is being laid. I am adjusting my forecast down by one percentage point, from 5% to 4%. The remaining 4% accounts for the small but non-zero possibility of a truly unexpected political shock forcing the government's hand.",
