    "review": "Both forecasters add useful, concrete signals I hadn’t incorporated: (1) the Istanbul June 2 track, with Peskov reportedly tying any Trump–Putin summit to its outcome, and (2) the White House not sending an official delegation—both pointing against rapid movement toward a June Moscow visit. Forecaster 3’s note on Trump’s recent critical rhetoric toward Putin and a stated “two-week observation” window also argues against an imminent conciliatory trip. Their emphasis on neutral venues, security/optics hurdles, and short lead times aligns with my priors. I find these arguments persuasive and better calibrated to the remaining time window than my earlier 8%.",
    "rationale": "Time left is about one month, and US presidential travel to Russia would almost certainly produce advance indicators. None are present. The new Istanbul-related information lowers the probability of the necessary diplomatic trigger: if a Russia-based summit is contingent on June 2 outcomes and the US isn’t even sending an official delegation, the path to a June-in-Russia meeting is narrow. Trump’s recent tougher rhetoric further reduces the odds of a near-term Moscow visit, and neutral territory remains far likelier for any rapid engagement. SPIEF (early June) and Russia Day (June 12) are plausible hooks, but the absence of credible leaks or logistical tells so close to those dates is telling. I’m keeping a small tail for an unconventional move if a breakthrough emerges, but I’m cutting from 8% to 4% based on these added constraints.",
