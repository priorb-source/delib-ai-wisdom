  "information": "According to reports from sources including The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Ars Technica in March 2025, Discord is planning an initial public offering (IPO) for 2025. The company is reportedly in discussions with investment banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase to prepare for a potential listing. While some sources describe the talks as exploratory, others mention the hiring of a new CEO with IPO experience as a signal of late-stage readiness. Discord's valuation was estimated at approximately $15 billion in 2021, and it has over 200 million monthly active users.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — there has been no public S-1 filing or specific IPO announcement on Discord’s news/blog so far.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discord targets a fall 2025 listing, keeps any SEC submission confidential, and makes no blog/news announcement before July 1; or market/operational considerations push the public S-1 to July/August.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Discord publicly files an S-1 in mid-to-late June, or posts on its news site that it has confidentially submitted an S-1 / is planning a 2025 IPO.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: Multiple March 2025 reports (NYT, Bloomberg, Ars Technica) indicate Discord is planning a 2025 IPO and has engaged JP Morgan and Goldman. Leadership moves with IPO experience were also reported. This supports a 2025 listing being seriously contemplated.\n- Resolution hinges on public signals: The question resolves Yes only if (a) a public SEC Form S-1 appears, or (b) Discord’s own news/blog carries a specific IPO-planning announcement. Confidential submissions alone don’t count unless Discord posts about them on its news page.\n- Timing dynamics: For a traditional fall IPO, companies typically keep filings confidential and only make the S-1 public 4–8 weeks before pricing. Given seasonality, many tech issuers avoid the mid-July–August lull and aim for September/October, implying a public S-1 in late summer rather than by July 1. If Discord is following that playbook, a pre–July 1 public S-1 is unlikely.\n- What would make a Yes before July 1? Either a deliberate early public S-1 in June, or a company news post acknowledging a confidential S-1 submission. Some firms do issue such notices, but many do not, which lowers the odds under this question’s specific resolution sources.\n- Why not higher: We’re late in May with no public S-1 yet; typical IPO cadence and summer market seasonality argue against a public filing before July 1. The resolution’s narrow sources exclude third-party media reports.\n- Why not lower: Credible reporting that a 2025 IPO is planned, banks reportedly engaged, and a receptive IPO window for high-profile consumer/AI-adjacent names leave a non-trivial chance Discord opts to file publicly in June or posts about a confidential submission.\n- Updaters: I would move up on credible reporting of an imminent public S-1 (e.g., auditor sign-off, final bank mandates, draft prospectus leaks), or if Discord posts any go-public language on its news/blog. I would move down if we see signals of timeline slippage (e.g., leadership changes, market volatility shutting the window, or chatter that they’re aiming squarely for fall with no near-term filing).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to reports from sources including The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Ars Technica in March 2025, Discord is planning an initial public offering (IPO) for 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
