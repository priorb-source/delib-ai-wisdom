    "no_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. legislative process proceeds at a normal pace, which is far too slow to pass a law terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program before July 1, 2025. The spreadsheet's status for this objective remains 'in progress' at the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In an unprecedented display of speed and political unity, a new administration and Congress, having taken office in January 2025, manage to draft, pass through both chambers, and sign into law a bill terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The spreadsheet editors subsequently mark the objective as 'complete' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is based almost entirely on the prohibitive timeline. As of May 14, 2025, there are less than two months until the resolution date. Terminating a major, established federal program like PSLF requires passing a new law. The standard U.S. legislative process—including committee hearings, debates, and votes in both the House and Senate, followed by presidential signature—is exceptionally slow and rarely completes in under two months, even for less controversial items. The status quo is 'in progress,' and the inertia of the legislative system is a powerful force that makes rapid change highly improbable. The probability is not higher because the timeline makes success a near-impossibility through normal legislative channels. The probability is not 0 because there is a minuscule chance of an extraordinary event, such as the provision being attached to a must-pass emergency bill that circumvents the standard process. I would raise my forecast significantly if a bill to terminate PSLF had already passed one house of Congress and was on the floor of the other for a vote. Without such progress, the probability of completion before July 1 is extremely low.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
