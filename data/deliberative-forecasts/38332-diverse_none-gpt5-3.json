    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully emphasizes the bilateral cost of snubbing Lula and the alignment between Orsi’s Frente Amplio and Brazil’s PT, plus Uruguay’s diversification incentive—points I had already weighed but they argue more forcefully. However, their 80% seems to underweight two things: (1) Uruguay’s instinct for hedging and optics around BRICS (not membership, but symbolism amid Russia’s presence), and (2) the resolution’s timing condition—governments can keep ambiguity and only confirm leader-level attendance very late, or opt for minister-level representation. Forecaster 3’s contribution sharpens the status quo/timing argument: with weeks left and no movement since March, inertia and caution matter. I think they somewhat overstate Uruguay as “pro-Western” rather than pragmatic non-aligned, and they may underweight that late-June confirmations are common. Net: F2 strengthens the case that a Yes remains plausible; F3 strengthens the case that timing and minister-level substitution keep this well below high odds.",
    "rationale": "No new hard signals have emerged. The balance remains: strong diplomatic incentive to accept Lula’s invite at head-of-state level (short trip, early-term visibility, alignment with Brazil and diversification goals) versus meaningful chances of (a) deferring to the foreign minister, or (b) delaying confirmation beyond July 1. The decision threshold for this market is the announcement by July 1, not eventual attendance, which keeps the base rate lower than a generic “will he attend?” question. Given we are in early June, a last‑minute late‑June confirmation is plausible, but not assured. Incorporating Forecaster 3’s timing/inertia point nudges me slightly downward from my prior 52%, while Forecaster 2’s diplomatic-cost argument prevents a larger drop. Overall this looks close to even odds with a slight tilt either way hard to justify without fresh reporting from Montevideo or Brasília (e.g., a published presidential agenda or Cancillería guidance). I’m trimming to an even 50% to reflect the genuine two-sided uncertainty and the minister-level representation risk.",
