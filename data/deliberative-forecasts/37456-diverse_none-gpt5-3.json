    "review": "Forecaster 2 persuasively argues that a chemical-adulteration recall by a large, capable firm like Cargill can be executed and verified within ~3 months; that’s consistent with some FSIS closures I’ve seen. However, their 75% feels high absent concrete signs of imminent closeout, especially given the requirement that the FSIS page must actually flip to Closed by July 1. Forecaster 3 rightly emphasizes base rates and that many FSIS recalls take 4–6 months to close, plus the risk of administrative lag. I find that caution credible and particularly relevant to this question’s resolution mechanics. Net, I’m more persuaded by Forecaster 3’s emphasis on closure-time base rates and page-update risk than by Forecaster 2’s optimistic timeline, though I still think Cargill’s scale and the nature of the hazard keep this above even odds.",
    "rationale": "Time window: about 55 days remain to reach a Closed status on the FSIS page, i.e., roughly 95 days from initiation. Base rates: FSIS recall closures often take several months; while some straightforward cases close in 2–3 months, many run 4–6 months or longer. Hazard: an unapproved cleaning solution in liquid egg product suggests a defined source and likely limited lot scope, with no illness reports—factors that can support faster resolution. Company: Cargill’s size and traceability systems are positives. Frictions: distribution to numerous foodservice customers can lengthen effectiveness checks, and even when operationally complete, FSIS website status changes can lag. The question’s strict criterion (page must show Closed before July 1) increases the bar. Balancing these, I trim my prior 62% downward on base-rate and admin-lag grounds, but keep it slightly above 50% because the product category, likely limited lots, and Cargill’s capabilities make a ~3-month close plausible. What would move me up: FSIS update noting completion of effectiveness checks or Cargill communication indicating recall closeout is imminent by mid-June. What would move me down: any recall expansion, signals of wide/complex distribution, or lack of any FSIS updates into late June.",
