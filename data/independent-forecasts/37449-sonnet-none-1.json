    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - The United States does not accuse China of blockading Taiwan",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China does not initiate any blockade of Taiwan's seaports. Cross-strait relations continue with current levels of tension, possibly including military exercises, but without any action that would constitute or be labeled as a blockade. The US therefore has no basis to make such an accusation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "China initiates a blockade of one or more Taiwanese seaports, perhaps in response to a triggering event (such as high-level US-Taiwan engagement, a Taiwanese independence declaration, or another crisis). The US government promptly and publicly accuses China of implementing an unauthorized blockade, using official State Department statements or presidential remarks.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires weighting several factors. The timeframe is very short - only about 8 weeks - and a Chinese blockade of Taiwan would represent an extraordinary escalation in cross-strait tensions with potentially catastrophic consequences, including possible military conflict with the United States. While the WSJ article referenced indicates China has developed blockade capabilities, capability does not equal intent or imminent action. The research assistant provided no additional information suggesting heightened immediate risk or unusual military movements. Historically, major geopolitical shifts of this magnitude are rare and typically preceded by clear warning signs. China has not blockaded Taiwan in modern history, and such an action would risk severe international sanctions and military response. The principle that 'the world changes slowly most of the time' strongly favors the status quo outcome. For this to resolve Yes, we would need: (1) China to make the policy decision to blockade, (2) actual implementation, (3) US public accusation, all within 8 weeks. This is not impossible - tensions in the Taiwan Strait are real and unpredictable incidents can escalate - which prevents an extremely low probability. However, absent specific intelligence or warning indicators, the base rate for such dramatic events is very low. I would revise upward with reports of unusual Chinese naval mobilization, major diplomatic crises, or actual interference with Taiwan shipping. I would revise downward as time passes uneventfully or with positive diplomatic developments.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of blockading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWSJ via MSN: [China Is Ready to Blockade Taiwan. Here’s How.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/china-is-ready-to-blockade-taiwan-here-s-how/ar-AA1BvnW8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of blockading at least one of Taiwan's seaports without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
