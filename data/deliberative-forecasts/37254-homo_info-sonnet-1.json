    "review": "The three analyses show strong convergence on fundamentals: all agree the status quo heavily favors No, Russia's military is stretched in Ukraine, the 2-month timeframe is short, and base rates for invasions are low. Forecaster 2 introduces specific intelligence about 150,000 Russian troops in Belarus conducting exercises, which is potentially significant given Russia's history of using exercises as cover for operations. However, I note several concerns: (1) My research assistant's report contained questionable claims about US voting patterns that contradict established policy, making me skeptical of unverified intelligence claims. (2) Even if the Belarus deployment is accurate, exercises near borders don't necessarily indicate invasion plans - Russia conducts military exercises regularly. (3) Forecaster 2 acknowledges Ukraine has strategic incentives to emphasize Russian threats. Both other forecasters appropriately emphasize Moldova/Transnistria as a concrete scenario, though even here there are no current indicators of imminent action. The narrow forecast range (4-6%) across all three forecasters suggests we've converged on the key considerations. Forecaster 3's independent arrival at 4% provides validation of this assessment.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I maintain my fundamental reasoning. The convergence around 4-6% reflects appropriate epistemic humility while recognizing the strong weight of evidence toward No. Key factors remain: (1) Russia's military commitment in Ukraine severely constrains capacity for new operations, (2) The 2-month window is extremely short for planning and executing a ground invasion, (3) No credible reports of military buildups on other borders beyond routine exercises, (4) Historical base rates for interstate invasions are low, (5) The enormous stakes of invading NATO members make that scenario nearly impossible. Forecaster 2's Belarus intelligence is interesting but doesn't fundamentally change the calculus - exercises happen regularly, and without signs of forces moving from exercise positions into attack formations, this doesn't indicate imminent invasion. Moldova remains the most plausible scenario given Transnistria, but even there I see no current indicators. The short timeframe is decisive - we're only 2 months from resolution, which is insufficient time for the kind of major military operation required. My 4% forecast already accounts for tail risks like unexpected crises or miscalculation.",
