    "review": "Both forecasters provided critical information I lacked. Forecaster 2's citation of the April 22, 2025 poll showing VHP at 29% projected seats versus NDP at 24% is game-changing evidence that directly addresses the question. This recent polling snapshot, showing VHP ahead just days before the election, substantially contradicts my heavy reliance on the ~3% approval rating. Forecaster 3's mention of Desi Bouterse's death creating a leadership crisis in the main opposition NDP is another crucial factor I missed - this fundamentally weakens the primary challenger and makes opposition consolidation far less likely. However, Forecaster 2 also notes extreme polling volatility (NDP at 54% in January, now 24%), which suggests the race remains fluid. I find Forecaster 2's rationale more compelling than Forecaster 3's because it appropriately weighs both the supportive polling data and the inherent uncertainties. Forecaster 3 at 72% seems to underweight the massive public dissatisfaction (56% dissatisfied, 66% say worse off) and polling volatility. The new proportional representation system adds uncertainty neither forecaster fully addressed.",
    "rationale": "I significantly underestimated VHP's probability by over-relying on the ~3% approval rating without recognizing: (1) presidential approval differs from party vote share, especially in fragmented multi-party systems where you can win plurality with modest support; (2) the April 22 poll showing VHP ahead in projected seats is direct, timely evidence favoring VHP; (3) Bouterse's death severely damages the main opposition NDP's organizational capacity and voter mobilization at a critical moment; (4) opposition fragmentation (NDP, NPS, ABOP, SDU coalition) makes it mathematically easier for VHP to win plurality even without majority support. However, I remain more cautious than Forecaster 3 because: the January-to-April polling swing (NDP: 54%→24%, a 30-point collapse) indicates high volatility and measurement uncertainty; the extreme public dissatisfaction metrics suggest genuine vulnerability; and with only 27 days remaining, negative sentiment could still crystallize into opposition voting. The latest poll is strong evidence but not definitive given the volatility and the untested new PR electoral system. I update significantly upward from 18% to 45%, splitting the difference between acknowledging the new favorable evidence while maintaining appropriate uncertainty given polling volatility and public discontent.",
