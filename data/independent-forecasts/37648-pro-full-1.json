  "information": "Ali Shamkhani, an advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader, has stated that Iran is ready to accept a new nuclear agreement with the United States in exchange for the immediate lifting of all economic sanctions. According to Shamkhani, Iran would commit to never producing nuclear weapons, eliminate its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and limit uranium enrichment to civilian levels under international oversight. Iran is currently enriching uranium to 60%. In a separate proposal presented during talks in Oman, Iran suggested the creation of a permanent joint nuclear enrichment company with regional Arab countries and American investors. Under this plan, Iran would continue to enrich uranium to a low level for civilian use and export it to other Arab nations, subject to increased international monitoring. Iranian officials have stated that the complete dismantlement of its nuclear program is a 'red line' but they are willing to cooperate to maintain their right to develop a peaceful civilian program.\n\nThe U.S. administration has outlined 14 non-negotiable 'red lines' for any new nuclear deal with Iran. These conditions include the complete removal of all of Iran's enriched uranium, the dismantling of its centrifuges, and the absence of any 'sunset clauses' that would allow restrictions to expire. President Trump has stated he is open to a deal to make the region safer, but his administration has also recently imposed new sanctions on Iran. Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the introduction of new sanctions during negotiations 'unacceptable.' Vice President J.D. Vance has publicly stated that Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon is 'completely off the table.' The U.S. negotiating position emphasizes the need for a 'strong agreement' with robust verification measures.\n\nSince April 2025, the United States and Iran have engaged in multiple rounds of indirect negotiations, mediated by Oman. The talks have been held in Muscat, Oman, and Rome, Italy, with the most recent fourth round taking place in Muscat on May 11. A fifth round of negotiations has been agreed upon. Both sides have described the discussions with terms such as 'constructive,' 'productive,' and 'difficult but useful,' with an Iranian official stating that the parties' positions have 'converged' and 'progress has been made.' In parallel, Iran is also scheduled to hold talks with the 'Euratrium'—the UK, France, and Germany—in Istanbul. The negotiations are proceeding under a deadline reportedly set by President Trump in March, which gave Iran two months to reach an agreement.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately six weeks, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No nuclear agreement is in place. The United States maintains comprehensive economic sanctions on Iran, while Iran continues to enrich uranium to high levels (60%), and regional tensions persist.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The negotiations collapse as the gap between the two sides' publicly stated 'red lines' proves insurmountable. The U.S. refuses to move from its demand for the complete dismantlement of Iran's enrichment infrastructure, while Iran refuses to relinquish its right to a civilian nuclear program. The talks end without a deal before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Intense Omani-mediated talks lead to a breakthrough. The U.S. and Iran announce an interim or limited agreement. Under this deal, Iran agrees to eliminate its stockpile of 60% enriched uranium and accept more intrusive international inspections in exchange for the U.S. providing specific sanctions relief, such as unfreezing assets or issuing waivers for oil sales.",
    "rationale": "While the status quo is 'no deal' and the publicly stated positions of the U.S. and Iran appear irreconcilable, recent evidence suggests there is significant momentum toward an agreement. The primary driver for this forecast is the high tempo of indirect negotiations since April 2025, with multiple rounds described as 'constructive' and reports that the parties' positions have 'converged.' Furthermore, the Israeli media report, citing senior ministerial sources assessing a 'high chance' of a deal, is a powerful indicator. Given Israel's typically hawkish stance and strong intelligence in the region, such an assessment implies that significant, non-public concessions are being made. Iran has also put forward concrete proposals, such as eliminating its highly-enriched uranium stockpile, indicating a serious approach to the talks. President Trump's reported two-month deadline, while creating pressure, also acts as a forcing function that makes a near-term resolution—either a deal or a definitive collapse—more likely than a continuation of the stalemate. The broad resolution criteria, requiring only an 'announcement' of 'an agreement,' allows for a limited, 'less-for-less' deal to resolve the question as 'Yes.' My probability is not higher because the gap between the public 'red lines' remains exceptionally wide. U.S. demands for complete dismantlement of centrifuges directly contradict Iran's insistence on maintaining a civilian program. The recent imposition of new U.S. sanctions during talks is a classic spoiler tactic that could still derail the process. My probability is not lower because the combination of frequent high-level engagement, positive diplomatic language, and the strong signal from Israeli intelligence outweighs the public posturing. This combination suggests the political will for a deal currently exists on both sides. I would increase my forecast if there were official reports of the U.S. softening its 'red lines.' I would decrease it if the upcoming fifth round of talks were to collapse without a follow-up date.",
