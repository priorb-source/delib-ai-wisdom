    "review": "All three analyses converge on the strong mathematical case for Yes. However, I made a critical calculation error that the other forecasters caught: there are 76 days from April 16 to July 1, not 46 as I stated. This significantly strengthens the case for Yes. Forecaster 3 correctly identifies the required rate as just 0.197 objectives/day - less than one-third of the recent observed rate of 0.625/day. Forecaster 2 makes the compelling point that to miss the threshold would require an unprecedented 11-fold slowdown from historical rates. Both forecasters' calculations are sound and their risk assessments align with mine. The spread of forecasts (80%, 85%, 89%) is relatively narrow, suggesting genuine convergence on the evidence. The main uncertainty isn't whether the mathematical trajectory supports Yes, but rather whether unforeseen disruptions or our 30-day data gap conceals important changes.",
    "rationale": "With the corrected timeline of 76 days (not 46), the mathematical case becomes even stronger. To reach 120 from a baseline of 105 requires only 0.197 objectives/day - dramatically less than the recent 0.625/day rate observed from April 8-16. Even with a 70% slowdown to 0.19 objectives/day, we'd barely miss the threshold. The 44 in-progress objectives provide substantial buffer. However, I'm moderating my upward adjustment because we now have precisely zero data from the past 30 days (April 16 to May 16). The tracker could theoretically already be at 120+ objectives, or it could have stalled completely. Without current data, significant uncertainty remains about what has happened in this recent period. Political developments, methodological changes, or reclassifications could have occurred. I'm updating upward to 87% based on the stronger mathematical case with the corrected timeline, but not moving to 90%+ due to the complete lack of recent data and the possibility of unforeseen disruptions. The threshold might already be met, but we simply don't know.",
