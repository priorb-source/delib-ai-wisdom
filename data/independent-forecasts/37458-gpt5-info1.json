  "information": "The last mutually acknowledged phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping took place on January 17, 2025. Since then, Trump has claimed to have spoken with Xi on multiple occasions, but China's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly and publicly denied that any leader-to-leader calls have occurred. On May 5, 2025, President Trump stated he had 'no immediate plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping.' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakum reiterated that 'the two heads of state have not called each other recently' and that no negotiations on tariffs are underway.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (resolution deadline June 15, 2025; eligible call window May 12–June 14 local dates)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No leader-to-leader call occurs in the window, or only one side claims a call while the other denies or stays silent; or any call happens before May 12 or after June 14; or they meet in person rather than speaking by phone.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Escalating tariff or security tensions prompt a managed de-escalation step: lower-level talks make progress, and both sides agree to—and publicly acknowledge—a leader call with brief readouts emphasizing their positions, possibly timed before mid-June diplomatic milestones.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/status quo: The research assistant reports the last mutually acknowledged call was Jan 17, 2025. Since then, Trump has claimed multiple calls while China’s Foreign Ministry has publicly denied any leader-to-leader calls. On May 5, Trump said he had no immediate plans to speak with Xi; the MFA reiterated there have been no recent calls and no tariff negotiations. This establishes a status quo of no acknowledged calls and a Chinese communications posture of denial. The baseline outcome if nothing changes is therefore No.\n- Window/tempo: The eligible window is short (about one month). Leader calls can be arranged quickly, but typically follow groundwork or a specific catalyst.\n- Constraints: The resolution requires both sides to acknowledge the call. Given recent Chinese denials, even if informal contact occurred, a lack of PRC acknowledgment would still resolve as No. This lowers the odds materially versus the chance of any contact.\n- Drivers for Yes (why not lower): Sudden economic/market stress, tariff deadlines, or progress in lower-level talks could trigger a mutually acknowledged leader call as a signaling device. Such calls are not rare in US–China crisis management, and can be organized on short notice.\n- Drivers for No (why not higher): Current public stances (no plans; PRC denials; no negotiations underway) and the short window argue against near-term change. Beijing may avoid acknowledging a call to resist the optics of negotiating under pressure. Also, a planned leader encounter is unlikely within the window, and the question requires a phone call specifically.\n- Updating cues:\n  • Upward: Credible reports of scheduled high-level economic/security talks; a White House or MFA notice of a planned leader call; market-moving tariff headlines indicating imminent negotiation; coordinated readouts after a senior envoy’s visit.\n  • Downward: Fresh PRC denials paired with new tariff escalations; reports that communication is confined to working-level channels; continued insistence by either side that no leader call is planned.\nTaking these into account, I assign modest odds to a mutually acknowledged call in the narrow window, with the status quo favoring No but allowing for a crisis-management or negotiation-driven exception.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs. China has denied talks are taking place](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-xi-china-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe last mutually acknowledged phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping took place on January 17, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
