    "review": "Both forecasters present well-structured arguments that closely mirror my own: strong headwinds (no bill on the TNLA docket, limited sitting days, acute political/fiscal distractions, and the extra step of depositing the instrument) versus modest tailwinds (public advocacy, regional momentum, and potential for executive fast-tracking). They emphasize the possibility of a symbolic, low-cost ratification push and identify concrete indicators that would move the odds. I don’t see new hard evidence beyond what I’d considered; their points about expedited executive action are valid but already in my prior. No additional signals (e.g., cabinet memo, order paper listing, AU deposit prep) were introduced to justify a higher probability.",
    "rationale": "My baseline remains that the status quo favors No within the ~60-day window. Key constraints persist: the AfCFTA ratification bill is not visible on the TNLA calendar for May–June, the legislature’s capacity and cadence are low, and the government is managing simultaneous crises (oil revenue collapse, peace/election timelines, recent high-level arrests). Even if the executive prioritizes ratification, executing the full chain—tabling, readings/committee, passage, assent, and drafting/depositing instruments—on this timeline is atypical for South Sudan. The tailwinds (Trade Ministry and business community advocacy, EAC engagement, and continental pressure) keep the probability above near-zero, since a fast-track is conceivable and deposit can, in principle, follow quickly if prepped in parallel. However, absent concrete movement (official tabling, cabinet clearance, TNLA scheduling, or evidence of instrument preparation), I maintain a slightly below-peers stance. I would move up meaningfully upon credible signs of TNLA action or MOFA/Justice drafting for deposit; I would move down if we reach early June without the bill on the order paper or if TNLA adjourns/redirects to other priorities.",
