  "information": "The US government documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024. A notable concentration of these incidents occurred in Arizona, which has become a hotspot for sightings, particularly involving military aircraft. On January 19, 2023, a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet was hit by an object described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system' over Arizona, damaging the plane's canopy. This was one of 22 UFO sightings reported by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. Some US officials have suggested that the mysterious objects could be advanced drones used by foreign drug cartels for surveillance and smuggling operations.\n\nAccording to news reports, Florida ranks among the top three US states for total UFO sightings, with 8,623 reported cases documented by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). On March 28, 2025, a US military aircraft encountered a large group of unidentified objects described as glowing spheres in the sky over Florida. A leaked audio recording of the pilot's radio conversation with an air traffic controller indicated the pilot saw several high-speed objects, experienced communication disruptions, and observed an unusual glow around the plane. A Lockheed AC-130 Spectre gunship was reportedly dispatched to the area in response to the incident.\n\nData from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) indicates that California has the most reported UFO sightings in the US, with 36,286 sightings since 1974. Following California in total sightings are Washington, Florida, Oregon, and New York. NUFORC's public archive shows approximately 100-150 pilot-flagged reports are logged nationwide in a typical year, which averages 8-12 per month. The distribution of these pilot reports is skewed, with California and Florida being the two most common states for such reports, followed by a tier including Arizona, Texas, and Washington. In March 2025, a US Air Force pilot in California reported seeing 'three orange-like lights' hovering above Los Angeles.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known on or after July 1, 2025, when Metaculus accesses the NUFORC data for June 2025. This is approximately 41 days from today (May 21, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on historical data, California would be the most likely state to have the most pilot UFO reports in June 2025, as it has the highest total UFO sightings (36,286) and shares top billing with Florida for pilot-specific reports. The status quo suggests California narrowly edges out Florida for most pilot sightings in any given month.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "California maintains its historical pattern and records more pilot sightings than Florida in June 2025. Alternatively, another high-activity state like Arizona, Texas, or Washington experiences an unusual cluster of pilot reports that month, surpassing Florida. Even a tie between Florida and any other state would result in a No outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Florida experiences a higher-than-average concentration of pilot sightings in June 2025, building on recent activity like the March 28, 2025 incident. Random variation in the small monthly sample size (8-12 pilot reports nationwide) favors Florida, or a notable June incident in Florida airspace generates multiple pilot reports while other states have quieter months.",
    "rationale": "This forecast involves very small sample sizes with high variance. With only 8-12 pilot reports nationwide per month, each state's monthly count is typically 0-2 reports, with occasional months reaching 3-4. Historical data shows California and Florida are the two leading states for pilot reports, but California has significantly higher overall UFO sightings (36,286 vs 8,623), suggesting a baseline advantage. The March 2025 Florida incident demonstrates recent activity in the state, but this doesn't necessarily predict June patterns. The key challenge is that Florida must have MORE pilot sightings than ALL other states - ties result in No, which raises the bar. Given the high variance, Florida has a meaningful but not dominant chance. The status quo (California leading or tied) should carry substantial weight. If Florida were consistently #1 in pilot reports, I'd forecast higher (40-50%), but the data suggests rough parity with California. If this were any-state-in-top-3, I'd forecast much higher (60-70%). The specific requirement to be #1 outright, combined with California's volume advantage, keeps the probability modest at 25%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe US government documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
