    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 24 days (deadline: before July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Morgan continues signaling interest and building a team but opts to wait for a later, splashier rollout (e.g., July or later) or ultimately decides not to run.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Morgan releases a video or holds a press conference in June announcing his candidacy, possibly to preempt other Democrats or capitalize on recent media attention.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and timing: With roughly three weeks left, the default outcome is No—most potential candidates who are still “considering” by early June for a 2026 race tend to delay announcements into later summer or fall. Campaigns often prefer clean reporting periods and more prep time for staffing, endorsements, and launch events.\n- Evidence available: The Politico piece (May 15) described a serious exploration and a blueprint, which raises the chance above a pure base rate. But our research assistant found no additional concrete signals (no dated event venue bookings, no filing, no staff announcements, no teased launch window), which keeps the probability restrained.\n- Morgan-specific factors: He has a history of public deliberation and past flirtations with runs that did not materialize. That history pushes toward No in the near term. Countervailing factors include his wealth and ability to move quickly and independently of traditional party machinery; if he wants to seize a media window, he can announce with little lead time.\n- Why not higher: The window is short; absent fresh, credible reporting of an imminent launch, the status quo (no announcement yet) dominates. Additionally, many candidates time launches for maximum impact and might prefer early July or later rather than late June.\n- Why not lower: The recent detailed Politico reporting suggests genuine intent exploration, and he has the resources to move fast. A sudden June video announcement is plausible.\n- What would move me up: Confirmed reports of a scheduled June launch event, formal filings, staff hires with June start dates, venue holds, or public statements from Morgan (or top Florida Democrats) indicating a June decision/announcement.\n- What would move me down: Credible reporting that he’s delaying the decision until July or later, public statements hinting at a longer timeline, or the emergence of another consensus Democratic candidate that Morgan signals he’ll support.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information beyond the Politico article—hence the forecast leans heavily on timing norms and Morgan’s track record.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill John Morgan announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [John Morgan lays out campaign blueprint for possible Florida governor run](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/15/john-morgan-florida-governor-run-00351005)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if John Morgan announces his candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
