  "information": "The White House has officially confirmed that President Donald Trump will attend the G7 summit in Canada from June 15-17, 2025. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that details of the visit would be announced shortly. Numerous media outlets reported the confirmation in late May 2025, and official G7 participant lists dated June 3 include Trump.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12–14 days; observable June 15–17, 2025 when the summit occurs.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Trump attends in person as planned.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A last-minute cancellation or nonattendance driven by an acute health issue, a major domestic or international crisis that keeps him in Washington, an immovable legal/court obligation he opts not to defer, a significant security or aviation disruption, or the summit being postponed/cancelled or converted away from in-person meetings in June 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump travels to Canada and is physically present at at least one G7 session or bilateral during June 15–17, 2025, directly seeing and hearing other leaders; even brief in-person presence satisfies the criterion.",
    "rationale": "The White House has officially confirmed President Trump’s attendance for the June 15–17 G7 in Canada; press statements and multiple media reports in late May corroborate this, and current official participant lists (dated June 3) include him. With travel to a close ally on a short-haul trip and the event less than two weeks away, the status quo strongly favors attendance. Historically, U.S. presidents almost always attend G7 summits in person unless extraordinary circumstances intervene (e.g., pandemic-era disruptions). Even if he were to depart early, any in-person presence would resolve this as Yes. Reasons this is not even higher than it is: residual tail risks remain—sudden health issues, an unexpected domestic or international crisis, a security incident affecting the venue or travel, or an unforeseen legal scheduling conflict he chooses not to waive. Reasons it is not lower: formal White House confirmation, inclusion on official lists, the high diplomatic salience of G7, and the short time horizon reduce uncertainty. I would update upward upon seeing firmed logistics (e.g., publicly released schedule, advance team/pool reports of wheels up), and day-of travel confirmation. I would update downward on credible reports of a health setback, an urgent domestic/international emergency, changes to the summit format/timing, or an official statement altering his travel plans.",
