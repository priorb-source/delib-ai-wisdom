  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks (late June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — US presidents almost always attend NATO Summits, and Trump attended all NATO summits in his first term.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump skips and sends the Vice President or Secretary of State; a domestic or international crisis keeps him in Washington; a late health issue; the summit is postponed out of June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump travels to The Hague, attends at least one leaders’ session or photo-op, possibly leaves early after delivering burden‑sharing messages.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: Modern US presidents virtually always attend NATO summits. Trump himself attended the 2017, 2018, and 2019 leaders’ meetings in person. With only weeks to go, the default is attendance. Incentives: Attending gives Trump leverage to pressure allies on 2%+ defense spending, stage-setting for US policy on Ukraine, and a high-visibility platform. Costs of skipping would be diplomatically significant and newsworthy. Countervailing risks: Trump’s skepticism toward NATO, his willingness to break norms, potential desire to signal toughness by downgrading multilateral forums, and non-trivial tail risks (health, security, domestic crisis). Also, if the summit were moved out of June, this question would resolve No under its criteria. With no fresh, specific reporting (the research assistant found no additional info), I overweight the historical pattern and Trump’s own prior behavior but haircut for idiosyncratic unpredictability and short-notice changes. Why not higher: Trump’s unique propensity to skip or truncate multilateral events, plus possible scheduling/legal or crisis-driven disruptions. Why not lower: Strong base rates, high stakes, and his past attendance record. Upward updates: Official White House travel guidance naming the summit, NATO listing him among confirmed attendees, pooled press logistics for a presidential bilateral schedule at the summit. Downward updates: Credible reports he will send a surrogate, indications of a boycott/leveraging tactic, acute domestic crisis, or news that the summit is postponed beyond June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the NATO Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Netherlands to host 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_225618.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a NATO summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the NATO Summit such that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
