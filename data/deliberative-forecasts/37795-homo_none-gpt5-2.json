    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short horizon (~4 weeks), the clustering of several bottom-tier teams, and the lack of current-standings data, all of which argue against a high probability. Forecaster 2’s conditional thresholds (how far the Rockies are from last) are useful and align with how I’d update if we had standings. Forecaster 3’s base-rate framing is helpful, though I think 13% is on the low side unless there’s evidence another team is already significantly worse. The point about ties likely counting is important and nudges the probability up slightly. Overall, their reasoning is sound and largely consistent with my initial view, but it makes me modestly more conservative absent current standings.",
    "rationale": "We are 27 days out. Without current standings, priors dominate: the Rockies project as bottom-tier but face competition from several similarly weak teams (White Sox, A’s, Marlins, possibly Angels/Nationals). Over a ~20–25 game window, a 3–5 game swing can shuffle the bottom, and the chance any one team is in sole possession of last on a specific date is modest unless they already have a clear deficit. The NL West context slightly raises downside risk, but not enough to make them a favorite against the field of other weak teams. I previously set 25% to reflect bottom-tier true talent plus short-horizon volatility and the possibility that ties count. After considering the others’ arguments—particularly the dilution across 4–6 plausible cellar teams and the likely presence of at least one equally bad club—I’m shading down slightly to better reflect the status-quo “another team is currently worst” assumption. My estimate assumes ties for lowest winning percentage count; if ties did not count, I’d drop ~2–3 points.",
