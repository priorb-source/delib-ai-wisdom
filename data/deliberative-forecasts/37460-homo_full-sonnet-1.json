    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a crucial point I initially underweighted: despite massive protests apparently occurring in March and May 2025, the question criteria have not yet been satisfied as of May 7. This is genuinely puzzling if protests with hundreds of thousands (or millions) of participants have already occurred. This suggests either: (1) the protest size estimates are less reliable than news reports indicate, (2) the Global Protest Tracker has specific inclusion criteria or verification processes that exclude these events, (3) significant reporting lag exists, or (4) the tracker may have coverage gaps for Turkey. Forecaster 3 and I both arrived at 82% using similar reasoning, focusing on the clear evidence of large protests and ongoing political tensions. However, we may have been too quick to assume the tracker will report these events. The fact that they haven't been reported yet despite their apparent scale is a red flag that deserves more weight. The May 1 authorized marches (65,000 combined) are better documented with official numbers from the Istanbul Governor's Office, but even these haven't appeared in the tracker yet. The earlier March protests rely more on news reports and CHP claims, which may be harder to verify or may not meet the tracker's standards. That said, 55 days remain, continued protests are planned, and the political/economic conditions (48.6% inflation, opposition arrests) strongly favor continued large-scale mobilization.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating downward based on Forecaster 2's observation about the puzzling absence of tracker reporting despite apparently massive protests. This introduces significant uncertainty about either the reliability of reported protest sizes or the tracker's coverage practices. However, I'm not going as low as 72% because: (1) multiple independent news sources reported the protests, not just partisan claims, (2) the May 1 numbers from official sources confirm capacity for 10,000+ gatherings, (3) 55 days provides substantial opportunity for either delayed reporting or new large protests, (4) the underlying drivers remain strong with CHP explicitly planning continued action. The question hinges on whether the tracker will report - either on past events or future ones. The absence of reporting so far suggests higher uncertainty about their methodology, but the scale of events and time remaining still favor a Yes outcome more likely than not.",
