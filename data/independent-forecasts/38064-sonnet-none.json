    "no_outcome_scenario": "GameStop schedules their 2025 annual meeting for a different date (earlier or later than June 12), or the meeting begins on June 12 but does not fully complete due to technical issues similar to the 2024 server crash, or the meeting is postponed or rescheduled.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GameStop schedules their 2025 annual meeting for June 12, 2025, all stakeholders are properly notified, and the meeting runs from start to finish without any interruptions, technical failures, or postponements that would prevent its completion.",
    "rationale": "The 2024 annual meeting occurred on June 13, 2024, so June 12, 2025 would represent similar seasonal timing (mid-June). Companies typically maintain consistent timing for annual meetings year-over-year. However, several factors weigh against this outcome: (1) The research assistant found no additional information confirming the June 12 date, which is concerning given we're only 16 days away - annual meetings are typically announced 30-60+ days in advance through proxy materials and SEC filings. (2) The resolution criteria are strict - the meeting must fully complete, not just begin. The 2024 precedent of server crashes adds risk even if the date is correct. (3) Without confirmation of the specific date, the prior probability of any single date being correct is inherently low. The forecast is not higher because there's no concrete evidence the meeting is scheduled for June 12 specifically, and the complete-or-fail criterion adds execution risk. The forecast is not lower because June 12 is plausibly close to the 2024 date (June 13), making it a reasonable candidate date. To update higher, I would need: announcements of the June 12 date in proxy materials, SEC Form DEF 14A filings, or official company communications. To update lower, I would need: confirmation of a different date, or indications of scheduling delays.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Gamestop annual meeting take place on June 12, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNBC (2024): [Servers for GameStop annual shareholder meeting crash due to overwhelming interest](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/gamestop-annual-shareholder-meeting-2024-servers-crash.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Gamestop's 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is held on June 12, 2025.\n\nThe meeting is considered to have been held when it fully completed. For example, if the meeting begins but is then postponed due to server issues, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
