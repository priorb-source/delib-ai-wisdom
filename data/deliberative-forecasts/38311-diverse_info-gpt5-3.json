    "review": "Forecaster 2 contributes concrete host-side signals (restricted airspace, controlled access zones, US advance presence in Banff) and highlights the 50-year unbroken precedent of US presidents attending in person—both are strong, incremental confirmations beyond mere press statements. I hadn’t explicitly weighed the historical continuity that heavily. I note a minor correction: we are ~12 days from the summit (June 15–17), not 7, which leaves slightly more tail risk than stated. Forecaster 3 adds a timely bilateral (Trump–Scholz on June 5) as evidence of ongoing engagement and no boycott intent—useful and directionally supportive. Their mention of policy frictions is real but unlikely to override the strong institutional and logistical momentum. Overall, both analyses reinforce high odds; none presents a compelling new downside risk.",
    "rationale": "Baseline was already high on the strength of White House confirmation and Trump’s inclusion on official participant lists as of June 3. Additional corroboration—host-country security posture and US advance planning, plus the imminent Scholz meeting—further reduces the chance of a voluntary no-show. Any in-person appearance, even brief or with an early departure, resolves Yes, which also raises odds. I’m not higher than mid-90s because there remains roughly a 12-day window for low-probability disruptions (acute health issue, major domestic/international crisis, significant security incident, or an abrupt scheduling reversal). Trump’s propensity for late changes preserves a small tail. I would move to 98–99% upon credible reports of wheels up/arrival or formalized day-by-day schedule releases with pooled press/advance confirmations. I would drop meaningfully only on credible reports of a cancellation, a major emergent crisis, or a material change to the summit format/timing.",
