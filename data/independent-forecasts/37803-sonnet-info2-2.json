  "information": "Specific actions have been taken to dismantle climate-related military programs. The U.S. Navy officially rescinded its 'Climate Action 2030' plan, a Biden-era initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Navy Secretary John Phelan announced the decision, emphasizing a renewed focus on \"lethality and our warfighters.\" Furthermore, the Department of Defense has removed $377 million in funding for climate change reduction programs. Other initiatives, such as the Air Force's 'Sustainable Aviation Fuel' program and the Army's plan for tactical vehicle electrification, have also been put in doubt or deemed impractical.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "42 days from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The website remains offline (No outcome). The site has been down since at least May 5, 2025 and shows no signs of being restored.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration maintains its current policy trajectory of dismantling climate-related military programs. The climate.mil portal remains offline as it is deemed inconsistent with the administration's priorities emphasizing 'lethality and warfighters' over climate resilience planning. No technical restoration or policy reversal occurs in the 42-day window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The site could come back online if: (1) the outage was partly technical and gets resolved by career staff, (2) operational military needs for climate resilience planning override political preferences, (3) congressional or legal pressure forces restoration, (4) the administration decides to restore climate information under different framing (e.g., 'operational readiness' rather than 'climate action'), or (5) bureaucratic momentum leads to restoration by officials unaware of or resistant to the broader policy shift.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors the site remaining offline. The timing of the outage coincides precisely with documented actions to dismantle military climate programs: the Navy rescinded its Climate Action 2030 plan, DOD removed $377M in climate funding, and The Guardian reported systematic purging of climate content from federal websites. This appears to be deliberate policy, not technical malfunction. Secretary Phelan's explicit emphasis on 'lethality' over climate concerns signals ideological commitment to this direction. However, I'm not forecasting lower than 13% because: (1) 42 days provides time for unexpected developments, (2) military bases face genuine climate-related operational challenges that may require some form of planning portal, (3) career military staff might restore functionality for operational reasons, (4) we lack complete visibility into internal deliberations or potential legal/congressional pressures. I'm not forecasting higher because there's no evidence of pushback forcing restoration, the administration has taken multiple concrete dismantling actions, and the policy direction appears firmly set. To update higher, I'd need evidence of restoration efforts, court orders, or operational crises requiring climate planning. To update lower, I'd need confirmation the site is permanently decommissioned or more aggressive purging actions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US military's climate resiliance portal be back online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Guardian [Scientists brace ‘for the worst’ as Trump purges climate mentions from websites](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-climate-change-federal-websites)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
