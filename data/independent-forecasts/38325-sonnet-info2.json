  "information": "Historical analyses of BEA data by the St. Louis Fed show that revisions which change the sign of GDP growth from negative to positive are uncommon, happening in less than 20% of such cases. Another analysis covering the period from 1996 to 2024 indicates that when an advance estimate is between -0.5% and 0%, the third estimate turns positive in roughly 35-40% of instances. The typical absolute revision from the second to the third estimate is about 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points, while the absolute average revision from the advance to the third estimate is larger, at approximately 0.5 percentage points.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks. The third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP is typically released around 90 days after quarter end, which would be late June 2025. Given today is June 5, 2025, the release should occur around June 26-30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The third estimate confirms that Q1 2025 real GDP contracted, showing negative or zero growth, consistent with the advance estimate of -0.3% annualized decline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The third estimate maintains or further confirms the economic contraction indicated by the advance estimate. Additional data on consumer spending, business investment, or trade deficits validates the negative growth reading. The -0.3% advance estimate is revised to somewhere between -0.5% and +0.0%, failing to cross the threshold into positive territory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Revisions to key GDP components—particularly inventory investment, net exports, or personal consumption expenditures—lead the BEA to revise Q1 GDP upward by more than 0.3 percentage points. The third estimate shows positive annualized growth, even if modest (e.g., +0.1% to +0.5%), indicating the economy actually expanded rather than contracted in Q1 2025.",
    "rationale": "The advance estimate showed -0.3% annualized growth, placing it in a critical zone where revisions could plausibly reverse the sign. My research assistant's analysis provides crucial context: when advance estimates fall between -0.5% and 0%, the third estimate turns positive in approximately 35-40% of cases. This is notably higher than the general <20% rate for negative-to-positive sign reversals, suggesting the specific magnitude matters. The typical absolute revision from advance to third estimate (~0.5 percentage points) exceeds the 0.3 pp gap needed to turn positive, making a reversal mechanically feasible. However, I must also weight the status quo heavily—the world changes slowly, and economic data revisions, while frequent, rarely change fundamental narratives. The -0.3% reading, though small, was still negative, and most revisions tend to confirm rather than reverse initial readings. My forecast is not higher because: (1) sign reversals remain generally uncommon; (2) we haven't seen the second estimate yet, which typically provides a better signal; (3) the advance estimate being negative creates a prior that suggests genuine economic weakness. My forecast is not lower because: (1) the historical data for this specific range is quite clear at 35-40%; (2) the revision magnitude needed is well within typical bounds; (3) the -0.3% figure is close enough to zero that measurement error alone could account for a reversal. I would update upward if the second estimate (which should be available now or very soon) revised closer to zero or positive. I would update downward if the second estimate confirmed or deepened the contraction, or if additional economic data suggested genuine Q1 weakness.",
