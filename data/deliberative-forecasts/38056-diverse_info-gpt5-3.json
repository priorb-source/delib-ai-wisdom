    "review": "Both forecasters introduced decisive new information I hadn’t incorporated: multiple reports that Johnny Walker withdrew from UFC 316 and that Brendson Ribeiro has been officially booked as Murzakanov’s replacement. Their argument that re-adding Walker after a replacement is signed and promoted is extraordinarily rare is compelling and aligns with UFC norms. Given the resolution criteria, this makes a Yes outcome extremely unlikely.",
    "rationale": "My prior estimate assumed the bout was intact and modeled Walker as a live underdog conditional on the fight happening. With Walker reportedly withdrawn and a replacement bout (Murzakanov vs. Ribeiro) announced, the path to Yes now requires two unlikely steps: (1) a reversal that restores Walker vs. Murzakanov at UFC 316 despite a replacement already signed and promoted, and (2) Walker then defeating Murzakanov. Even if Walker’s win probability in that hypothetical were ~35%, the probability of the reversal itself appears well under a few percent. Multiplying yields a sub-1% overall chance. I’m leaving a sliver for extremely unusual last-minute changes (e.g., replacement falls out and Walker is surprisingly cleared and reinserted), but this is highly improbable. Accordingly, I am updating sharply downward from 32% to 1%.",
