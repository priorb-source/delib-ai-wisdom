    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days (from June 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Casey DeSantis has not announced her candidacy yet, and without an announcement by now, the default expectation is that one will not occur in the remaining time",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis does not announce her candidacy before July 1, 2025, either because she has decided not to run for Florida governor or because she plans to announce after the deadline",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis announces her candidacy for Florida governor sometime in the next 26 days. This could happen through a formal campaign announcement event, press release, or social media declaration",
    "rationale": "With only 26 days remaining until the deadline, the status quo strongly favors a No resolution. Several factors support this: (1) The research assistant reports no additional information about an imminent announcement, which is significant - if an announcement were planned for the next 26 days, there would typically be media reports, campaign staff movements, or other signals. (2) The provided poll shows Byron Donalds has Trump's endorsement and is leading, which may have discouraged Casey DeSantis from entering the race. (3) Political campaign announcements are rarely spontaneous; they typically involve weeks of preparation, staff hiring, fundraising setup, and media coordination. The absence of any such signals this close to the deadline is telling. (4) Good forecasting practice emphasizes status quo bias - the world changes slowly, and without clear catalysts, things tend to remain as they are. That said, I cannot assign an extremely low probability because: (1) 26 days is still a meaningful time window where an announcement could technically occur, (2) surprise announcements do sometimes happen in politics, and (3) we lack explicit information confirming she has ruled out running. For me to update higher, I would need reports of campaign preparation, staffing announcements, fundraising activity, or statements from Casey DeSantis or her allies suggesting an announcement is coming. To update lower, I would need explicit statements ruling out a run or reports that she is backing another candidate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Casey DeSantis announce her candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Poll: Trump's endorsement boosts Byron Donalds over Casey DeSantis for Florida governor](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/05/09/poll-byron-donalds-surges-past-casey-desantis-with-trump-backing/83412367007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Casey DeSantis announces her candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
