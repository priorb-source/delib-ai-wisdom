  "information": "Colombia has declared a national health emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, there have been 79 reported cases and 36 deaths since 2024, with the departments of Tolima and Putumayo being the most affected. The government has implemented mobility restrictions in high-risk areas and vaccination requirements for travelers. In response to rising cases in South America, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a level 2 travel notice for the continent, citing spread to newly affected areas in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. There are currently no CDC travel health notices for yellow fever outbreaks in any North American country. Standing recommendations for vaccination exist for travel to endemic zones in some countries, but these are distinct from outbreak-related notices.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The yellow fever outbreak in South America is successfully contained or does not spread northward. Surveillance and vector control in at-risk North American countries prevent the establishment of local transmission, and no CDC advisory is issued by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The virus is carried by a traveler from an affected South American country into Central America or the Caribbean. This leads to a small cluster of locally transmitted cases, which is detected by health authorities and results in the CDC issuing a new Travel Health Notice for that country.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo, as large-scale disease dynamics change relatively slowly. Currently, no North American country has a CDC yellow fever advisory, and such advisories for the region are historically rare. The active outbreak is in South America, and while concerning, there are significant natural and public health barriers to its spread into North America. The primary risk factor is an infected traveler initiating local transmission in a region with the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector. However, the timeline of approximately five weeks is very short for this entire sequence—viral introduction, transmission, detection, and administrative action by the CDC—to unfold. The probability is not lower because the ongoing, severe outbreak in South America, as noted in the PAHO alert, creates a tangible, non-zero risk of spread. I would increase my forecast significantly upon reports of confirmed local transmission in Panama, Costa Rica, or southern Mexico. I would decrease it if reports indicate the South American outbreak is being successfully contained.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country in North America is listed as having a travel advisory by the Centers for Disease Control at its [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices) page when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nColombia has declared a national health emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, there have been 79 reported cases and 36 deaths since 2024, with the departments of Tolima and Putumayo being the most affected.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
