    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises important points I underweighted: the base rate for monthly records is inherently low even during rapid warming, and the ENSO transition's 0.1-0.2°C cooling effect is substantial. The regional data is particularly valuable - Ahmedabad's 3.3°C below normal May with record rainfall represents significant cooling in a major region, while European records (UK, Scotland, Brittany) and International Falls anomaly suggest warmth elsewhere. This regional heterogeneity is critical evidence I lacked. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that global records require exceptional warmth across most of the planet, not just selective regional heat. Forecaster 3's analysis aligns closely with mine but adds that 2025 is forecast for top 3-5 (not necessarily #1), which implies not every month will break records. The fact that April 2025 ranked second rather than first is a concrete example of this moderation principle in action.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I overweighted the momentum from early 2025's exceptional warmth and underweighted three critical factors: (1) the base rate argument - most months don't set records even in warm years, (2) the quantified ENSO transition impact of 0.1-0.2°C reduction in warming boost is substantial when the margin to beat is small (+0.95°C from 2020), and (3) the regional heterogeneity evidenced by India's significant cooling despite European warmth suggests the global average may not reach record levels. The April 2025 ranking as second-warmest (not first) demonstrates that 2025 isn't breaking every monthly record despite strong overall warmth. However, I don't agree with going as low as 30% because the exceptional performance of January, March, and April (three of four months ranking first or second), the persistent background warming trend, and the documented European heat records still provide meaningful probability that May could have achieved the necessary global anomaly. The mixed regional signals and base rate considerations warrant updating downward from my initial 50%, but the strong early-year performance prevents going below the mid-30s range.",
