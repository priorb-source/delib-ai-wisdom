  "information": "The University of Michigan's final Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) for May 2025 was 52.2, the same as the final reading for April. This followed a decline from 64.7 in February and 57.0 in March, marking a nearly 30% drop since January. The index's components also declined in April, with the Current Economic Conditions Index falling to 59.8 and the Economic Expectations Index dropping to 47.3. Consumers' short-term (one-year) inflation expectations reported in the survey rose to 6.5% in April, the highest since November 1981, while long-term inflation expectations increased to 4.4%. Historically, from 2010 to 2019, index increases of 8 points or more in a single month occurred less than 3% of the time.\n\nAccording to ADP data, U.S. private-sector hiring slowed significantly in May 2025, with only 37,000 jobs added, the slowest pace in over two years. Job losses were noted in business services, manufacturing, and education. A separate University of Michigan survey shows consumers expect unemployment to climb. Data on consumer behavior shows personal spending rose by 0.2% last month, while the savings rate increased to 4.9% in March, the highest level in nearly a year. Following the end of the pandemic-era payment pause on student loans, delinquencies jumped from 1% to 7.74%. In contrast to the University of Michigan's findings, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 98 in May from 85.7 in the prior month.\n\nThe ongoing trade war with China is a frequently cited source of uncertainty for American consumers, with the U.S. having doubled steel tariffs. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller has outlined a potential path to interest rate cuts later in the year, but noted that considerable uncertainty remains around the level of tariffs. Waller also largely dismissed the high inflation expectations recorded in the University of Michigan survey, stating a preference for market-based measures and professional forecasts.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The final report for June 2025 is expected on June 27, 2025, in 23 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The index was 52.2 in both April and May, significantly below the 60.0 threshold. The current trend is negative, and if sentiment remains at this level, the outcome will be 'No'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Economic data released in June continues to be weak. Key inflation metrics remain elevated, the labor market shows further signs of slowing, and uncertainty from the U.S.-China trade war persists. As a result, consumer sentiment stagnates or declines further from its May level of 52.2.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A combination of surprisingly positive news boosts consumer morale significantly. This could include a much stronger-than-expected June jobs report, a sharp drop in gasoline prices, and a major de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. This positive shock reverses the recent negative trend, causing the index to jump by at least 8 points.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is 15%. This is a low-probability estimate, primarily anchored on the status quo and recent trends. The Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) for May 2025 was 52.2, a level maintained from April and a steep decline from earlier in the year. For the question to resolve as 'Yes', the index must jump by at least 7.9 points. A single-month increase of this magnitude is historically rare, occurring less than 3% of the time between 2010 and 2019.\n\nThe fundamental data supports this pessimistic outlook. Consumers' one-year inflation expectations within the UMich survey are at a four-decade high of 6.5%, a key driver of low sentiment. This is corroborated by deteriorating labor market data, such as the weak ADP private-sector hiring report for May, and rising consumer financial stress, evidenced by the sharp increase in student loan delinquencies. Uncertainty from the ongoing trade war further weighs on consumer outlooks.\n\nMy probability is not lower primarily due to the conflicting signal from the Conference Board's consumer confidence index, which saw a substantial increase in May. While the UMich and Conference Board surveys can diverge, this notable difference prevents a more confident 'No' forecast. The UMich index is also known for its volatility, and a positive external shock—such as a sudden drop in energy prices or a resolution to the trade dispute—could cause a rapid rebound.\n\nI would increase my forecast if the preliminary June UMich sentiment reading shows a strong rebound, or if there is a confluence of unambiguously positive economic news, such as a very strong government jobs report and a clear, dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if preliminary data suggests sentiment is weakening further.",
