  "information": "North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, with the last one occurring in September 2017. The current gap of over seven and a half years is the longest interval between tests. According to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS), the tunnels at the Punggye-ri test site are maintained in an operational condition. The U.S. State Department also assesses that the site remains capable of supporting a seventh test. The IAEA has warned about an 'exponential' expansion of North Korea's nuclear program and ongoing plutonium production at the Yongbyon facility. However, analysis of satellite imagery by the think tank 38 North shows no new tunneling activity at Punggye-ri, and there are no public reports of specific preparations such as equipment movement or other logistical arrangements that would typically precede a test.\n\nIn late April 2025, North Korea conducted the first weapons system tests for its new 5,000-ton 'Choe Hyon-class' destroyer. The tests, observed by leader Kim Jong Un, included the launch of supersonic cruise missiles, strategic cruise missiles, and anti-aircraft missiles. The warship is expected to be delivered to the navy and enter service in early 2026. Earlier in 2025, North Korea conducted several other weapons tests. In April, it tested the 'Haeil-2' underwater attack drone. In February, it test-launched strategic cruise missiles. In January, it conducted its first missile test of the year, firing an intermediate-range ballistic missile with a hypersonic glide vehicle.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has repeatedly called for strengthening the country's strategic forces. Following the destroyer weapon tests in April 2025, he stated, 'The time has come for North Korea's navy to choose to accelerate nuclear armament.' In January 2025, he said the country's nuclear weapons development program would continue 'indefinitely.' In February 2025, the US, South Korea, and Japan issued a joint statement confirming their trilateral partnership and calling for North Korea's complete nuclear disarmament, pledging to strengthen sanctions enforcement. The European Union condemned North Korea's ballistic missile launch in January 2025, calling it a violation of UN Security Council resolutions.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (through June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no nuclear test is conducted by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "North Korea continues frequent missile, naval, and UAV/drone demonstrations and aggressive rhetoric while keeping Punggye-ri in a maintained-but-idle state. Satellite imagery shows no pre-test signatures (e.g., cable-laying, increased vehicles, new temporary support structures), and no credible warnings of imminence emerge. Production of fissile material and warhead development continue without an underground detonation before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Within weeks, commercial imagery and government/leak reporting indicate classic pre-test activity at Punggye-ri (notably at Tunnel 3): cable reels and lines laid from support buildings to a portal, vehicle surges, temporary structures, possible water pumping, and security lockdowns. ROK/US intelligence warn a test is imminent. Shortly after, CTBTO IMS detects a seismic event consistent with an underground nuclear detonation, and credible sources confirm a seventh test before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: Only ~2 months remain. Nuclear tests usually exhibit observable pre-test signatures days to weeks in advance; none are publicly reported as of May 1.\n- Status quo/base rate: North Korea last tested in 2017. Despite multiple windows of heightened tension since 2022 and assessments that Punggye-ri could support a test, Pyongyang has refrained for over 7 years. The default has been continued missile testing without nuclear detonations.\n- Current signals: The site is reportedly maintained and capable (NIS, US State Dept), and the IAEA notes expanding nuclear activities. DPRK weapons testing and rhetoric are elevated in 2025 (IRBM with HGV, strategic cruise missiles, underwater drone, and destroyer weapons trials; Kim calling to accelerate nuclear armament). These raise long-run risk but are weaker near-term indicators than concrete Punggye-ri preparations. 38 North reports no new tunneling or visible specific preparations.\n- Costs/benefits: A test would bring significant diplomatic backlash and potential additional enforcement, though DPRK may perceive greater cover from geopolitical shifts. Still, Pyongyang has often achieved signaling aims via missile/satellite tests without paying the higher cost of a nuclear detonation.\nWhy not higher: With only ~61 days left and no visible pre-test signatures, the near-term likelihood is constrained. Historically, credible pre-test indicators tend to surface before detonations.\nWhy not lower: The site’s maintained readiness, ongoing fissile production, intensified weapons testing, and escalatory rhetoric keep a non-trivial chance of a rapid decision and short-notice test.\nMonitoring for updates:\n- Upward: Credible imagery-based signs at Punggye-ri (cable-laying to a portal, increased vehicles/equipment, new temporary support facilities, water pumping), official warnings from ROK/US of imminent test, unusual seismic precursors, or regime media hints tied to a specific timeline.\n- Downward: Continued absence of Punggye-ri activity through mid-June; substitution with other provocations (e.g., satellite launch) without nuclear-test signatures; indications of diplomatic calculations to avoid a detonation in the near term.",
