    "review": "- Both forecasters anchor correctly on the license-to-availability timeline and the small African sample (≈10, 16, 16, 24 weeks; Niger immediate). They also flag the same key frictions (import rules, spectrum fees, logistics) and tailwinds (Airtel partnership, regional momentum, ISL reducing ground station dependence).\n- New angles: Forecaster 3 explicitly calls out “status quo bias” and the fact that 6.5 weeks remain versus a ~16-week median—useful framing that tilts slightly toward No. Forecaster 2 leans heavily on the Niger same-day launch and Airtel partnership to justify 60%, but without Chad-specific execution signals.\n- Where I disagree: I think 60% overweights regional coordination and Airtel without concrete Chad milestones (pricing published, local distributor comms, customs/import guidance, order page live). Given the deadline sits just before the median rollout time (~16 weeks), base-rate logic alone suggests <50% unless we see clear acceleration signals. Forecaster 3’s 40% is closer to my view.\n",
    "rationale": "- Timing: From Mar 13 to Jul 1 is ~15.5 weeks. The small African base rates center around ~16 weeks, placing the cutoff just before the median. That alone makes a Yes slightly less likely than No.\n- Chad-specific risks: Even with ISL, Starlink typically flips to “Available” when ordering/shipping and payment rails are in place. Finalizing customs/import rules, device type approval, spectrum fee administration, and local payment options can consume weeks. Chad’s landlocked status isn’t decisive for air shipments but customs and distribution readiness still matter.\n- Offsetting factors: The Airtel partnership could streamline distribution, and Niger’s same-day launch hints at regional readiness. Either could enable a faster-than-median activation, but I have not seen evidence of Chad-specific operational readiness (e.g., published pricing, official launch window, distributor announcements). Absent such signals by mid-May, the probability of a June map flip is meaningful but still <50%.\n- Map nuance: The resolution requires “Available,” not merely “Waitlist” or “Coming Soon.” New launches often have at least some cells marked Available, but if capacity gating or administrative lag leads to “Waitlist” only at first, it wouldn’t resolve Yes.\n- Net: The arguments from deliberation don’t introduce new concrete evidence to move me up. The timeline and typical administrative friction keep me slightly below even. I retain a meaningful upside for a late-June activation if we see rapid Chad-specific signals.\n- What would move me up quickly: Chad pricing published on starlink.com, local ordering enabled (address acceptance), official government/Starlink launch date, or Airtel Chad distribution details. What would move me down: reports of customs/type-approval delays, lack of visible progress by early June, or signs Starlink is throttling new country activations due to hardware/capacity.\n",
