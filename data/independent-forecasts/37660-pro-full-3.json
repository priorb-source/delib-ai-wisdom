  "information": "According to a March 25, 2025 report, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) denied reports of plans to suspend Starlink's satellite broadband service. The TRCSL Director General stated that a 'dashboard system' is required to regulate the service and that its implementation had been delayed. The Director General mentioned that the service was expected to become operational in April 2025 once the necessary systems were in place.\n\nA separate report from March 23, 2025, stated that the Sri Lankan government had put Starlink services on hold until the company guarantees government agencies the right to intercept data or communication details for national security reasons. According to the Deputy Minister of Information Technology, discussions between the Defence Ministry, TRCSL, and Starlink were still at a preliminary stage. The report also noted that the TRCSL had already approved tariff plans for Starlink services.\n\nReports from late April and early May 2025 provide context on Starlink's expansion in the region. Bangladesh's telecommunication regulator granted Starlink two 10-year operating licenses, making it the second South Asian country after Sri Lanka to approve the service. Officials indicated that Starlink was preparing to launch service in Bangladesh by May 2025. In contrast, Starlink's full license in Pakistan is delayed pending permanent registration and the clearance of technical and security checks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, May 16, 2025, the Starlink availability map does not show Sri Lanka as an 'Available' country.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations between Starlink and the Sri Lankan government over national security data access and interception capabilities continue without resolution. Concurrently, the implementation of the TRCSL's required 'dashboard system' faces further technical and bureaucratic delays, pushing the operational launch past the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Sri Lankan government and Starlink quickly reach a mutually agreeable solution on security and regulatory oversight. Spurred by political will, the TRCSL finalizes and implements its monitoring system ahead of schedule, giving Starlink the final green light to launch service in June 2025, at which point the company updates its availability map.",
    "rationale": "The core of this forecast hinges on whether significant regulatory and national security hurdles can be cleared within a very short timeframe. While Starlink has received its license and had tariffs approved by the TRCSL, which are positive indicators, the outstanding issues are substantial. The research report from late March 2025 highlights two key blockers: a government demand for data interception capabilities for national security, with talks described as being at a 'preliminary stage'; and a delayed 'dashboard system' required by the TRCSL for regulation, which missed its expected April 2025 implementation. The status quo is that service is not available, and overcoming these types of governmental and security negotiations often takes many months, not weeks. The short deadline of July 1, 2025, therefore, strongly favors a 'No' outcome. My forecast is not lower than 30% because there is clear intent from the Sri Lankan government to launch the service, as evidenced by the initial license approval and the optimistic (though missed) April timeline from the TRCSL Director. A swift political resolution is possible, though not probable. My forecast is not higher because national security negotiations are notoriously complex, and the description of talks as 'preliminary' in late March suggests a significant gap still to be bridged. I would increase my probability forecast upon news of a finalized agreement with the Defence Ministry. I would decrease it if official statements indicate a breakdown in talks or a revised, later timeline for the regulatory system.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
