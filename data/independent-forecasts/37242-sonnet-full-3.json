  "information": "Airlines increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025. Jet2.com announced it would offer 1.6 million seats for the summer season, an 8% increase from 2024, with new routes from Bournemouth and London-Luton starting in April. Vueling offered over 145,000 seats to and from the islands for the Easter period, a 10% increase from the previous year. Air Nostrum increased its seat offerings by 7% for the same period. Binter also launched new routes from Córdoba to Gran Canaria starting in mid-April 2025.\n\nPassenger arrival data for the Canary Islands showed year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2025. AENA reported that traffic in the Canary Islands grew by 3.6% in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024. Monthly data showed a 2.2% increase in February and another 2.2% increase in March compared to the same months in 2024. The Easter holiday period in 2025 fell entirely within April, whereas in 2024, it was in late March.\n\nOn April 28, 2025, a massive power outage occurred on the Iberian Peninsula, affecting mainland Spain and Portugal. While the Canary Islands' power grid was not directly hit, the event caused significant disruptions to air travel. Reports indicated that air traffic at major hubs was operating at reduced capacity, leading to widespread flight delays and cancellations. Canary Islands airports experienced knock-on effects, with numerous flights connecting to the mainland being cancelled or delayed. One government official stated that 344 out of 6,000 scheduled flights in Spain were cancelled on that day.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks until early June 2025 when the April 2025 passenger data will be published",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - April 2025 arrivals will be equal to or greater than April 2024",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The strong growth trend from Q1 2025 (2.2-3.6% increases) continues into April. The significantly increased airline capacity (8-10% increases from major carriers) translates into higher passenger volumes. The favorable Easter calendar timing - with Easter falling entirely within April 2025 versus late March 2024 - provides an additional boost. The April 28 power outage, while disruptive, affects only one day out of thirty and causes minimal impact on overall monthly totals.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The April 28 power outage has cascading effects beyond the immediate day, causing multi-day disruptions and mass cancellations that ripple through the end of the month. Combined with potential impacts from Trump administration policies on US tourism and other unforeseen factors, these disruptions are severe enough to completely offset the structural growth trends and favorable Easter timing.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors continued growth (NO outcome). Multiple structural factors point toward April 2025 exceeding April 2024: (1) Major airlines increased capacity by 7-10% with new routes launching specifically in April 2025, (2) Q1 2025 showed consistent growth of 2.2-3.6% across all months, establishing a clear upward trend, (3) Easter 2025 fell entirely within April versus late March 2024, providing a significant calendar advantage for April comparisons. The April 28 power outage is the main concerning factor, affecting 344 out of 6,000 flights on that single day (approximately 5.7% of one day's flights, or roughly 0.2% of monthly flights). Even with knock-on effects, one day's disruption is unlikely to overcome an entire month of structural growth factors. For April 2025 to fall below April 2024, the disruption would need to eliminate tens or hundreds of thousands of passengers - far beyond what a single-day event could reasonably cause. I'm not forecasting higher confidence because: (1) we don't have complete April data yet, (2) the full impact of the power outage may not be fully quantified, and (3) there could be unreported factors. I'm not forecasting lower because the structural evidence is overwhelming - multiple independent growth indicators all point in the same direction, and the one negative event (power outage) is clearly insufficient to reverse a month-long trend. To update toward YES, I would need evidence of: massive multi-day disruptions, significant cancellations continuing through April 29-30, or major unexpected shocks affecting the entire month.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAirlines increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025.
