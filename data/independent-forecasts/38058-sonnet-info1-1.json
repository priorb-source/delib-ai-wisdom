  "information": "U.S. President Donald Trump has postponed the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, moving the deadline from June 1 to July 9, 2025. The delay came after a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who stated more time was needed for negotiations. U.S. officials have expressed frustration with the EU's cautious approach and lack of specific proposals in the trade talks. A key U.S. demand for a new trade agreement is a commitment from the EU to impose tariffs on Chinese industrial goods, which has not yet been agreed to.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "35 days remaining (from May 26, 2025 to June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - tariffs continue appearing on front pages of both papers",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariffs remain a dominant news story throughout the period. Trump's trade policy continues generating daily coverage, especially with the postponed EU tariff deadline (moved to July 9) creating ongoing negotiations and speculation. Both papers consistently feature tariff-related stories or mentions in their front page news summaries every day through June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On at least one day in late May or June, both papers are dominated by other major breaking news - perhaps a significant international crisis, major domestic political development, natural disaster, or other compelling story - that pushes tariff coverage off the front pages entirely on the same day. This could also occur on a weekend edition with lighter political coverage.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors continued tariff coverage. Trump has made tariffs his signature economic policy, and the research indicates active developments: the EU tariff deadline was just postponed from June 1 to July 9, 2025, with ongoing negotiations. This postponement itself is newsworthy and will likely generate continued coverage through June as the new deadline approaches. The fact that U.S. officials are frustrated with EU negotiations suggests this story will remain active. However, the question only requires ONE day where BOTH papers omit tariffs. Over 35 remaining days, this creates some probability of success. Major breaking news could theoretically dominate both front pages simultaneously, pushing tariffs aside. Weekend editions sometimes have different coverage priorities. The challenge is that both papers must omit tariffs on the SAME day - major newspapers typically cover similar major stories, and tariffs are currently central to U.S. economic policy. The broad definition (including any mention in news summaries, not just headline stories) makes it harder for tariffs to disappear. I'm not forecasting higher because: (1) tariffs are THE defining Trump trade policy, (2) active EU negotiations will generate ongoing coverage, (3) both papers must coincide, and (4) May-June is prime time for trade policy developments. I'm not lower because: (1) 35 days provides reasonable opportunity, (2) major unrelated events could dominate, and (3) news cycles can shift unpredictably. I would update higher if: major non-tariff crises emerge, or EU negotiations stall quietly. I would update lower if: new tariff announcements occur or trade tensions escalate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. Before July, will we see tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on any single day after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, the words \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\" appear on neither the digital version of the front page of The New York Times nor the Wall Street Journal.

Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\n* Grammar or spelling will not prevent a **No** resolution.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, including \"Pages A2-A3 and Corrections\", \"What's News: Business & Finance\" not just the initial section at the top. The only sections that do not qualify are those that do not change between different front pages such as the \"Most Popular News\" or \"Recommended Videos\" sections on WSJ.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nU.S. President Donald Trump has postponed the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, moving the deadline from June 1 to July 9, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
