    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, as Javier Milei's current approval rating of 61% is higher than Claudia Sheinbaum's 60%.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Claudia Sheinbaum's approval rating rises slightly due to a popular policy announcement or a period of positive news, while Milei's rating dips by a point or two following protests against his economic austerity measures. This results in Sheinbaum's rating being equal to or greater than Milei's on the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Positive economic news in Argentina, such as a further significant drop in the monthly inflation rate, shores up or slightly increases Milei's support. Meanwhile, Sheinbaum's approval remains stable or sees a minor dip, ensuring Milei maintains his lead.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored by the current status quo. As of today, Javier Milei has a 1-point lead over Claudia Sheinbaum (61% vs 60%). Over a short timeframe of just 1.5 months, there is a strong tendency for such metrics to remain relatively stable. This initial state favors a 'Yes' outcome. However, this lead is extremely narrow and falls well within the typical margin of error for such polls, making the situation essentially a toss-up. \n\nThe primary factors influencing my judgment are the differing political contexts and leadership styles. Claudia Sheinbaum's approval is generally high and stable, reflecting the continued popularity of her party, MORENA, in Mexico. It is less likely to experience significant short-term fluctuations barring a major unexpected event. Conversely, Javier Milei's presidency is characterized by radical 'shock therapy' economic reforms. His approval is consequently more volatile and highly sensitive to breaking news, particularly monthly inflation data and public reaction to his austerity measures. \n\nThe resolution criterion that a tie resolves as 'No' introduces a slight bias against a 'Yes' outcome. A 1-point drop for Milei or a 1-point rise for Sheinbaum would flip the result. Given Milei's higher volatility, such a small shift is very plausible. Therefore, while the status quo is 'Yes', the fragility of the lead and the higher variance in Milei's approval pushes the probability down close to 50%. I settle at 52% to give a slight edge to the incumbant state of affairs over this short period.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the 1-point lead is statistically insignificant, and Milei's volatile political situation could easily lead to a minor dip in support. It is not lower because he is, in fact, currently ahead, and positive economic data (like falling inflation) could just as easily solidify his standing. I would increase my probability for 'Yes' upon news of a significant economic success or political victory for Milei. I would decrease it upon news of major protests in Argentina or a significant policy success for Sheinbaum.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Javier Milei have a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, Sheinbaum is at 60% as compared with Milei at 61%.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Javier Milei has a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum at [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. A tie or a lead by Sheinbaum resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
