    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The spring owners meeting concludes without a vote to change the rule, or the Competition Committee declines to advance a proposal. Media reports after the meeting indicate any action is deferred to the 2026 cycle, leaving the Tush-Push legal through June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At the May 2025 owners meeting the league approves a Competition Committee or club proposal that restricts the play (e.g., re-banning aiding the runner by pushing, or otherwise limiting formations/assistance on QB sneaks). The NFL issues an official announcement before June 1.",
    "rationale": "- Process and timing: Major playing-rule changes typically pass at the March Annual Meeting, with May meetings used less often for core playing-rule changes. With only ~20 days left, the remaining realistic window is the spring owners meeting in mid/late May. That concentrates the probability but also limits runway. \n- Status quo and inertia: The play survived multiple recent review cycles. Past rationale against a ban included enforcement clarity and limited injury data pointing to excess risk. Absent a compelling new safety argument or competitive-balance crisis, inertia favors no change. \n- Vote hurdle: Playing-rule changes require 24 of 32 owners. Building that coalition late in the cycle is nontrivial, especially after past tabling. \n- Countervailing signals: Reporting indicated there could be stronger support for an expansive ban at a future meeting, suggesting the idea isn’t dead and could surface on the May agenda. If the Competition Committee formally recommends a change, passage odds rise. \n- Net: With no confirmed passage at the March 2025 meeting and only the May meeting left, a ban before June 1 remains possible but less likely than not. \n- Research assistant: No new information provided. \n- Why not higher: Lack of March action, historical reluctance to ban, enforcement concerns, and the 24-vote threshold. \n- Why not lower: Public, media, and some club pressure to address the play; reports of potential strong support; and the imminent May meeting still offers a procedural path. \n- What would move me up: Credible reports that (1) a specific anti–Tush-Push proposal is on the May agenda, (2) the Competition Committee endorses it, and/or (3) whip counts suggest 24+ votes. \n- What would move me down: Reporting that the item is off the agenda, that it’s been tabled to 2026, or that owners lack votes after caucusing at the spring meeting.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the NFL ban the \"Tush-Push\" before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nESPN: [Vote on tush push ban tabled by NFL owners for more discussion](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44490292/sources-tush-push-ban-vote-tabled-nfl-owners) | CBS Sports: [Expansive 'Tush Push' ban could have strong support at NFL's next owners meeting, per report](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/expansive-tush-push-ban-could-have-strong-support-at-nfls-next-owners-meeting-per-report/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Football League officially approves or announces a rule restricting the quarterback sneak known as the [Tush-Push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sneak#Tush_push) before June 1, 2025. If there are no reports of this occurring before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
