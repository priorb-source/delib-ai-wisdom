  "information": "The Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command is formally investigating the band over footage from two separate events. One investigation concerns a video from a 2024 concert where a band member allegedly said, 'The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.' Another investigation relates to a 2023 concert where a band member appeared to chant, 'up Hamas, up Hezbollah.' Following public backlash, the band issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess. Several UK politicians and government ministers have publicly called for Glastonbury to remove Kneecap from the festival's lineup.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The festival is scheduled for June 25-29, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Kneecap is currently on the official Glastonbury 2025 lineup and is scheduled to perform.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury organizers remove Kneecap from the lineup. This decision is driven by the formal counter-terrorism investigation into the band and associated security advice from the police, combined with intense political pressure. The festival prioritizes attendee safety and mitigates legal, reputational, and licensing risks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury's organizers withstand the political pressure and keep Kneecap on the bill. The police investigation does not result in charges or a formal recommendation to cancel before the event date. The band performs as scheduled, with the festival likely framing the decision as a stand for artistic freedom.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the conflict between the status quo and the extraordinary pressure created by a formal police investigation. Currently, Kneecap is on the lineup, and inertia is a powerful force in forecasting. Glastonbury Festival also has a long history of resisting political pressure and supporting controversial artists, which favors a 'Yes' outcome. However, the information from my research assistant indicates this is not a typical controversy. The involvement of the Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command, investigating alleged support for proscribed terrorist groups and incitement to kill a Member of Parliament, elevates the situation significantly. This introduces substantial risks for the festival organizers, including potential legal liability, loss of their operating license, and major security challenges. While Glastonbury may wish to defend artistic expression, a formal security recommendation from the police against the performance would be nearly impossible to ignore. My probability is not lower than 40% because Glastonbury is a uniquely independent organization that may still choose to hold its ground, especially if the police investigation does not advance significantly before the festival date. The band's apology may also provide the organizers with enough cover to proceed. My probability is not higher than 40% because the gravity of a counter-terrorism investigation and the associated security implications for an event with over 200,000 attendees present a compelling reason for cancellation that transcends typical political disputes. The outcome likely hinges on whether the police formally recommend the band's removal in the coming month.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command is formally investigating the band over footage from two separate events. One investigation concerns a video from a 2024 concert where a band member allegedly said, 'The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
