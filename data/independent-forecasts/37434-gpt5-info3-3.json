  "information": "By March 2025, AquaBounty's market capitalization had fallen to approximately $2.2 million, with its stock price dropping from a 52-week high of $3.05 to well below $1. The stock is trading below the NASDAQ compliance threshold, risking delisting. Despite the low price, institutional investor Epiq Partners LLC increased its holdings in the company by 423.5% in the fourth quarter. As of early 2025, institutional investors and hedge funds own 8.92% of the company's stock.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty discloses limited but adequate liquidity for the next couple of months, executes a small bridge financing or ATM equity raise, cuts cash burn at its operating sites, and/or pursues an asset sale or strategic alternative without filing. They may also proceed with a reverse split or accept OTC trading if delisted, buying time past July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cash runway proves shorter than expected; vendors tighten terms; a debt, lease, or payables squeeze hits in May/June; Nasdaq delisting and failed capital raise undermine confidence; the board opts for a Chapter 11 (or 7) filing to protect assets and orchestrate a sale or wind-down before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon is short. With ~8 weeks left, even highly distressed microcaps often avoid an immediate filing unless a near-term liquidity cliff or creditor action forces the issue. This tilts the base rate toward “No” over such a brief window.\n- Distress indicators are severe: very low market cap (~$2.2M per the assistant’s report), persistent losses, long-running financing challenges around the Ohio facility, and likely going-concern language in recent filings. Shares trade below Nasdaq minimum bid, increasing operational and financing pressure. These factors elevate the near-term hazard.\n- Offsetting factors: Companies at this stage often find stopgap measures (small equity raises, insider or specialty-creditor bridge loans, cost cuts, asset monetization) that can extend runway by weeks to months. The reported increase in holdings by Epiq Partners doesn’t guarantee anything but suggests some investors anticipate a non-bankruptcy path (financing or asset sale) rather than an immediate filing. Also, the question resolves strictly on a US bankruptcy petition; firms can and do delay filings while exploring alternatives.\n- Key forthcoming info: The Q1 2025 10-Q/earnings update will likely disclose cash on hand and runway. If management states cash sufficiency only through June absent financing, or discloses default risks or tightened vendor terms, I would raise the probability. Conversely, any announced financing, asset sale, or strategic partnership that extends runway past July 1 would lower it.\n- Why not higher: Even very distressed issuers frequently avoid filing on a specific short timeline; absent a disclosed maturity or acute creditor action before July 1, the status quo (no filing in the next ~8 weeks) remains a bit more likely.\n- Why not lower: The combination of microcap valuation, going-concern risk, Nasdaq compliance issues, and likely ongoing cash burn meaningfully raises the chance of a near-term petition compared to a typical small-cap. A single failed financing attempt could bring a June filing.\n- Update triggers:\n  • Up: 10-Q shows cash runway into only late Q2; notices of default; vendor lawsuits; delisting and failed capital raise; halted payroll or operational shutdowns.\n  • Down: Announced bridge financing/ATM raise; asset sale or secured DIP-like financing without filing; successful reverse split/compliance plan; evidence of materially lower burn.\nGiven these, I put material but sub-50% odds on a filing before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill AquaBounty Technologies file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[AquaBounty Technologies Announces Full Year 2024 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603978/000160397825000012/aqb-20250327xex99_1.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBy March 2025, AquaBounty's market capitalization had fallen to approximately $2.2 million, with its stock price dropping from a 52-week high of $3.05 to well below $1. The stock is trading below the NASDAQ compliance threshold, risking delisting.

As of early 2025, institutional investors and hedge funds own 8.92% of the company's stock.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
