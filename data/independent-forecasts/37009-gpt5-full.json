  "information": "According to an April 19, 2025, Politico report, Haley Stevens was 'widely expected to declare her Senate candidacy as early as next week.' On the same day, both the Washington Examiner and the Livingston Post reported that Stevens was expected to announce her bid 'in the coming weeks,' a slightly more ambiguous timeframe.\n\nAs of April 15, 2025, Haley Stevens had $1.6 million in her campaign fund, having raised approximately $1.2 million in the first quarter of the year. Reports also indicate that she has expanded her campaign staff and has been contacting potential candidates to replace her in her current House seat.\n\nSeveral prominent Democrats, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, have opted not to run for the Senate seat. Meanwhile, other Democratic candidates such as Mallory McMorrow and Abdul El-Sayed have already officially entered the race. As of late April 2025, Stevens had not filed any paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form an exploratory committee.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "10 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Stevens keeps signaling interest but delays the formal rollout into early May to firm up endorsements, staffing, or strategy—or she opts against running. No press release, launch video, or public statement of candidacy appears before May 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Her team releases a launch video and press advisory, followed by a Detroit-area event or media hits between Apr 22–30. She announces first and files FEC paperwork within 15 days, or files the same day.",
    "rationale": "- Anchor/status quo: As of Apr 21 there has been no announcement; if nothing changed, the question would resolve No. Good forecasting gives that inertia some weight. \n- Evidence pushing toward Yes: Multiple credible reports (Politico on Apr 19: “as early as next week”; Washington Examiner and Livingston Post: “in the coming weeks”) indicate near-term timing. She reportedly has $1.6M on hand after a strong Q1 ($1.2M raised), has expanded staff, and is contacting potential successors for her House seat—classic pre-launch behavior. Major alternatives (Whitmer, Buttigieg) are out, and other Democrats (e.g., Mallory McMorrow, Abdul El-Sayed) have already jumped in, increasing the incentive for Stevens to move sooner to capture attention and donors. The end-of-month fundraising deadline provides a natural reason to announce before May 1. \n- Countervailing factors: As of late April she had not formed an exploratory committee with the FEC (not strictly necessary) and some reporting used the softer “coming weeks” phrasing, which leaves room for slippage into May. Launches can be delayed by venue scheduling, endorsement sequencing, or late-breaking internal polling. \n- Why not higher: Political rollouts slip with some frequency; even “next week” guidance can miss by days. The absence of a filed exploratory or clear public advisory is a mild negative. \n- Why not lower: The clustering of signals (money in the bank, staff build-out, succession planning, and well-sourced reporting) strongly suggests an imminent announcement, and there are several viable weekdays left (Apr 22–25, 28–30). \n- What would move me up: A media advisory for a Detroit-area event, a launch video leak, new reporting naming a specific day, domain/branding and paid media buys, or FEC filings designating a Senate committee. \n- What would move me down: Reporting that she’s pausing to consolidate support, indications of major endorsements for a rival that change her calculus, or news of scheduling/strategic delays into May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Haley Stevens announce her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [Democrats lose another top contender for US Senate seat in Michigan after Whitmer and Buttigieg bow out](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/politics/michigan-senate-race-democrats-mcdonald-rivet/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Haley Stevens announces her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to an April 19, 2025, Politico report, Haley Stevens was 'widely expected to declare her Senate candidacy as early as next week.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
