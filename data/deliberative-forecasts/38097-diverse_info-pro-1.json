    "review": "The other two forecasters seem to be operating with incomplete information, leading them to significantly underestimate the probability of a 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 2 incorrectly claims that \"none of the five specific candidates...have been mentioned as disqualified yet.\" This is in direct contradiction to my evidence that Laurent Gbagbo is already considered disqualified and struck from the electoral list. Forecaster 3 acknowledges the \"longstanding uncertainty\" around Gbagbo but frames his potential disqualification as a future risk that may or may not be confirmed by July 1. Both analyses miss the central point from my research: Gbagbo's disqualification is not a future possibility, but a present reality according to credible reports. Their reasoning, being based on an incomplete or misunderstood evidentiary basis, is unconvincing.",
    "rationale": "I am not updating my forecast. My initial reasoning stands, as it is based on the most critical piece of evidence provided: as of late May 2025, Laurent Gbagbo is already reported as being struck from the electoral list. The resolution criteria are therefore currently met. The question effectively becomes: 'What is the probability this existing disqualification will be reversed in the next 31 days?' The other forecasters did not provide any new evidence or arguments suggesting a reversal (such as a presidential pardon or a high-probability legal appeal) is likely. Instead, their analyses focused on the probability of a *new* disqualification event occurring, which misframes the problem. Since my high confidence is based on a confirmed, existing state of affairs that directly resolves the question, and no compelling counter-evidence has been introduced, my forecast remains unchanged.",
