    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my base case. Forecaster 3 adds a key legal/timing constraint (elections must be held 45–60 days after they’re called) that I hadn’t explicitly weighed. That materially reduces the odds of an announcement before July 1 if the government prefers an autumn vote, since a pre–July 1 decree would force July/August elections—politically suboptimal. Forecaster 2’s analysis mirrors my prior reasoning on cabinet freshness, waning protests, and Vučić’s tactical ambiguity. I find the 45–60 day argument especially persuasive and it pushes me down from my initial estimate.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~6 weeks. Procedurally sufficient, politically short given a new cabinet secured confidence in mid‑April.\n- Status quo: The constitutional trigger is gone; officials emphasize a stable majority; protests have lost steam and the opposition is divided. Default outcome is no announcement.\n- New consideration: Serbian law requires elections 45–60 days after they’re called. An announcement before July 1 would imply late July/August elections—an unattractive window. If the ruling party wants an autumn contest, they would likely wait to announce until late July/August, not before July 1.\n- Upside risks remain: Vučić’s history of snap polls and his recent “decision within ten days” rhetoric leave a tail risk of a sudden call (e.g., to catch the opposition off‑guard or respond to a shock). A sharp protest resurgence, coalition strain, or a strategic polling window could still trigger a pre–July 1 decree.\nGiven the fresh cabinet, messaging of stability, waning protest pressure, and the 45–60 day constraint making summer elections unattractive, I lower my estimate from 20% to 15%.",
