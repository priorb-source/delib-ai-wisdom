    "review": "Both forecasters raise important arguments I initially underweighted. Forecaster 2's emphasis on signaling to international creditors (IMF/World Bank) is compelling - this provides a stronger motivation for near-term action than I credited. Forecaster 3's point about needing either a pre-set cadence or a deliberate symbolic decision helpfully frames the decision space. Both note that the first payment proves the administrative mechanism works, lowering barriers to subsequent payments.\n\nHowever, I find their higher probabilities (35% and 46%) harder to justify given the evidence gaps. Key concerns:\n\n1. **No evidence of a payment schedule**: All three of us acknowledge this critical missing piece. Without reporting of planned tranches or allocated funds, we're speculating about intent rather than observing preparation.\n\n2. **The first payment may have already served its signaling purpose**: The April 9th payment plus the April 10th reaffirmation article could constitute the complete signaling package for this period. Why assume more is needed before June 1?\n\n3. **Timeframe remains extremely tight**: Even with a working mechanism, 5-6 weeks for budget allocation, approval processes, and disbursement is aggressive for any government, especially one with chronic FX constraints.\n\n4. **Base rate considerations**: The 5-year gap before the first payment suggests these are major events requiring significant preparation, not routine monthly transactions.\n\nThe signaling argument does warrant an upward revision from my initial 15%, but the complete absence of evidence for a planned second payment keeps me more conservative than my peers.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast upward but remaining more conservative than Forecasters 2 and 3.\n\nWhat I'm updating on:\n- The signaling value to international creditors is a stronger motivator than I initially assessed. If Zimbabwe is actively negotiating debt relief or IMF support, a second payment could be strategically valuable.\n- The momentum effect is real - the administrative pathway is now proven functional, which does lower barriers.\n- The recent reaffirmation suggests this may be an active phase rather than a one-off.\n\nWhat keeps me lower than others:\n- Zero concrete evidence of a second payment being planned, budgeted, or scheduled\n- The first payment plus public reaffirmation may have already achieved the signaling objective for this quarter\n- Zimbabwe's chronic fiscal constraints and FX shortages haven't suddenly disappeared\n- Two payments in 7 weeks would be unprecedented given the 5-year gap to reach the first one\n- The question launched recently, meaning any second payment would need rapid decision-making and execution\n\nMy updated view: There's perhaps a 20-25% chance that Zimbabwe makes a small symbolic follow-up payment to maintain momentum with creditors, but the base case remains that the April payment was the only one planned for this period. The lack of any reporting on subsequent payments or schedules is telling.",
