  "information": "A trend of 'reverse purchasing' has emerged where foreign tourists, particularly from the US, travel to China to purchase goods. According to Alipay data from the first half of April 2025, spending by foreign tourists in China increased 1.5 times compared to the same period in the previous year, with spending by US users doubling. This trend is attributed to improvements in China's manufacturing quality and favorable policies such as 'departure tax refund' and 'buy and refund' services. The changing international trade environment, including US tariffs, has also been cited as a contributing factor.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (mention window is June 10–June 30; resolution on July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "NYT covers the broader trend (foreign tourists shopping in China) but uses different wording like “reverse consumption,” “reverse shopping,” or simply describes the behavior without the exact phrases “reverse purchasing” or “reverse purchase.” No item dated June 10–30 includes the exact phrase captured by the linked NYT searches.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A China-focused news/feature piece or a newsletter (e.g., The Morning, DealBook) references Chinese state media’s framing and quotes the term, writing something like: “Chinese outlets call the phenomenon ‘reverse purchasing,’” or an explainer explicitly uses the phrase. Alternatively, a business/markets piece oddly employs the exact phrase “reverse purchase,” triggering the search match.",
    "rationale": "- Definition sensitivity: Resolution requires the exact phrases “reverse purchasing” or “reverse purchase” as returned by the specified NYT search, and only for items dated June 10–30, 2025. Even if NYT covers the phenomenon, any alternate wording fails the criterion. That specificity pushes the base rate toward No.\n- Editorial style and jargon: NYT typically avoids adopting state-media coinages unless explicitly quoting them. If they do cover the trend, “reverse consumption” or “reverse shopping” seem more idiomatic than “reverse purchasing.” This further lowers the odds that the exact phrases appear.\n- Time window: Only ~21 publication days (June 10–30) are eligible. Narrow windows reduce chances.\n- Topical demand: The research assistant notes a real trend—foreign tourist spending in China up (Alipay data) and a propaganda-friendly label (“reverse purchasing”). That creates a plausible news peg for at least one China/Business piece, and NYT sometimes quotes such terms to explain discourse. This prevents the probability from being near-zero.\n- Why not higher: The requirement for exact phrasing, the short window, and NYT’s likely preference for alternative wording make a hit unlikely.\n- Why not lower: The term is currently being amplified by Chinese media; US tariffs and travel data provide a timely hook; a single mention in any NYT content item (including newsletters) would suffice.\n- Update triggers upward: If other major English-language outlets (AP, Bloomberg, WSJ, FT) start using the exact phrase “reverse purchasing,” or if Chinese social media discourse drives the English translation into wider usage; if NYT publishes a China consumer trend explainer around mid/late June; or visible NYT reporters tease such coverage on social media.\n- Update triggers downward: If the topic fades from English-language coverage or competing terms (“reverse consumption/shopping”) become the standard translation in Western media over the next two weeks; or if the NYT focuses elsewhere (e.g., U.S. elections, EU elections, Fed decisions) with limited China features in that window.\n- Research assistant influence: The noted surge in foreign tourist spending and policy supports (tax refunds, easier payments) increase plausibility of coverage, but do not ensure the exact phrase is used. Hence a modest uplift from near-zero to low single digits.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the New York Times mention \"reverse purchasing\" before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPeople's Daily: [“Reverse purchasing” reflects the vitality of the Chinese market](http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2025/0430/c1004-40471159.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the NY Times mentions \"reverse purchasing\" in any of its content items as found through [this search](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchasing%22&sort=best), dated after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
