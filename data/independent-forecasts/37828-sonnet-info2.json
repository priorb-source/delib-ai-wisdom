  "information": "In multiple interviews in May 2025, following the company's Series G funding round, Rippling CEO Parker Conrad stated that the company has \"no specific plans to go public\" and an IPO is \"not imminent.\" He emphasized that Rippling would need to be profitable before going public, stating, \"in order to be successful in the public markets, your growth rates have to come down so that you can be profitable.\" Conrad also mentioned that the company plans to conduct annual secondary liquidity programs, such as tender offers, for employees and investors.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days (from May 22, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Rippling maintains its private status without announcing IPO plans",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rippling continues executing its current strategy as outlined by CEO Parker Conrad: remaining private, focusing on achieving profitability, and providing liquidity to employees and investors through annual tender offers rather than pursuing an IPO",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite recent CEO statements, Rippling experiences a dramatic shift in circumstances—such as an unexpected market opportunity, competitive pressure, or strategic imperative—that leads management to reverse course and announce IPO plans within the next 40 days, either through an SEC Form S-1 filing or announcement on their website",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors a No outcome. Most critically, in May 2025 (the current month), CEO Parker Conrad made explicit statements that Rippling has 'no specific plans to go public' and an IPO is 'not imminent.' These statements are not ambiguous and were made in multiple interviews following their Series G funding round. The CEO also established clear prerequisites, stating the company needs to be profitable before going public, suggesting they haven't yet met this self-imposed requirement. Additionally, Rippling has an alternative liquidity strategy through annual tender offers, reducing pressure for an IPO. The timeline is extraordinarily compressed—only 40 days remain. Going from 'no plans' to a formal IPO announcement typically requires months of preparation including selecting underwriters, preparing S-1 documentation, and board approval. While companies occasionally surprise markets with announcements, and CEOs sometimes make deflecting statements before planned announcements, the combination of explicit recent denial, tight timeline, and stated prerequisites makes this highly unlikely. I'm not forecasting 0-1% because occasional surprises do occur and strategic positioning is possible, but I'm not going higher because the CEO's statements are unambiguous, contemporary, and specific. For me to update higher, I would need evidence of S-1 preparation, underwriter selection, or explicit reversal of Conrad's statements. The forecast remains very low at 3%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Rippling announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Startup News: Shares of HR firm Rippling gain value as its business expands](https://forgeglobal.com/insights/blog/startup-news-shares-of-rippling-gain-value-as-its-business-expands/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Rippling, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.rippling.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn multiple interviews in May 2025, following the company's Series G funding round, Rippling CEO Parker Conrad stated that the company has \"no specific plans to go public\" and an IPO is \"not imminent.\" He emphasized that Rippling would need to be profitable before going public, stating, \"in order to be successful in the public markets, your growth rates have to come down so that you can be profitable.\" Conrad also mentioned that the company plans to conduct annual secondary liquidity programs, such as tender offers, for employees and investors.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
