    "review": "The other forecasters raised a critical issue I initially underweighted: the fundamental uncertainty about whether Mark Carney is actually serving as Canadian Prime Minister. Forecaster 3 explicitly noted that Justin Trudeau was PM as of their last knowledge, and questioned Carney's status. All three of us lack concrete confirmation from the research assistant about current conditions. This matters enormously - if Carney is not PM by July 1, 2025, the question likely resolves No by default (no approval rating exists to compare). The question's phrasing 'Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney' assumes he holds the position, but this could be forward-looking or hypothetical. I also appreciate Forecaster 3's point about Trump potentially experiencing his own second-term honeymoon effect, which I hadn't adequately considered as a countervailing factor to any Carney honeymoon. Forecaster 2's emphasis on base rates (most world leaders polling higher than Trump) is reasonable but doesn't overcome the status uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I significantly underweighted the probability that Mark Carney is not currently Prime Minister. While the question's framing suggests he is PM, we have zero confirmation of this critical fact. If there's a 30-40% chance Carney isn't PM (and won't become PM by July 1), this dramatically affects the overall probability. Even if Carney is PM, I should adjust for: (1) Trump experiencing his own potential second-term bounce rather than mid-term doldrums, (2) only 6.5 weeks until resolution provides limited time for Carney to establish strong approval ratings if he's very recently installed, (3) Morning Consult's methodology and sampling might not show the patterns we'd expect from historical norms. My calculation now: P(Yes) = P(Carney is PM by July 1) × P(Higher approval | Carney is PM). Assigning roughly 65% to Carney being PM and 70% to him having higher approval conditional on being PM yields approximately 45-46%. This represents a significant downward revision from my initial 60%, bringing me closer to Forecaster 3's cautious 48%.",
