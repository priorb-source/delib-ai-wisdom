    "review": "- New arguments I hadn’t fully weighed: Forecaster 2’s explicit run-rate arithmetic tied to FY2025-to-date deficits is useful for bounding likely levels by late June, though it underweights the binding-debt-limit dynamic. Forecaster 3 correctly foregrounds the debt-limit step-change pathway and the potential magnitude from restoring extraordinary measures and rebuilding the TGA.\n- Convincing points: Both emphasize that a move of several hundred billion in a few weeks is uncommon absent a debt-limit resolution plus immediate catch-up. F3’s emphasis on the timing/magnitude uncertainty of any late-June deal is important.\n- Where I disagree: F2’s implicit baseline (mid-35s to ~36T by late spring purely from deficit flow) doesn’t reflect that the debt ceiling has likely been binding since Jan 2, 2025, keeping the reported Total Public Debt Outstanding near the reinstated cap. That makes ≥$37T by June 27 even harder. F3’s 30% seems high without evidence the starting point is already in the high-$36Ts or that a June deal would prompt an unusually rapid, large TGA rebuild within days.\n- Net: Their input mostly reinforces my original view (No is favored); it nudges me slightly toward allowing a bit more upside tail if a debt-limit deal lands in early/mid-June with a swift cash build, but not as high as 30%.",
    "rationale": "My prior stance was that “No” is favored (~88% No, i.e., ~12% Yes). I maintain that basic view with a slight upward nod to tail risk.\nKey points:\n- Proximity: With the debt limit reinstated Jan 2, 2025, the reported Total Public Debt Outstanding has likely been constrained near that level. Even after a resolution, the immediate step-up from restoring extraordinary measures plus a fast TGA rebuild typically totals on the order of a few hundred billion to perhaps ~$0.7–1.0T over several weeks, not enough to go from roughly ~35T to ≥37T by June 27. To clear $37T in late June, the starting level would need to be around ≥$36.3–$36.6T by mid-June; absent evidence of that, it’s unlikely.\n- Timing: We’re ~3 weeks from the resolution date. June quarterly tax receipts usually damp near-term net borrowing. Even if a ceiling deal arrives in early/mid-June, operationally getting all the way to ≥$37T by the 27th would require unusually aggressive, rapid issuance and restorations.\n- Upside pathway: A mid-June deal with explicit Treasury guidance for a very rapid TGA rebuild (e.g., toward ~$800B–$1T) and large cash management bills could push totals higher quickly. That risk keeps the probability above near-zero.\n- Downside pathway: If the ceiling remains binding into late June, the headline total should hold near the cap, well below $37T.\nGiven the deliberation, I slightly adjust upward to reflect the possibility of a June deal plus swift catch-up, but I remain well below 50% because the starting level and time window make ≥$37T by June 27 a stretch.\nWhat would move me: (1) Debt to the Penny prints in mid-June ≥$36.6T; (2) Congress passes a ceiling increase/suspension in early/mid-June with Treasury signaling rapid TGA rebuild; (3) Announced large cash management bills. Conversely, confirmation that the ceiling remains binding into late June would push me lower.",
