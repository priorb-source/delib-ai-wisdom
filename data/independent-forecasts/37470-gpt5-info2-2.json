  "information": "Egypt has a recent history of hosting major international sporting events. In April 2025, the country hosted the World Karate Premier League in Cairo, which involved 384 players from 67 countries. In May 2025, Egypt hosted the Pharaohs' Championship for Rhythmic Gymnastics with 18 participating countries, the African Championship for Rhythmic Gymnastics with 8 participating countries, and the 25th World Military Equestrian Championship with 20 participating nations. Egypt is also scheduled to host the Senior World Karate Championships (an event of the separate World Karate Federation) in November 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement by ITKF before the deadline, so the market resolves No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Talks continue but ITKF delays a board vote or public confirmation until after July 1, or selects Egypt (or another host) but announces it later or via non-official channels only.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ITKF’s executive board/congress approves Egypt and ITKF posts an official announcement (website, press release, or verified social channels) confirming Egypt as the 2026 host before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: As of today there is no ITKF announcement. With less than two months left, the status quo (no official confirmation yet) is sticky. Small federations often move slower or tie host selections to congress dates; official communications can lag even after decisions.\n- Positive indicators: Egypt is actively pursuing the bid (minister-level engagement with the ITKF president). Egypt’s recent and upcoming hosting track record in multi-sport and karate events (e.g., WKF Premier League in April 2025; hosting WKF Senior Worlds in Nov 2025) shows strong capacity and government support. If ITKF wants a capable host with financing and lead time for 2026, selecting Egypt soon is plausible.\n- Negative/tempering factors: The required criterion is an official ITKF announcement before July 1. Even if Egypt is favored or informally chosen, bureaucratic steps, contracts, and ITKF’s communications cadence can push the public confirmation past the deadline. There may also be competing bids or an intent to announce at a later ITKF meeting.\n- Why not higher: Short runway to July 1; reliance on a formal ITKF announcement; potential for procedural delays or competing hosts.\n- Why not lower: Active, public high-level talks right now; Egypt’s strong hosting pedigree; 2026 timing encourages earlier selection; the bid aligns with Egypt’s sports-hosting strategy.\n- Updaters to raise probability: Credible reports of an ITKF board vote scheduled in May/June; signed MoU or contract between ITKF and Egypt; ITKF teaser posts about Egypt; agenda showing host selection at an imminent ITKF assembly.\n- Updaters to lower probability: News of other candidate hosts gaining traction; ITKF indicating host selection will occur at a late-2025 congress; continued silence from ITKF channels through June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the International Traditional Karate Federation announce that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship?\n\nQuestion background:\nVetoGate Egypt: [Ashraf Sobhi discusses hosting the 2026 World Cup with the President of the International Traditional Karate Federation](https://www.vetogate.com/5400045)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the International Traditional Karate Federation announces that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nEgypt has a recent history of hosting major international sporting events. In April 2025, the country hosted the World Karate Premier League in Cairo, which involved 384 players from 67 countries.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
