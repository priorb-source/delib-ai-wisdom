    "review": "The three forecasts show strong convergence (1-3%), with all forecasters identifying essentially the same factors: the compressed timeline, lack of preparation signals, extreme political toxicity due to Ukraine, and logistical barriers. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the bipartisan condemnation aspect and goes slightly lower at 1%. Forecaster 3 adds valuable framing around neutral-venue precedents (Helsinki 2018) and base rates of presidential Russia visits, but arrives at the same 3% as my initial forecast. No forecaster has introduced genuinely new information - we're all working with the same evidence vacuum (no preparations detected) and same constraints (32 days, Ukraine war context, domestic opposition). The key disagreement is whether Trump's unpredictability justifies 1% or 3% probability. Forecaster 3's point about neutral venues capturing diplomatic benefits with fewer costs is well-taken - if Trump wanted a Putin summit, a neutral location would be the obvious choice.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find no compelling reason to update my forecast. All three forecasters have converged on the same core reasoning: this is extremely unlikely due to lack of preparation signals, political toxicity, logistical barriers, and the short timeframe. The range of 1-3% reflects genuine uncertainty about how to weight Trump's demonstrated unpredictability against these formidable obstacles. The difference between 1% and 3% is not meaningful at this level of improbability - both represent 'extremely unlikely but not impossible.' I remain at 3% because: (1) Trump has demonstrated willingness for surprise summits with adversaries; (2) the window is already open, not future-dated; (3) while politically catastrophic, a rushed visit is physically possible; (4) we cannot entirely rule out secret preparations. However, I acknowledge Forecaster 2's lower estimate is defensible given the extraordinary barriers involved. The neutral-venue argument from Forecaster 3 strengthens the case that even if Trump wanted a Putin meeting, Russia itself would be an irrational choice of location.",
