    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core pillars I used: massive January financing (including employee liquidity), no visible underwriter/leak signals, a very short runway, and uncertain IPO tape—all favoring No. Forecaster 2 leans a bit higher on the possibility of a surprise at the June Summit; Forecaster 3 counters that IPO plans are typically disclosed via formal filings rather than at conferences. The incremental argument I found most useful is Forecaster 3’s point that the Summit’s content and high-profile speakers likely center on partnerships/products, making it a less natural venue for an IPO plan. One nuance I’d add is the resolution criteria: only a public S-1 or a Databricks news/blog post counts; a confidential filing alone wouldn’t. That slightly lowers odds versus generic “IPO planning” chatter. Overall, their reasoning is solid and consistent with mine; the main difference is how much weight to put on a late-June public S-1 as a setup for a fall window and whether the Summit catalyzes any disclosure.",
    "rationale": "The dominant signals still point to No: abundant fresh capital and liquidity reduce urgency; lack of public underwriter selection or governance prep news is atypical for a near-term public S-1; and the remaining window is tight. The resolution sources further constrain pathways to Yes: a confidential submission won’t count unless Databricks explicitly posts about IPO plans on its news page, which is uncommon due to gun-jumping concerns. Counterpoints keeping the probability above a low single-digit: (1) a late-June public S-1 to position for an early fall listing is plausible, and (2) the June Summit could, in a low-probability scenario, be paired with a blog post about intent to go public or a public S-1. Balancing these, I make a small upward adjustment from 14% to 16%, acknowledging the narrow but real chance of a late-June filing or explicit blog announcement, while still weighting the strong inertia and recent financing. If the Summit passes with no signals, I would drop this materially.",
