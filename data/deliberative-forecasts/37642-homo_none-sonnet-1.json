    "review": "Both forecasters independently arrived at 25%, which is notably lower than my 35%. Their analyses are well-reasoned and highlight important points I may have underweighted. Specifically, they both emphasize that the 'pause' language is a particularly strong signal - not just a neutral stance, but an active decision to stop cutting after a cutting cycle. This suggests the Fed has assessed conditions and determined current policy is appropriate, which is a stronger contra-indicator than I initially considered. They also correctly emphasize that reversing course within 6-8 weeks would require the Fed to essentially admit their pause decision was premature, which creates additional institutional inertia beyond normal status quo bias. Their convergence at 25% despite independent analysis is informative and suggests I may have been too optimistic about the probability of a cut in such a short timeframe.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I believe my initial forecast of 35% was slightly too high. The key insight from both forecasters is that a 'pause' after a cutting cycle is a particularly strong signal of policy satisfaction, not merely a neutral wait-and-see stance. This creates additional resistance to near-term cuts beyond typical status quo bias. However, I don't think the probability should be as low as 25% because: (1) there genuinely is one FOMC meeting where action could be taken, (2) the Fed has demonstrated willingness to ease policy in the recent past, and (3) we lack current economic data that might reveal emerging weakness. Economic conditions can deteriorate within 6-8 weeks, and unexpected shocks, while unlikely, do occur. The convergence of two independent forecasters at 25% is meaningful evidence I should update downward, but not abandon my view that there's a non-trivial possibility. I'm updating to 28% to reflect the stronger status quo bias they identified while maintaining that the timeframe allows for potential policy action if conditions warrant.",
