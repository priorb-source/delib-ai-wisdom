    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Roughly 2–4 weeks (UMich preliminary May data typically releases mid-May 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (a repeat of April’s 50.8 or lower would resolve as No; tie counts as No).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Gasoline prices continue to rise into early May; another hot inflation print and hawkish Fed rhetoric dampen expectations for rate cuts; equity market volatility or negative geopolitical news weighs on sentiment. Result: May index at or below 50.8.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The April plunge was an overreaction/outlier and sentiment mean-reverts; pump prices stabilize or ease slightly; markets calm; news flow softens around inflation. Even a small bounce puts May above 50.8.",
    "rationale": "April’s preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment fell to 50.8, the second-lowest on record. Given typical month-to-month volatility and historical mean reversion after sharp drops, a modest rebound above 50.8 is more likely than further slippage to new lows. Only a small increase is needed to clear the threshold. Offsetting that, near-term headwinds remain: springtime gasoline price pressures, lingering inflation concerns, and the risk that hot data or hawkish Fed communication sustains pessimism. Without strong evidence of improving price sentiment at the pump or notably calmer macro headlines, a substantial rebound is not assured. My research assistant provided no additional information, so this is based on historical behavior of the series, current macro narrative, and the low bar to beat April’s level. Why not higher: risks around inflation, fuel prices, and sentiment momentum could keep the index flat-to-down, and a tie resolves as No. Why not lower: given how depressed 50.8 is historically, setting fresh lows requires materially worse news; sampling variability and regression to the mean both favor at least a slight uptick. What would move me up: early May indicators of easing gas prices, softer inflation expectations measures, risk-on equity tone, or more dovish Fed signals. What would move me down: further rise in gasoline prices into early May, another upside inflation surprise, equity drawdowns, or negative shocks that reinforce consumer pessimism.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
