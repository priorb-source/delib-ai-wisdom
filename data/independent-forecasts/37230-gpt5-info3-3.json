  "information": "Several market-moving events are scheduled for late April and early May 2025. Major technology companies, including Microsoft, Meta, Apple, and Amazon, are set to release their first-quarter earnings reports. In total, over 180 S&P 500 companies are expected to report. Key economic data releases are also imminent, including the report on first-quarter GDP growth, the Personal Consumer Expenditures (PCE) inflation gauge for March, the ISM Manufacturing Index for April, and the April employment report. The Federal Reserve's next policy meeting is scheduled for May 7.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month, until the S&P 500 close on Friday, May 30, 2025 (compared to the close on Wednesday, April 30, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — on average the S&P 500 closes higher month-over-month, and absent major surprises, a modest gain is the base case.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inflation and labor data come in hot (PCE, CPI, jobs), pushing Treasury yields higher; the May 7 Fed meeting sounds more hawkish or pushes cuts further out; a few mega-cap earnings or guidance disappoint; risk-off into month-end drives the S&P 500 to finish May below its April 30 close.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mega-cap tech earnings generally beat with solid guidance; inflation data are benign or cooler than feared; the Fed communicates patience without escalating hawkishness; yields ease or stabilize; buybacks resume post-earnings, supporting equities into month-end, and the S&P 500 ends May above the April 30 close.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: Historically, the S&P 500 is up in roughly 58–63% of months, with an expected monthly drift of about 0.5% against a typical monthly volatility near 3–4%, implying a direction-up probability in the mid-to-high 50s. May specifically is not reliably negative; the “Sell in May” effect is modest at best. That suggests a starting point around 56–60% for a Yes.\nEvent risk tilts: Late April/early May is packed with catalysts. As summarized by the research assistant, over 180 S&P 500 firms (including Microsoft, Meta, Apple, Amazon) report, key macro prints hit (Q1 GDP details, March PCE inflation, ISM Manufacturing, April jobs), and the Fed meets May 7. Also likely in mid-May is the April CPI. These events add two-sided risk. Valuations, especially in mega-cap tech, are elevated, which raises downside sensitivity to any disappointment or hotter inflation (rates higher-for-longer). On the other hand, resilient earnings, ongoing buybacks (many windows reopen after earnings), and still-firm economic activity provide support.\nWhy not higher: Sticky inflation risk and a potentially hawkish Fed reaction function could lift yields, pressuring multiples. Concentration in a handful of large tech names raises tail risk if guidance underwhelms. Any geopolitical flare-up or widening credit spreads would also weigh on risk assets.\nWhy not lower: The long-run drift is positive; earnings season often skews price action upward when beats outnumber misses; economic growth remains decent; and post-earnings buybacks can provide a bid. Absent a clear negative shock, a small monthly gain is more likely than not.\nUpdate triggers:\n- Upward revision: Early mega-cap results broadly beat with upbeat guidance; PCE/CPI/jobs come in cooler; the Fed signals no urgency to tighten policy further and keeps 2025 cuts on the table; 10-year yield stabilizes or falls. I’d move toward 60–65%.\n- Downward revision: Hot PCE/CPI or strong jobs reaccelerate inflation fears; the Fed guides more hawkishly on May 7; key tech names miss or guide cautiously; 10-year yield breaks higher with credit spreads widening. I’d move toward 45–50% or lower if multiple negatives cluster.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the S&P 500 index go up in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Times: [What Is a Bear Market? Are We in One?](https://www.nytimes.com/article/bear-market-stocks-tariffs.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the closing value of the S&P 500 Index on the final trading day of May 2025 is higher than that of the final trading day of April 2025.\n\nThe \"close\" values shown on the [history page of Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC) will be used.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral market-moving events are scheduled for late April and early May 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
