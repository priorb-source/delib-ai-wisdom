    "review": "The other forecasters raised important new information I hadn't considered. Forecaster 2 identified Trump's April 11, 2025 endorsement of Ricketts with a direct attack on Osborn - this is significant and materially changes the political environment. Forecaster 3 provided valuable context on Osborn's competitive 2024 performance (6-point loss, $14M raised) and his Working Class Heroes Fund PAC, which demonstrates organizational capacity. All three of us converge on key points: (1) exploring a bid is a serious step that often precedes announcement, (2) the timeline is tight with only 5.5 weeks remaining, (3) no concrete signs of imminent announcement exist.\n\nHowever, I find Forecaster 2's 40% slightly optimistic. While the Trump endorsement raises stakes, it doesn't necessarily accelerate Osborn's timeline - it might even cause additional deliberation. The most compelling evidence for a lower probability remains Osborn's own words: 'decide by early summer.' Meteorological summer begins June 1, but colloquial 'early summer' typically means mid-June onward. His 2024 campaign timeline (July 2023 announcement for November 2024 election) supports a June-July 2025 announcement for November 2026.\n\nForecaster 3's logic about exploratory-to-announcement timelines (typically longer than 1-2 months) is persuasive, and the lack of announcement mechanics (scheduled events, senior staff hires, FEC filings) suggests we're not in the immediate pre-announcement phase.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should modestly increase my forecast to acknowledge the new information. The Trump endorsement demonstrates the race is intensifying and real, which might create pressure for an earlier response. Osborn's competitive 2024 showing (only 6 points with $14M raised) suggests he has viable infrastructure that could enable a quicker decision. The exploratory committee itself is a stronger signal than I initially weighted - most candidates who explore do eventually announce.\n\nHowever, the fundamental timeline constraints remain decisive. With 38 days until June 1, and Osborn himself saying 'early summer,' the linguistic and temporal evidence points toward a June or July announcement. No reporting suggests imminent announcement plans - no scheduled events, no major staff hires leaked, no FEC activity. Exploratory committees averaging 3-6 months means an April exploration would typically yield a July-September announcement.\n\nThe Trump endorsement could cut both ways - it might cause Osborn to take more time to properly assess the heightened difficulty rather than rush in. I'm updating from 28% to 32% to reflect the seriousness of exploration and his proven 2024 capacity, while maintaining that his own timeline statement and the tight window make a pre-June 1 announcement more unlikely than likely.",
