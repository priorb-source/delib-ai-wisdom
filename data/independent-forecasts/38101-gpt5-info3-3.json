  "information": "Polling data from early 2025 shows fluctuating approval ratings for both leaders. A Morning Consult screenshot from early May reported Starmer at 36% and Ishiba at 29%, while other reports citing late-May figures placed Starmer at 28% and Ishiba at 32%. Earlier, a March 2025 Ipsos UK poll found that 30% of Britons believed Starmer was performing well, an increase of 7 percentage points. A YouGov poll from the same period showed Starmer with a 31% positive rating, his highest since September 2024. In April 2025, Starmer and Ishiba held a telephone call to discuss the economic impact of U.S. tariffs and agreed to cooperate on global issues.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Morning Consult late-May readings reportedly have Ishiba ~4 points ahead of Starmer, and ties resolve to No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Both leaders’ approvals remain near late-May levels (Starmer ~high-20s, Ishiba ~low-30s) or move in parallel; even a tie would resolve to No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starmer gets a modest rebound (policy wins, favorable economic/data headlines, successful diplomacy) while Ishiba slips a few points (economic pressure from a weaker yen, cabinet troubles, or negative domestic news), flipping the ordering by July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/status quo: The research assistant notes Morning Consult snapshots with a reversal across May: early May Starmer ~36% vs. Ishiba ~29%, but late May Starmer ~28% vs. Ishiba ~32%. Entering June, Ishiba appears narrowly ahead. With only a month to go and Morning Consult using a 7-day moving average, the default is that the current ordering persists. Additionally, ties resolve to No, which slightly tilts the base rate against a Yes outcome.\n- Volatility: The early- to late-May swing suggests these series can move several points within weeks, so a flip is plausible. But the window is short, and we only need relative ordering on/around July 1; a modest persistence advantage favors the current leader.\n- Why not higher: Starmer is presently behind, time is limited, and a tie is a loss for Yes. Without a clear, imminent driver for a UK approval uptick or a Japan downtick, the prior leans No.\n- Why not lower: Recent swings show the ordering can change quickly. Both leaders sit in a range (roughly mid-20s to mid-30s) where 2–4 point shifts are common. A small UK rebound or a minor Japanese dip could suffice to put Starmer slightly ahead by July 1.\n- What would move me upward: Evidence in early-to-mid June that Morning Consult shows Starmer rising and/or Ishiba slipping, narrowing the gap to ≤2 points; UK-positive or Japan-negative events (e.g., UK policy win with broad coverage; yen volatility or cabinet stumble in Japan) reflected in weekly trackers.\n- What would move me downward: Mid-June data showing Ishiba opening a >5 point lead; continued UK softness (economic or political setbacks) or Japan tailwinds; any indication that July 1 will capture a 7-day window already showing Ishiba clearly ahead.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nPolling data from early 2025 shows fluctuating approval ratings for both leaders.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
