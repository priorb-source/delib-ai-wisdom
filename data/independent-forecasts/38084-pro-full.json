  "information": "According to the resolution source, drought.gov, approximately 22.7 million California residents were living in areas of drought (classified as D1-D4) as of the week of May 27, 2025. The U.S. Drought Monitor map, which provides this data, is updated weekly. Earlier in the year, on March 25, 2025, the California Department of Water Resources reported that water storage at Lake Oroville was 86% full and the statewide snowpack was at 96% of the normal level for that date. Consequently, the State Water Project increased its water allocation forecast to 40% of requested supplies.\n\nIn late May 2025, the National Weather Service issued extreme heat watches and advisories for several inland regions of California, with temperatures forecasted to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center also forecasted higher-than-usual temperatures across much of the state for the summer of 2025. NOAA's outlook indicated that the ongoing drought would likely persist through the end of August, with an above-normal risk for significant wildfires from June through August.\n\nA late May 2025 weather forecast for the Bay Area noted a period of unusual weather activity, including a forecasted hot weather event followed by a sharp cooldown. The same forecast mentioned the potential formation of Tropical Storm Alvin in the Eastern Pacific. According to the report, this storm system could track northwest towards California and interact with a low-pressure system, potentially bringing widespread storm activity and rainfall. This was to be followed by a trough of low pressure from Canada, resulting in below-average temperatures and showers.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. As of May 27, 2025, approximately 22.7 million California residents are in drought, which is above the 20.0 million threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A significant and widespread rainfall event occurs in June, driven by the forecasted tropical storm system and subsequent low-pressure trough. This precipitation is substantial enough to improve conditions and reduce the number of residents in drought to below 20.0 million by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The forecasted tropical storm system either fails to materialize, misses California, or brings only minimal, localized rainfall. Hot and dry conditions, as predicted by NOAA for the summer, persist or intensify, keeping the number of residents in drought at or above the 20.0 million threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the current drought conditions and the near-term climate outlook. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the status quo; as of May 27, 2025, 22.7 million Californians are already living in drought conditions, 2.7 million above the question's threshold. With only one month until resolution, and with California entering its typically dry summer season, a significant reversal is unlikely without a major weather event. The NOAA forecast for a hotter-than-usual summer with persistent drought further reinforces this view.\n\nMy probability is not higher because of the significant uncertainty introduced by the short-term weather forecast. The potential for Tropical Storm Alvin to bring moisture and a subsequent low-pressure system to deliver widespread rain represents the most plausible path to a 'No' outcome. A sufficiently wet storm system could rapidly improve conditions on the U.S. Drought Monitor map.\n\nHowever, my probability is not lower because tropical storm remnants hitting California in June are relatively rare, and their rainfall impact is often unpredictable and localized. The long-range climate forecast for a hot, dry summer is a more reliable indicator than a specific storm track forecast a month out. Erasing a 2.7 million person deficit from the drought count in one month would require a truly substantial and well-distributed rainfall event, making the status quo the more probable outcome.\n\nI would update my forecast upwards (towards 90-95%) if meteorological models show the tropical storm fizzling out or tracking away from California. Conversely, I would update my forecast significantly downwards (below 50%) if the storm strengthens and its track to bring widespread, heavy rain to California's population centers becomes more certain.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the resolution source, drought.gov, approximately 22.7 million California residents were living in areas of drought (classified as D1-D4) as of the week of May 27, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
