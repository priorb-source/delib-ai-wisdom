    "review": "Both forecasters’ logic mirrors my prior view: sustained double‑digit Conservative leads since 2023, Liberal support stuck in the mid‑20s, and seat models translating that into a likely CPC majority leave vanishingly little room for a 172+ Liberal outcome. Useful additions they highlighted: (1) explicit confirmation that the House will have 343 seats (raising the majority bar to 172), which marginally hardens the path; (2) redistribution and regional constraints (Bloc/NDP) that cap Liberal upside even if the CPC softens; (3) practical update triggers (sustained Liberal national lead, Ontario/Quebec surges, 338Canada medians approaching ~160+). They also note campaign‑move tail risks and leadership-change scenarios, which I already incorporate. I didn’t see new evidence that would materially increase the probability; if anything, the 343‑seat point and redistribution effects slightly reinforce the low baseline.",
    "rationale": "Time horizon ~6 months. Baseline polling and model dynamics from 2023–2024 show the Liberals far from majority territory; reaching 172 requires a large, broad-based and sustained reversal: a national Liberal lead, strong Ontario (>45%) and Atlantic consolidation, and a Quebec rebound versus the Bloc—plus efficient vote distribution under a 343-seat map likely tilted marginally against them. Incumbency fatigue, cost-of-living salience, and multi-front competition (Bloc/NDP) remain structural headwinds. Tail risks (leadership change with a substantial favorability bounce; major CPC misstep) keep the probability above zero, but those would need to be unusually large and durable to move seat models’ upper tails beyond 172. I would materially update upward only with several weeks of independent polls showing a clear Liberal lead and seat projections moving the Liberal median into the 150–160s with nontrivial (>10%) majority probability. Absent that, the prior stands. Given the other forecasters’ inputs, the net effect is to slightly reinforce, not relax, the low odds. I therefore hold my forecast.",
