  "information": "In December 2024, AquaBounty announced it was ceasing fish farming activities, shutting down its last operational facility, and culling its remaining fish stock. The company laid off \"substantially all\" of its staff at the site. With production halted, there is no operating cash inflow. Management has acknowledged that its capital-raising efforts have been unsuccessful for over a year and has stated it is \"assessing alternatives\" for its Ohio facility.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 weeks (through June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no bankruptcy petition is filed by the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty closes an out-of-court asset sale (e.g., the Ohio facility) or secures a small bridge financing that extends runway into July or later; alternatively, it pursues a non‑U.S. or out‑of‑court wind‑down that does not involve a U.S. Bankruptcy Code filing by the parent before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cash on hand is exhausted in May/June, vendors or lenders tighten terms, and the board files a voluntary Chapter 11 (to run a 363 sale of the Ohio facility/IP) or Chapter 7 liquidation before July 1; or a secured creditor forces an involuntary filing that the company does not promptly get dismissed.",
    "rationale": "Evidence points to acute financial stress with a short runway: per the March 27, 2025 full‑year results and subsequent disclosures, AquaBounty ceased fish farming in Dec 2024, culled stock, and effectively shut its last operating site. Management has said capital raises have been unsuccessful for over a year and they are assessing alternatives for the Ohio facility. With production halted, there is no operating cash inflow and ongoing holding/G&A costs continue. This setup makes a bankruptcy‑assisted asset sale (or liquidation) a plausible path, especially if there are contractor liens or other claims on the Ohio asset that are best addressed via a Chapter 11 process. The key near‑term uncertainty is cash runway through Q2 2025: if cash lasts only into June, a filing before July 1 becomes more likely. That said, I place extra weight on the status quo: as of today no petition has been filed, and companies often manage to delay formal bankruptcy for weeks to months via small bridge financings, payment deferrals, or out‑of‑court sales. The resolution requires a U.S. Bankruptcy Code filing by the parent; a Canadian proceeding or an out‑of‑court wind‑down alone would not count. Why not higher: they could secure a modest bridge (even a few million) or execute an out‑of‑court Ohio asset sale that pushes any filing beyond July 1. Why not lower: operating cessation, failed fundraising, and likely short runway elevate the chance of a June filing, particularly if a 363 sale is needed to clear liens and maximize value. What would move me up: disclosures of retaining restructuring advisors/DIP lenders, vendor lawsuits/liens accelerating, notice of covenant/defaults, or guidance that cash runway ends in June. What would move me down: announcement of a signed asset sale (closing without Chapter 11), new financing, or credible guidance that cash runway extends past July.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill AquaBounty Technologies file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[AquaBounty Technologies Announces Full Year 2024 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603978/000160397825000012/aqb-20250327xex99_1.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn December 2024, AquaBounty announced it was ceasing fish farming activities, shutting down its last operational facility, and culling its remaining fish stock. The company laid off \"substantially all\" of its staff at the site. With production halted, there is no operating cash inflow.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
