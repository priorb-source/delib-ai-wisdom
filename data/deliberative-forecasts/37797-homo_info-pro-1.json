    "review": "All three forecasters agree on the central premise: the FATF black list has significant inertia, and the removal of North Korea, Iran, or Myanmar is extremely unlikely. The key point of divergence is the probability of a new jurisdiction being added. My initial forecast was low (3%), similar to Forecaster 3 (5%), focusing on the high bar for change. Forecaster 2 (15%) made a very compelling argument that I had not sufficiently weighed: the specific, known risk associated with a grey-listed country failing to meet its action plan. Their mention of the FATF's previous warning to Nigeria about potential 'next steps' introduced a concrete, process-driven scenario for a 'Yes' outcome, moving it beyond the realm of just unforeseen geopolitical shocks. Forecaster 3's point about Pakistan usefully reinforces the difficulty of blacklisting a country based on external political pressure alone, but it doesn't negate the internal process risk highlighted by Forecaster 2.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast based on the deliberation. My initial 3% probability was based on the view that a change would require a major, unexpected geopolitical event, as the institutional inertia is incredibly strong. However, Forecaster 2's analysis convinced me that I was underweighting a more mundane, yet plausible, path to a 'Yes' outcome: the escalation of a grey-listed country for non-compliance. The specific mention of the FATF's prior warning to Nigeria introduces a tangible risk that I had overlooked. While blacklisting remains a measure of last resort and the FATF's preference is always for continued engagement, this specific warning elevates the risk for the June 2025 plenary above a baseline 'black swan' probability. I do not believe the risk is as high as 15%, as this ultimate step is taken with great reluctance. However, my initial 3% is too low as it did not account for this specific, known risk. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast from 3% to 8% to reflect the slightly elevated chance of an addition to the list stemming from a failure to progress by a jurisdiction already under increased monitoring.",
