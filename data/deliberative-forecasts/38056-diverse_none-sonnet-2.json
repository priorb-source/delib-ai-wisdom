    "review": "The other forecasters raised important considerations that warrant updating my analysis. Forecaster 2 provided valuable matchup details I hadn't explicitly considered: Walker's significant physical advantages (8-inch height, 11-inch reach) versus his defensive vulnerabilities, and crucially, Murzakanov's inactivity since April 2023—potentially over 2 years of layoff by fight time. This ring rust factor is substantial. Forecaster 3's decomposition approach is methodologically sound and highlights the compounding uncertainty: they estimate only 10-15% probability of this specific booking materializing on UFC 316, which is notably more conservative than my original 55%. \n\nThe key tension is between the UFC Stats link's existence (suggesting some level of official planning) and the complete absence of confirmatory information. Forecaster 3's skepticism about booking probability seems well-founded—most imagined pairings don't materialize on specific cards months out. However, their 10-15% may be slightly too conservative given the Stats reference. Forecaster 2's 48% appears to underweight the booking uncertainty significantly. The resolution criteria's strict requirement (resolves No if Walker doesn't fight Murzakanov specifically at UFC 316) creates multiple failure modes that should lower the overall probability substantially from any conditional win probability analysis.",
    "rationale": "Revising my probability decomposition with updated estimates: P(scheduled for UFC 316) should be lower than my original 55%. Given the UFC Stats page exists but lacks any confirmatory announcements, press releases, or betting markets, I now estimate 40-45% (split the difference between Forecaster 3's conservatism and my original optimism). P(fight happens | scheduled) remains ~87% based on typical UFC withdrawal rates. P(Walker wins | fight happens) I now estimate at 45-47%, accounting for his physical advantages but also Murzakanov's power and Walker's defensive issues, with the critical ring rust factor after 2+ years tipping slightly toward Walker. \n\nCalculation: 0.42 × 0.87 × 0.46 ≈ 17%. This represents a meaningful downward revision from my original 24%, primarily driven by greater skepticism about whether this specific matchup will actually be booked for UFC 316. The lack of any confirmatory information beyond a Stats page is a stronger negative signal than I initially weighted. I'm not going as low as Forecaster 3's 5% because the Stats reference does provide some evidence of planning, but the compounding uncertainties justify a forecast in the high teens rather than low-to-mid twenties.",
