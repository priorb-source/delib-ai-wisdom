    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of this forecast: Libya's profound and persistent political fragmentation, coupled with the extremely short two-month timeframe, makes ratification highly improbable. Their analyses added valuable texture to my own. Forecaster 3's specific mention of the split between the Government of National Unity (GNU) and the House of Representatives (HoR) makes the legislative paralysis argument more concrete. Forecaster 2 introduced the recent focus on a Turkish trade deal as a specific, competing priority that is likely to distract political capital away from AfCFTA. Both of these points strengthen the case for a 'No' outcome. The only substantive difference between our analyses is the final probability, with both other forecasters landing at 5% while I was at 2%. This suggests they are weighting the small chance of a surprise political maneuver slightly more heavily than I did.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 2% was driven by the view that Libya's deep-seated political gridlock presents an almost insurmountable barrier to ratifying a major treaty in the next two months. The arguments from the other forecasters have reinforced this core belief. The specific examples of the GNU/HoR legislative impasse and the competing priority of a Turkish trade deal make the path to ratification appear even more fraught with obstacles than I had initially articulated. However, I must also consider the signal from the group. That two other forecasters independently arrived at 5% suggests that my 2% forecast might have been slightly overconfident in the impossibility of a 'Yes' outcome. While I find their upside scenarios (e.g., a 'quick win' for a minister) to be very low probability, I will adjust my forecast upward to account for the collective judgment and incorporate a slightly larger tail for unpredictable events, such as a symbolic gesture driven by external pressure or a sudden, temporary alignment of factional interests. I am increasing my forecast from 2% to 4%. This small adjustment reflects a deference to the group's slightly higher assessment of uncertainty, rather than a fundamental change in my view that a 'No' resolution is the overwhelmingly likely outcome.",
