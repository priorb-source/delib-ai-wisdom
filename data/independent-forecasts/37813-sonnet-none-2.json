    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days - the question covers June 2025, with outcome determined on or after July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - there is likely to be at least one cube-shaped UFO sighting reported",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes without any NUFORC reports describing cube-shaped UFOs, either because fewer sightings occur that month, witnesses report other shapes, or cube-shaped phenomena simply aren't observed during that period",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one witness reports seeing a cube-shaped UFO to NUFORC during June 2025, the report is processed and posted to their database by July 1st, continuing the pattern of occasional cube-shaped sighting reports",
    "rationale": "The key piece of evidence is that December 2024 had 6 cube-shaped UFO sightings reported to NUFORC, which was described as 'rare in the history of NUFORC.' This provides important context: (1) cube-shaped sightings DO occur and get reported, (2) they are infrequent ('rare'), but (3) even a rare month can have multiple reports. The question has a low bar - it only requires ONE cube-shaped sighting in June 2025, not multiple. If December's 6 sightings represent a 'rare' occurrence, I interpret this to mean that most months have fewer such reports - perhaps 0-3 typically. However, the recent occurrence of 6 in a single month suggests the phenomenon is ongoing and reports continue to come in. Given NUFORC's active operations over 50 years and 180,000+ total reports processed, they clearly receive steady report flow. For a binary question requiring just one cube-shaped sighting, I assess the probability as moderately favorable but not certain. My forecast is not higher because 'rare' suggests these don't happen every single month - there are likely some months with zero cube-shaped reports. It's not lower because December 2024's 6 reports demonstrate these sightings are actively occurring in the recent timeframe, and I only need one report to resolve Yes. I would revise upward if I learned that cube-shaped sightings happen most months, or if May 2025 data showed continued cube reports. I would revise downward if I learned December was a massive outlier and typical months have zero cube reports, or if cube-shaped sightings showed strong seasonality making June unlikely",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the National UFO Reporting Center report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a report of a sighting of a UFO/UAP shaped like a cube in June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nFor example, although rare in the history of NUFORC, the month of December 2024 [had](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202412) six sightings with a cube shape.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
