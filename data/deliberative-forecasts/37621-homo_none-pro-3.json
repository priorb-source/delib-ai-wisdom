    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. Forecaster 3's reasoning aligns very closely with my own, emphasizing the extremely short timeline and the NFL's procedural norms, which make a rule change before June 1 highly improbable. We both arrived at a 5% forecast based on these overwhelming factors.\n\nForecaster 2 arrived at a higher forecast of 15%, citing the strong support for a ban and the concerns of the NFL Competition Committee as factors that could potentially escalate into a late vote. While I agree these factors create pressure for a ban, I find the 15% probability too high. This forecast seems to underweight the immense institutional inertia against passing a major, on-field rule change outside the established offseason window (the March Annual Meeting). The support for the ban was not sufficient to pass the rule during that designated time, and there is no new catalyst to force an emergency meeting and a successful vote in the less than three weeks remaining. Therefore, I find this reasoning less convincing than the procedurally-focused arguments.",
    "rationale": "After deliberating with my peers, I am maintaining my initial forecast of 5%. The discussion has reinforced my conviction that the timeline is the single most important factor in this forecast. The deadline of June 1, 2025, is less than three weeks away, and the primary window for NFL rule changes—the Annual League Meeting in March—has already passed. \n\nThe fact that the vote was tabled then indicates a lack of the required 24-owner consensus for a ban. For the league to schedule a special meeting, overcome the existing owner division, and pass a contentious rule change that would disrupt team preparations this late in the offseason would be highly irregular and unprecedented for an issue of this nature. The arguments presented by Forecaster 2 about existing support for the ban are valid, but that support failed to produce a result at the appropriate time. Without any news of a new meeting being scheduled, the path of least resistance is for the status quo to hold for the 2025 season. My 5% forecast accounts for the small, non-zero chance of an unexpected emergency session, but the procedural and temporal barriers make this an extremely remote possibility.",
