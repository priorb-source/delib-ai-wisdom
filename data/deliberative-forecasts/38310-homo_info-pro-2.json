    "review": "The other two forecasters presented crucial information that was not in my initial brief, fundamentally altering my assessment. Forecaster 2's point about President Zelenskyy's explicit public statement of acceptance ('And I will be') is the most impactful piece of evidence. It shifts the entire frame of the question from 'Will he decide to go?' to 'What could force him to cancel a public commitment?'. I found this reasoning extremely convincing. Forecaster 3 provided a strong specific motive for attending—lobbying for sanctions—and also corrected my understanding of the precedent. Their assertion that Zelenskyy attended the 2024 Italy summit in person, contrary to my initial report, establishes a much stronger pattern of recent in-person attendance. Both analysts correctly identify the same primary risks (battlefield crisis, security threat), but their higher confidence is justified by the stronger evidence they brought forward.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly increasing my forecast from 65% to 88%. My initial analysis was predicated on two key assumptions that have been effectively refuted during this deliberation: a mixed precedent for attendance and the absence of a firm public commitment. The information from the other forecasters has corrected my understanding. Zelenskyy's public acceptance of the invitation is a very strong signal of intent that dramatically raises the political cost of non-attendance. The status quo is no longer an open question but a clear intention to be there. Furthermore, if Forecaster 3 is correct that Zelenskyy attended the 2024 summit in person, it invalidates my 'mixed precedent' argument and instead shows a clear trend toward in-person attendance at recent summits. The specific strategic context regarding sanctions lobbying adds another powerful incentive. My updated forecast of 88% reflects this new, much stronger baseline, discounted by approximately 12% to account for the ever-present, high-impact risks of a major wartime military or security crisis that would necessitate his presence in Ukraine.",
