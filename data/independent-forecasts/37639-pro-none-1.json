    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "47 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Mahmoud Khalil remains in the United States, likely in detention, as his legal challenge against his detention and potential deportation proceeds through the US court system.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Mr. Khalil's legal challenge, or subsequent appeals, are not fully resolved by the courts before July 1, 2025. Alternatively, if a final order of removal is issued, the logistical process of arranging the deportation is not completed within the timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The court system rapidly issues a final, non-appealable decision against Mr. Khalil's challenge. Following this, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) prioritizes his case, quickly obtains necessary travel documents, and physically removes him from US territory before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the significant inertia and slow pace of the US legal and immigration systems. The key information is that Mr. Khalil has an active legal challenge to his detention. Such proceedings, including potential appeals, rarely conclude and result in an executed deportation within a short 47-day timeframe. The status quo is that he is in the US fighting his case, and this is the most likely state to persist in the short term. My research assistant provided no information suggesting the case is at its final stage or that deportation is imminent, reinforcing the assumption of a standard, slow-moving process. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because a swift and final court ruling against him, followed by an unusually expedited removal by ICE, remains a possibility, however remote. The specifics of his case are unknown, and it could be at a procedural stage where a quick resolution is possible. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 5% because this would underweight the standard delays inherent in the system. For a deportation to occur, his legal case must be fully and finally resolved, and the separate logistical process of removal must be completed. This dual requirement makes a 'Yes' outcome highly improbable in under two months.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon receiving news that a final court has ruled against him and denied further appeals, or if there were official confirmation that his deportation has been scheduled. I would decrease my forecast if a court grants him a stay of removal or agrees to hear a new, lengthy appeal.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mahmoud Khalil be deported before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mahmoud Khalil's challenge to his detention moves forward]()\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the United States deports Mahmoud Khalil before July 1, 2025. For purposes of this question, \"deported\" means Khalil being transported out of the territory of the United States against his will.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
