  "information": "According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Inegi), Mexico's unemployment rate reached a historic low of 2.2% in March 2025. This was a decrease from 2.3% in March 2024 and 2.5% in February 2025. The total number of unemployed individuals was 1.4 million. The economically active population (PEA) was reported at 61.1 million, with a participation rate of 59.3%. In contrast, the informal labor sector accounted for 54.4% of the workforce, and the number of underemployed individuals—those needing to work more hours—rose to 3.9 million, representing 6.6% of the employed population.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a 0.3% economic contraction for Mexico in 2025, citing the effects of tariffs imposed by the United States on key Mexican products. The IMF also predicts Mexico's unemployment rate will increase from 2.8% to 3.8% during 2025. Separately, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) forecasts Mexico's economy will grow by 1.3% in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026, though these projections are conditional on the tariff situation. The U.S. has imposed tariffs of 25% on key Mexican products like autos, steel, and plastics.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has publicly rejected the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) prediction of a 0.3% economic contraction in Mexico for 2025. She stated that the economic models of the Ministry of Finance contradict the IMF's projection and that the government has a strategic plan, known as 'Plan México', to reactivate and strengthen the national economy. As part of this strategy, the president has called on commercial banks to reduce interest rates to promote economic growth.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The unemployment data for April 2025 is typically released by Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) in late May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The most recent data from March 2025 shows the unemployment rate at a historic low of 2.2%, well below the 3.0% threshold. The recent trend has been stable or slightly decreasing, so a continuation of the status quo would result in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The newly imposed US tariffs on key Mexican industries like automotive and steel have an immediate and severe effect. Major manufacturers announce significant layoffs in late March and April, causing a rapid spike in unemployment that pushes the rate to 3.0% or higher for the April 2025 report.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The economic momentum from Q1 2025, which led to a record-low 2.2% unemployment rate in March, continues into April. The impact of US tariffs is either absorbed by domestic demand or takes longer to filter through to the labor market, keeping the unemployment rate well below the 3.0% threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the strong momentum of the Mexican labor market leading into April 2025. The most recent and relevant data point is the March 2025 unemployment rate of 2.2%, a historic low. For the outcome to be 'No', the rate would need to increase by at least 0.8 percentage points in a single month, a very significant and rapid shock that is rare outside of major economic crises. The status quo provides a substantial buffer against the 3.0% threshold.\n\nI have considered the significant headwinds mentioned in the report, namely the US tariffs and the IMF's projection of an economic contraction and rising unemployment for 2025. However, these are macroeconomic forecasts for the entire year. The effects of tariffs and a broader economic slowdown typically materialize over several months or quarters, not abruptly in a single month. Therefore, while these factors increase the probability of a 'No' outcome in the medium term, their impact on the April data is likely to be muted. The Mexican government's stated intention to counteract these effects with 'Plan México' also provides a modest counterweight, though its immediate effectiveness is uncertain.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 85% because the US tariffs represent a genuine and recent economic shock. There is a non-trivial risk that key export-oriented sectors could react faster than anticipated, leading to a wave of layoffs large enough to cross the 3.0% threshold. The reported increase in underemployment also suggests some underlying slack in the labor market despite the low headline unemployment rate.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the starting point of 2.2% is exceptionally strong. The inertia of the labor market makes such a dramatic one-month increase highly improbable. The overwhelming short-term evidence points towards continued strength.\n\nI would lower my probability if high-frequency data for April (such as reports of mass layoffs in the auto sector) were to be released. Conversely, I would raise my probability if early indicators for April, like manufacturing PMI, showed unexpected resilience.",
