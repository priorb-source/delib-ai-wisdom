    "status_quo_outcome": "No — current conditions likely imply ≤51 listed direct destinations.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Regional security tensions persist and European carriers largely keep suspensions in place; MEA and Gulf/regional airlines maintain core routes but only a limited number of seasonal adds (e.g., a few Turkish leisure cities), leaving the total in the 35–50 range on flightsfrom.com by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "MEA plus regional/LCCs load a robust summer schedule: multiple Turkish leisure cities (AYT, BJV, ADB, TZX, etc.), Greek seasonal routes, Caucasus (EVN/TBS/possibly BUS), West Africa resumptions (e.g., ABJ/ACC/LOS), and several European resumptions (LHR/FRA/BRU/AMS/MRS/LYS). Combined, unique destinations exceed 51 by July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Beirut (BEY) is MEA’s hub and historically could support 50+ destinations in summer. However, since Oct 2023, many European carriers suspended BEY due to regional risk; tourism has been weak, and 2024–2025 tensions along the Israel–Lebanon border have persisted. Summer schedules are largely set by late May, so big last‑minute expansions are unlikely. A conservative, status‑quo‑weighted view is that MEA and regional carriers will sustain strong Middle East/Gulf/Iraq coverage (roughly 20–30 unique airports) plus a narrowed but nontrivial Europe/Caucasus/Turkey set (perhaps 15–20), which likely totals under 51. The main upside path is seasonal leisure: multiple Turkish coastal/cities, added Greek/Caucasus points, and any West Africa resumptions (diaspora demand) or resumed UK/German/French secondary cities. These could push the count over 51 if several materialize simultaneously. The cited articles point to weak tourism demand and disruption risks, consistent with a cautious stance. Research assistant: no additional info provided, so I’m leaning more on structural factors (conflict risk, airline insurance/operational posture, schedule lead times) and historical patterns. Why not higher: Persistent security/insurance constraints and subdued inbound tourism reduce the odds of broad European resumptions by July 1. Why not lower: MEA’s hub role, resilient outbound/diaspora demand, and seasonal leisure to Turkey/Caucasus could materially lift the count. Updaters: I’d raise the probability if current flightsfrom.com already shows 48–50+ destinations, or if credible announcements confirm multiple European resumptions and Turkish/Greek seasonals; I’d lower it if further escalation triggers new suspensions or if current listings are only in the mid‑30s to low‑40s.",
