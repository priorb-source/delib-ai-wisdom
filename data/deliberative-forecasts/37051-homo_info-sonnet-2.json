    "review": "The other forecasters raised several important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2 noted that Harvard has filed a lawsuit, which adds another procedural barrier - courts routinely issue injunctions in such cases. They also pointed to concrete follow-through: the Trump administration has frozen $2.2 billion in funding, showing this isn't merely rhetorical. Forecaster 3 introduced crucial new information: (1) specific legal safeguards exist (IRC § 7217 and the 1998 anti-targeting law) that prevent politically motivated revocations, (2) the IRS is experiencing severe internal chaos with three acting directors in one week and workforce reductions, and (3) the IRS is 'reportedly making plans' with 'formal requests' for revocation proceedings. This last point is significant - it suggests institutional movement beyond mere political threats. However, I find their 4-5% forecasts somewhat high. While they acknowledge the same procedural barriers I identified, they seem to weight the political pressure and evidence of follow-through more heavily. The new information about IRS internal chaos actually reinforces the impossibility of rapid action - an agency with three acting directors in one week and reduced workforce cannot execute complex legal proceedings efficiently.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast upward from 1.5% to 2.5% based on the new information, but not as high as the other forecasters. The evidence of concrete action (funding freeze, formal IRS requests, IRS reportedly making plans) and Harvard's lawsuit filing are meaningful updates. However, the 67-day timeframe remains the decisive constraint. Even acknowledging unprecedented political pressure, the legal and procedural requirements are insurmountable: Harvard's lawsuit will almost certainly trigger preliminary injunctions; the specific anti-targeting laws and IRC § 7217 provide additional safeguards; the IRS's internal chaos reduces institutional capacity; and the standard revocation process involves multiple procedural steps that simply cannot be compressed into 67 days regardless of political will. The legal barriers (due process, administrative review, appeals) exist precisely to prevent rapid politically motivated actions. While I'm increasing my probability to account for the evidence of actual institutional movement and the unusual political environment, I remain convinced that completing a lawful revocation process by July 1, 2025 is functionally impossible.",
