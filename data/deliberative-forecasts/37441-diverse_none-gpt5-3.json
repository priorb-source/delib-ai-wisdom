    "review": "Forecaster 2’s logic aligns with mine: the required move (USD/EUR ~0.92 to <0.80) implies roughly a 13–15% swing in under two months, which is extremely rare without a major, US-centric shock. The timeframe emphasis and catalyst threshold are well framed. Forecaster 3’s 18% looks high. They appear to understate the needed distance (“5–10%”) and lean on arguments I find weak: (a) central bank intervention in EUR/USD is uncommon absent crisis; (b) “psychological barrier” at 0.80 is not a robust driver; (c) the tariff article doesn’t establish an imminent catalyst; and (d) base rates for >1.25 EUR/USD in such a short window are very low. Net, I don’t see new evidence to raise the tail probability above my prior.\n",
    "rationale": "Reaching USD < 0.80 EUR equates to EUR/USD > 1.25 on Yahoo’s EUR=X. From a starting point near 1.08–1.09 EUR/USD, that’s ~15% upside in ≈7 weeks. Post-2014, EUR/USD > 1.25 has been rare (brief in 2018). One- to two‑month implied vol is typically ~7–9%; a 15% move in this horizon is a deep tail absent a shock. The window counts “any point,” likely via daily high on Yahoo, which slightly increases the chance but not enough to overcome the distance/time constraints. Potential upside catalysts (US-specific financial stress, sudden dovish Fed pivot, acute policy accident) exist but are not currently evident; many global risk shocks historically support USD rather than crush it. Forecaster 2’s analysis reinforces my base-rate view; Forecaster 3’s higher probability relies on underestimating the required move and on weak intervention/psychological-level arguments. I therefore keep my estimate.\n",
