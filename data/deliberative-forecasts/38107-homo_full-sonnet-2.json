    "review": "Both forecasters provide strong analyses that align closely with my initial reasoning. Forecaster 2 makes an excellent point about credibility of sources - the claims of 'imminent indictment' come from InfoWars and political commentators like Flynn, not from actual prosecutors or DOJ officials making formal announcements. This is a crucial distinction I should have emphasized more. Forecaster 3's higher 10% forecast gives more weight to political pressure and the possibility of aggressive DOJ action, arguing that one month is 'technically enough time' for rapid action. However, I find Forecaster 2's reasoning more compelling: the investigation has already had weeks to produce charges without doing so, and the sources predicting imminent action lack credibility. The absence of any formal legal steps (charges, warrants, subpoenas) after several weeks is a strong negative signal. Forecaster 3's concern about a hostile political environment is valid, but political pressure hasn't translated into concrete legal action yet. The key insight from this deliberation is distinguishing between noisy political commentary and actual prosecutorial steps - we've seen lots of the former but none of the latter.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my forecast slightly downward to 4%. The decisive factor is Forecaster 2's excellent point about source credibility: predictions of imminent indictment come from unreliable sources (InfoWars, political commentators) rather than actual prosecutors or DOJ officials. This weakens the case for imminent action. Additionally, the investigation has now had multiple weeks without producing any formal charges, warrants, or subpoenas - this extended inaction is a strong negative signal. While Forecaster 3 correctly notes the hostile political environment, political pressure alone hasn't translated into concrete legal steps. The fundamental barriers remain: (1) First Amendment protections, (2) 2023 Supreme Court ruling requiring proof of subjective intent, (3) Comey's explanation undermining intent, (4) unprecedented nature of arresting a former FBI director, and (5) only 31 days remaining. The 4% probability acknowledges the technically possible scenario where DOJ moves with extraordinary speed under political pressure, but the lack of any formal legal action after weeks makes this highly unlikely.",
