    "review": "Both forecasters stress the short runway and South Sudan’s weak institutional capacity, arguing the status quo is sticky. They add two reinforcing points I didn’t foreground enough: (1) the seven-year lag since signing as evidence of consistently low prioritization, and (2) South Sudan’s poor track record on implementing regional commitments. I agree with their emphasis on multi-step bottlenecks and that the cited summit is not evidence of active ratification. I’m less certain it’s as low as 5% because last‑minute, executive‑driven ratifications do happen, but I accept my prior was a bit high given no concrete signals (bill tabled, cabinet approval, AU deposit prep).",
    "rationale": "Time is under two months for multiple steps (cabinet clearance if needed, parliament approval, presidential assent, and formal deposit with the AU). There is no public signal of an active process, and South Sudan’s governance constraints and crowded agenda (political transition, security, fiscal stress) reduce odds of coordinated, rapid action. A deadline effect tied to AU events could catalyze movement, but the firm July 1 cutoff limits the utility of any early‑July convenings. Ratification remains politically low‑cost and symbolically attractive, so a quick push is conceivable, but absent evidence of a bill in parliament or executive scheduling, that upside is limited. I’m updating down from 23% to 14% to reflect the stronger weight on persistent de‑prioritization and implementation track record over a very short timeline. I would move up quickly on credible reports of cabinet approval and parliamentary scheduling/passage or preparations for instrument deposit; I would move down if parliament goes into recess, new crises dominate the agenda, or June passes without clear movement.",
