    "review": "All three analyses converge on remarkably similar reasoning and evidence. We all identified the same key factors: the 57-day timeframe is very short, the net-cash position of several hundred million dollars with positive FCF provides crucial protection, no debt maturities exist before 2026, the Altman Z-score of -3.31 signals serious distress, nine consecutive quarters of declining revenue indicate fundamental business problems, and Q1 results on May 12 represent the key catalyst. The forecasts cluster tightly at 3%, 4%, and 8%, with the 8% forecast being the outlier. Forecaster 3's higher estimate doesn't introduce substantially different evidence or arguments - they simply appear to weight the distress signals slightly more heavily. However, I don't find this persuasive enough to warrant a meaningful update given the hard constraints: companies with substantial cash reserves and no immediate debt crisis simply don't file bankruptcy in 57 days absent a forcing event or revelation of hidden problems. The Altman Z-score predicts elevated risk over a 2-year horizon, not immediate filing. Even if Q1 results reveal deterioration on May 12, going from announcement to bankruptcy filing in the remaining ~50 days would be extraordinarily rapid.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I remain confident in my original analysis. The consensus between Forecaster 2 (3%) and myself (4%) reflects the appropriate weighting of evidence. The critical protective factors - several hundred million in net cash, positive free cash flow, no debt maturities before 2026 - create a strong buffer against bankruptcy in this extremely short 57-day window. While the Altman Z-score of -3.31 and nine quarters of revenue decline are genuine distress indicators, they signal elevated long-term risk rather than imminent filing. For bankruptcy to occur by July 1, we would need either: (a) Q1 results on May 12 revealing catastrophic hidden cash burn, followed by an exceptionally rapid board decision, or (b) unexpected hidden liabilities emerging. Neither scenario has supporting evidence. The ongoing strategic review exploring acquisition/privatization further suggests management is pursuing alternatives. I see no compelling reason to update my forecast based on the deliberation.",
