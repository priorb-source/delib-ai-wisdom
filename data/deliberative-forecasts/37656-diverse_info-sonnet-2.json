    "review": "Both forecasters raise critical legal and structural constraints I underweighted. Forecaster 3's point about advance appropriations through September 2027 is devastating to my original analysis - if CPB funding is already appropriated by Congress through 2027, the executive order cannot legally stop those funds under the Impoundment Control Act. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes the legislative timeline constraints and Republican opposition. The fact that CPB has filed suit (per Forecaster 3) further complicates immediate implementation. Both forecasters better explain why the tracker hasn't updated after two weeks: they're waiting for actual cessation of funding or legislative action, not just executive intent. However, Forecaster 2's 2% seems too dismissive of tail scenarios - there's still uncertainty about the tracker's exact standards, possibility of attachment to must-pass legislation, or creative administrative workarounds. Forecaster 3's 12% better captures this uncertainty while acknowledging the structural barriers.",
    "rationale": "I significantly overestimated the impact of the executive order by not fully accounting for appropriations law. The critical facts are: (1) CPB has advance appropriations through Sept 2027, (2) the Impoundment Control Act prevents presidents from refusing to spend appropriated funds, (3) CPB is actively litigating, and (4) the tracker hasn't updated despite the EO being signed two weeks ago. For 'complete' status by July 1, we would need either actual cessation of funding (legally blocked by advance appropriations and likely court injunctions) or Congressional action (extremely difficult in 6 weeks with filibuster rules and bipartisan opposition). The tracker's behavior - remaining 'in progress' for two weeks post-EO - strongly suggests maintainers require more than executive orders. My original 60% failed to account for these legal realities. However, 2% is too low given: (a) uncertainty about tracker standards, (b) small possibility of rapid legislative action via must-pass bill, (c) potential for administrative pressure causing partial compliance that tracker might credit. I'm updating to 10%, acknowledging this requires either unlikely Congressional action or the tracker accepting something short of complete funding cessation.",
