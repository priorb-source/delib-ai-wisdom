    "review": "All three forecasts cluster in the 60-68% range, showing good convergence. Forecaster 2 raises a useful point about summer months potentially increasing outdoor activity and sky observation, which I hadn't explicitly considered. Both forecasters make similar arguments to mine about the low resolution threshold (only 1 needed vs December's 6) and the uncertainty around baseline rates. However, I'm slightly concerned that Forecaster 2's 68% may be optimistic. The question's emphasis on December's 6 being 'rare in the history of NUFORC' - a 50-year history with 180,000 reports - suggests cube sightings are genuinely uncommon. If such a month is rare over 50 years, it implies most months have 0-1 cube sightings, with many months at zero. The summer advantage argument is reasonable but somewhat speculative - we don't have data confirming seasonal patterns for cube-shaped sightings specifically. Forecaster 3's reasoning closely mirrors mine, and their estimate of 0-2 as a typical monthly baseline seems plausible.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I maintain that the core tension is between: (1) December 2024's 6 cube sightings proving they are actively reported, and (2) this being described as 'rare in the history of NUFORC' suggesting most months have few or zero. The summer month argument raised by both forecasters is worth incorporating - June's better weather and longer daylight could modestly increase reporting. However, I'm cautious about overstating this effect without cube-specific seasonal data. The resolution requiring only ONE sighting (vs December's 6) remains the strongest argument for a probability above 50%. However, if December was truly rare (perhaps 95th percentile or higher), then the median month likely has 0-1 sightings, making the probability of at least 1 in June perhaps 50-65% rather than higher. I'll update slightly upward from 60% to acknowledge the summer observation advantage, but remain below Forecaster 2's 68% given the emphasis on rarity.",
