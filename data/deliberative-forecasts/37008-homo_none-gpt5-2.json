    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the default path (expiry on Apr 29) and the need for an active extension, plus the lack of public signaling as of Apr 21. I hadn’t weighted the “no signal -> default expiry” argument enough in my initial 60%. They also note a small tail for a different emergency leading to a Yes, which is a fair inclusion but low probability. Overall, their reasoning is coherent and highlights process/timing considerations that temper an automatic expectation of extension.",
    "rationale": "The baseline is No, since the existing order ends Apr 29 and an extension requires affirmative action. With nine days left and no credible indications (as of Apr 21) of ongoing severe outages or intent to extend, the odds tilt modestly toward expiration. Countervailing factors: energy crises can be sticky, and a very short extension into May would be administratively easy and consistent with Samoa’s prior practice during crises. There’s also a small chance of a separate emergency triggering a Yes. Balancing these, I move down from 60% to reflect the process/default and lack of signals, but keep it near coin-flip because the underlying issue may well persist and governments often act late on extensions.",
