    "review": "New points I hadn’t explicitly weighed: (1) a reported Trump endorsement of Byron Donalds, which would materially dampen Suarez’s near-term incentive to jump; (2) the lack of typical pre-launch signals (staff/vendor leaks, venue holds, donor invites) with <1 month to go; and (3) the idea that a competitive GOP field raises the bar for a credible, quick rollout. I find these persuasive and directionally consistent with my prior view. I agree that quarter-end optics could still spur a late-June press-release-style launch, but Florida’s political committee system reduces the necessity to announce before Q2 to raise money, so I put less weight on that incentive than Forecaster 3. Overall, Forecaster 2’s lower range aligns better with the evidence than Forecaster 3’s 25%.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is short (~26 days), and there are no visible signs of an imminent rollout. If the Trump endorsement of Donalds is correct, that further lowers the probability Suarez announces quickly, as it diminishes the perceived path and donor enthusiasm for a June launch. Suarez’s modest polling (5%) and his 2023 presidential bid baggage also argue for a longer deliberation period. While a pre–June 30 announcement could help with momentum narratives, Florida’s ability to fundraise via political committees without formally announcing weakens that pressure. Net effect: tilt down slightly from my prior 17% given the added headwind and lack of pre-launch indicators, while preserving some probability for a late-June, low-frills announcement to test the waters.",
