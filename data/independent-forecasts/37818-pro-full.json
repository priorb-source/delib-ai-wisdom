  "information": "The US government documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024. A notable concentration of these incidents occurred in Arizona, which has become a hotspot for sightings, particularly involving military aircraft. On January 19, 2023, a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet was hit by an object described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system' over Arizona, damaging the plane's canopy. This was one of 22 UFO sightings reported by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. Some US officials have suggested that the mysterious objects could be advanced drones used by foreign drug cartels for surveillance and smuggling operations.\n\nAccording to news reports, Florida ranks among the top three US states for total UFO sightings, with 8,623 reported cases documented by the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). On March 28, 2025, a US military aircraft encountered a large group of unidentified objects described as glowing spheres in the sky over Florida. A leaked audio recording of the pilot's radio conversation with an air traffic controller indicated the pilot saw several high-speed objects, experienced communication disruptions, and observed an unusual glow around the plane. A Lockheed AC-130 Spectre gunship was reportedly dispatched to the area in response to the incident.\n\nData from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) indicates that California has the most reported UFO sightings in the US, with 36,286 sightings since 1974. Following California in total sightings are Washington, Florida, Oregon, and New York. NUFORC's public archive shows approximately 100-150 pilot-flagged reports are logged nationwide in a typical year, which averages 8-12 per month. The distribution of these pilot reports is skewed, with California and Florida being the two most common states for such reports, followed by a tier including Arizona, Texas, and Washington. In March 2025, a US Air Force pilot in California reported seeing 'three orange-like lights' hovering above Los Angeles.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025, which is approximately 6 weeks from today's date of May 21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The baseline expectation is that another state, most likely California, will have an equal or greater number of pilot reports. With a very low number of total pilot reports nationwide each month, the probability of a tie for the highest number is significant, and a tie resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "In March 2025, Florida logs one pilot report from the significant military encounter. California also logs one report from the 'orange-like lights' sighting, and no other state has more than one. This results in a tie for the most reports, which resolves the question as 'No'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The significant military encounter over Florida in March 2025 was witnessed by multiple pilots who filed separate reports with NUFORC, resulting in a total of two or three reports for the state. Meanwhile, California and all other individual states log only one or zero reports for that month, leaving Florida as the state with the sole highest number.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the low-number-of-events nature of this question. The national average is only 8-12 pilot reports per month, making the outcome highly variable. Florida is a top contender, consistently ranking as one of the top two states for such reports along with California. The primary argument for 'Yes' is the significant multi-object military encounter reported over Florida in March 2025, which could have generated multiple reports from a single event. However, this is balanced by several factors favoring a 'No' outcome. California, the other main contender, also had a reported pilot sighting in March 2025. Most importantly, the resolution criteria states that a tie resolves as 'No'. Given the low counts, a scenario where Florida and California both have one or two reports is highly plausible. Therefore, the probability of a tie substantially increases the likelihood of a 'No' outcome. My probability is not higher because of the strong chance of a tie with California and the general randomness of report distribution. It is not lower because Florida is a clear top-tier state for these events and had a notable incident during the month in question. I would increase my forecast if evidence emerged that the Florida event generated multiple official reports. I would decrease it if more reports from March 2025 were confirmed for other states.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe US government documented 757 UFO sightings between May 2023 and June 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
