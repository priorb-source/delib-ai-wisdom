    "review": "The other two forecasters provided reasoning that was highly aligned with my own, focusing on the extremely short timeframe, the lack of preparatory signals, and the CEO's previously expressed reluctance to rush to an IPO in suboptimal market conditions. Both independently converged on a 7% probability. Forecaster 3 raised an excellent point that I had not sufficiently weighted: the restrictive resolution criteria. The question resolves only on an official action (an S-1 filing or a post on their own news blog), not on media reports or leaks. This is a crucial distinction. A news report might surface quickly, but an official corporate filing or announcement is a much higher bar, requiring significant legal and communications review, making a rapid, un-telegraphed move even less probable.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 10%. After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast. The most compelling argument for this change is the emphasis on the strict resolution criteria. My initial 10% was a general assessment of an announcement being made, and I hadn't fully internalized that a mere credible leak from a source like Bloomberg would not trigger a 'Yes' resolution. It must be a formal S-1 filing or an official company blog post. This significantly raises the barrier for a 'Yes' outcome within the very tight ~5-week window. Such formal actions are the culmination of a long process and are rarely rushed without any prior signaling. The consensus around a lower number also gives me cause to reconsider the slight optimism in my initial forecast. I agree with the other forecasters that the combination of the short timeline, the CEO's demonstrated patience, and the lack of any public signals makes the 'No' outcome highly probable. The restrictive resolution mechanics are the final piece of evidence that convinces me to adjust downward.",
