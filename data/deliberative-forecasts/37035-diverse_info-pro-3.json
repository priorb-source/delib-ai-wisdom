    "review": "All three forecasters agree that the status quo and historical precedent strongly favor a 'No' outcome. I found Forecaster 2's analysis particularly compelling. The key argument I had not sufficiently weighted was the specific historical precedent of the CDC's handling of previous, larger yellow fever outbreaks in Brazil (2017-18) and Nigeria (2019). In those cases, the CDC maintained a Level 2 notice, emphasizing vaccination rather than escalating to Level 3 ('Avoid Nonessential Travel'). This demonstrates a very high and specific threshold for escalating notices for vaccine-preventable diseases. Forecaster 3's point that the CDC has been monitoring this specific Colombian outbreak for months without escalating further strengthens the case for inertia. My initial 8% forecast, while correctly identifying the direction, seems to have overestimated the tail risk by not incorporating this strong, specific historical data. Forecaster 3's probability of 18% seems too high and disconnected from the strength of their own arguments, which align with a much lower probability.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am lowering my forecast. The most decisive new information was Forecaster 2's citation of specific historical precedents where the CDC maintained a Level 2 notice during more significant yellow fever outbreaks. This provides a strong base rate suggesting that the primary CDC response to this disease is to recommend vaccination, not to advise against travel. The existence of an effective vaccine is a powerful mitigating factor for the CDC's target audience (travelers). Furthermore, as Forecaster 3 noted, the CDC has been observing this specific situation for months and has kept the notice at Level 2, indicating the current trajectory is not seen as warranting an upgrade. The combination of this strong historical precedent, the short ~5-week timeframe, and the fact that the outbreak remains concentrated outside major tourist hubs makes a Level 3 upgrade extremely unlikely. My initial 8% forecast gave too much weight to the general unpredictability of outbreaks. I am now updating to 4%, aligning more closely with Forecaster 2, to reflect the low probability of a rapid, catastrophic deterioration that would overcome the CDC's established pattern of response to yellow fever.",
