  "information": "Financially, Cuomo's campaign is supported by the New York Apartment Association, which plans to spend $2.5 million on his behalf. His campaign has also run ads targeting Hispanic voters, including a $100,000 ad buy related to the Puerto Rican Day Parade. In a recent debate, all nine Democratic candidates, including Cuomo and Mamdani, were united in their pledge to protect immigrants and maintain New York's status as a sanctuary city. In a separate strategic move, Cuomo announced the founding of his own independent party, 'Fight and Deliver', while remaining in the Democratic primary race.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~2–4 weeks (Primary is Jun 24, 2025; RCV/absentee tabulation and media calls typically finalize within 7–14 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Cuomo narrowly wins the Democratic primary after RCV transfers",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Progressives consolidate behind Mamdani late, he leads first-choice votes in key progressive districts and benefits from anti-Cuomo second-choice patterns to win the final RCV round",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cuomo holds a small first-round lead, other moderates are eliminated, and their second-choice votes break his way; his name recognition, funding, and targeted Hispanic outreach help him edge the final RCV tally",
    "rationale": "Timeframe and mechanics: We are ~2 weeks from the June 24 primary. NYC uses ranked-choice voting; outcomes often hinge on second/third-choice dynamics and can take about a week to call. Status quo: Available public polling (headline: Cuomo’s lead narrows) indicates Cuomo is still leading but with a tightening margin. With little time left, front-runners with money and name ID are modest favorites to convert narrow polling leads into RCV wins, barring late-breaking consolidation or scandal. Evidence and factors: - Resources and organization: Per the assistant’s report, Cuomo has significant outside support (NY Apartment Association planning ~$2.5m of spending) and targeted outreach (e.g., $100k Hispanic-focused buy around the Puerto Rican Day Parade). Late targeted spending can be impactful in a low-turnout June primary, particularly with older and moderate voters who tend to participate reliably. - Field fragmentation and RCV: A crowded progressive lane can fragment first-choice votes, which typically helps a better-known moderate front-runner in early rounds. If Cuomo is not broadly toxic for second-choices among moderate/centrist-leaning voters, he can accumulate transfers from eliminated moderates. - Risks pulling him down: Cuomo’s negatives (baggage from prior controversies) could suppress both first-choice support and second-choice acceptability, particularly among progressives. The creation of an independent party line (“Fight and Deliver”) could alienate Democratic primary voters who view it as a spoiler threat, and landlord-backed spending may energize opposition on the left. The headline that his lead is narrowing suggests the race is competitive and moving against him at the margins. What keeps the probability from being higher: - Narrowing polls and the possibility of late progressive consolidation behind Mamdani. - RCV uncertainty: Cuomo may be ranked last by many progressive voters, limiting his transfer gains. - Potential negative late news or attacks highlighting his baggage or the independent line could depress his vote. What keeps the probability from being lower: - He appears to be the current polling leader with high name recognition and strong financial muscle, which often matter most in the final fortnight. - Fragmentation among multiple progressive candidates increases the difficulty of consolidating an anti-Cuomo majority before the final RCV round. - Targeted outreach (notably to Hispanic voters) could yield efficient marginal gains where turnout is reliable. Key updates I’d watch to move the forecast: - Directional RCV-style polls showing second-choice flows (Cuomo gaining or losing among moderates; whether progressives are consolidating behind Mamdani). - Major endorsements with turnout machinery (e.g., large unions, influential local officials) and newspaper endorsements; any coordinated progressive consolidation. - Turnout/early vote signals by borough and demographic proxies. - Any late-breaking scandal/negative story for Cuomo or, conversely, a rival. Overall, with two weeks to go and given money, name ID, and a small but real polling edge, I lean slightly toward a Cuomo primary win but see substantial downside if progressive consolidation materializes and if his second-choice ceiling proves low.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Andrew Cuomo win the 2025 Democratic primary for New York City mayor?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Cuomo’s lead narrows as Mamdani gains ground in NYC mayoral race: poll](https://pix11.com/news/politics/cuomos-lead-narrows-as-mamdani-gains-ground-in-nyc-mayor-race/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
