  "information": "As of April 30, 2025, the official UN OCHA impact snapshot reported 295 UN staff fatalities in Gaza. Reports from late April cited UNRWA stating that 295 of its personnel had died since October 7, 2023. This number reflects a steady increase over time; a UN report on March 19, 2025, had stated at least 280 UN employees were killed, and an OCHA report cited on January 9, 2025, listed 263 UNRWA staff fatalities. Broader figures for humanitarian workers indicate a higher total toll; an OCHA report on April 23, 2025, stated that at least 418 humanitarian workers, including the 295 UN staff, had been killed in Gaza since the conflict began. A specific incident on March 23, 2025, resulted in the deaths of 15 humanitarian personnel, including staff from the Palestinian Red Crescent and one UN staff member.\n\nThe United Nations has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, exacerbated by a blockade that severely restricts access to aid, food, water, and medical supplies. In early May 2025, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher called the aid blockade a form of 'cruel collective punishment,' noting that over 3,000 aid trucks were stalled at the border. According to OCHA reports from late April and early May 2025, insecurity and access restrictions have compelled humanitarian organizations to close nutrition centers. The same reports indicated an 80% rise in children being treated for malnutrition and that 65% of residents lack access to clean drinking water. The UN Population Fund also announced it had exhausted its supply of emergency shelter materials and hygiene products.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Israel's security cabinet reportedly approved a plan to intensify military operations in the Gaza Strip. This follows a period of renewed violence since a ceasefire broke down in mid-March 2025. The UN has described Gaza as one of the most dangerous places in the world for humanitarian workers, with its personnel and facilities at risk from military activity. The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has stated that humanitarian efforts are severely hindered by severe restrictions on movement within the territory. The International Red Cross also noted that the deteriorating security situation is hindering the work of its staff and partners.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two months. The outcome will be determined by the final UN OCHA impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip published before July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The rate of UN staff casualties has been consistent, with reported deaths increasing from 263 in January 2025 to 295 by the end of April 2025. A continuation of this trend, coupled with ongoing hostilities, makes it highly likely that the toll will increase by the 5 fatalities needed to reach the 300 threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would require a swift and sustained de-escalation of the conflict, such as a comprehensive ceasefire taking hold throughout May and June 2025. This would need to be effective enough to prevent any further UN staff fatalities, or at least limit them to four or fewer. This scenario would be contrary to recent reports of planned military intensification.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome is achieved if five or more additional UN staff deaths are reported before July 1, 2025. This scenario is highly probable given the current conflict dynamics. The threshold could be crossed through the steady accumulation of casualties at the recent rate, or through a single incident resulting in multiple fatalities, especially with military operations reportedly set to intensify.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on four key factors. First, the starting point is extremely close to the threshold; with 295 UN staff fatalities reported as of April 30, 2025, only five more are needed for a 'Yes' outcome. Second, the timeframe of nearly two months (May and June) provides ample opportunity for this small increase to occur. Third, the established trend of fatalities points strongly towards a 'Yes'. The number of reported deaths increased by 32 between January 9 and April 30, an average of over 8 per month. The more recent rate from March 19 to April 30 is even higher. At this established rate, the threshold of 300 would likely be crossed in May alone. Fourth, the current strategic context suggests an escalation, not a de-escalation. The report that Israel's security cabinet approved a plan to intensify military operations on May 5, 2025, makes a cessation of hostilities unlikely in the immediate future. The UN itself has described Gaza as one of the most dangerous places for aid workers. My probability is not higher than 95% to account for the small possibility of an unexpected, sudden, and durable ceasefire, or a significant lag in OCHA's reporting of fatalities. My probability is not lower because the combination of the low number of additional fatalities needed, the existing casualty rate, the long time-period, and the planned military escalation makes the 'Yes' outcome overwhelmingly likely. I would lower my forecast significantly only upon credible reports of a lasting ceasefire being implemented and observed by all parties.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025.
