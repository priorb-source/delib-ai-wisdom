    "review": "Both forecasters make a strong case to weight the most recent Morning Consult reading heavily given the short horizon and the resolution source. I agree that a 1-point status-quo lead with ~6 weeks left modestly favors Yes. Forecaster 3’s point about prior flips (Jan vs Apr) underscores that both series can move several points in a quarter, so a late flip is plausible. Where I diverge is on the tie-as-No asymmetry and Milei’s domestic headwinds: even small, noisy moves or rounding could yield a tie, which resolves No. I also note Sheinbaum’s domestic backdrop remains very strong, increasing the chance that MC drifts up or that Milei drifts down. On the other hand, Morning Consult has tended to rate Milei higher than many domestic polls, which supports some persistence of his lead and tempers a strongly No-leaning view. Net, their arguments nudge me a bit upward from my initial estimate but not above 50%.",
    "rationale": "I initially put Yes at 43%, emphasizing: (1) tie resolves as No, (2) Milei’s domestic deterioration, and (3) Sheinbaum’s robust domestic support suggesting upside risk for her MC rating. After considering the other forecasters’ points, I’m modestly updating upward to reflect: (a) the short time horizon and stickiness in MC’s tracker, (b) the current status quo advantage for Milei at MC, and (c) the observation that MC has historically shown Milei relatively high versus domestic polls, implying persistence is plausible. I still keep the forecast below 50% because the 1-point margin is within normal week-to-week movement and rounding could easily produce a tie (which resolves No), while Milei’s domestic sentiment and policy risks (e.g., protests, legislative uncertainty) lean against further gains. Update: 43% -> 48%.",
