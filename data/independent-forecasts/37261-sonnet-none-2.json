    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months remain until July 1, 2025. The question resolves based on protests reported by the Global Protest Tracker with start dates between the question launch and June 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. On any given day, the default outcome is that no protest of 10,000+ participants occurs. The status quo is the absence of such an event.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The United States proceeds through May and June 2025 without any major mobilizing events. Any protests that do occur either fail to reach the 10,000 participant threshold, or they occur but are not captured and reported by the Global Protest Tracker's methodology. The political and social climate remains relatively stable without major triggering incidents.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant political, legal, or social event triggers mass mobilization. Possibilities include: a controversial Supreme Court decision, major legislative action, high-profile police violence incident, immigration policy changes, labor disputes, climate activism events, or responses to international conflicts. Large urban areas like Washington D.C., New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago successfully mobilize 10,000+ participants, and the Global Protest Tracker documents this protest.",
    "rationale": "The United States has a strong recent history of large-scale protests. The 2017 Women's March, 2020 George Floyd protests, climate marches, and various political demonstrations have all exceeded 10,000 participants in major cities. This establishes that the US both has the capacity and cultural precedent for such mobilizations. However, several factors create uncertainty. First, the 2-month window is relatively short - while large protests can emerge quickly in response to events, they require specific triggering incidents. Second, the question depends on the Global Protest Tracker specifically documenting these events, adding a layer of uncertainty about their coverage methodology and reporting lag. Third, without information about current political developments or planned protests in May 2025, I must rely on base rates rather than event-specific analysis. The research assistant provided no additional information to influence the forecast. May and June are seasonally favorable for protests (better weather, end of academic year potentially increasing youth participation). The 10,000+ threshold is substantial but achievable in major US metropolitan areas. My forecast is not higher because: the 2-month window is limited, we lack information about specific triggering events or planned protests, and there's uncertainty about the Global Protest Tracker's coverage. My forecast is not lower because: the US has demonstrated capacity for large protests multiple times in recent years, the timeframe includes two full months where triggering events could occur, and multiple ongoing political and social issues could potentially mobilize large numbers. To update higher, I would need: information about planned major demonstrations, emerging controversial political events, evidence that the Global Protest Tracker reliably captures US protests, or data showing large protests occur more frequently than my base rate assumes. To update lower, I would need: evidence of particularly calm political environment, data showing the tracker has poor US coverage or significant reporting delays, or information that major mobilization efforts are not currently underway.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in the United States with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBrookings Institution: [The power of protest in the US](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-power-of-protest-in-the-us/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in the United States with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
