    "review": "Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 provide sound reasoning for why a 'No' outcome is likely, citing Donald Trump's absence from X, Elon Musk's pivot away from political commentary, their focus on other immigration policies, and their strained relationship. These are all valid and compelling points that I had also considered. However, both of their analyses appear to have missed the most critical detail in the problem description: the deadline for the tweet to occur was April 1, 2025, and the current date is May 22, 2025. They both frame their forecast as if the event could still happen in the future (e.g., Forecaster 3 mentions 'only about five weeks until the July 1, 2025 deadline, reducing the window for a triggering event'). This is a misinterpretation; the July 1 date is for resolution checking, not for the event itself. While their temporal reasoning is flawed, their arguments about the unlikelihood of such a tweet are still valuable. When applied correctly to the now-closed window of opportunity (before April 1), their points strengthen the conclusion that the event did not happen.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 5% to 1%. My initial reasoning remains the primary factor: the deadline for the event to occur (a tweet from Trump or Musk before April 1, 2025) has already passed. The probability is therefore overwhelmingly in favor of 'No'. The other forecasters, despite misinterpreting the timeline, provided a detailed analysis of why the base rate for this event was extremely low during the relevant period. Their arguments regarding platform usage, shifting priorities, and policy focus reinforce my belief that a tweet about the 'diversity visa' was highly unlikely to have occurred in the months leading up to the April 1 deadline. My initial 5% forecast included a buffer for the possibility that such a tweet did occur and was simply missed by the provided intelligence report. The detailed arguments from the other forecasters give me greater confidence that the conditions for such a tweet were not met, allowing me to shrink this uncertainty buffer. The remaining 1% accounts for the small possibility of a past, unobserved tweet being found during the final resolution check.",
