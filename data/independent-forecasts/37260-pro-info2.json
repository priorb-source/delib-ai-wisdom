  "information": "According to polling in late April 2025, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party had support from 25-26% of voters, making it one of the strongest parties in Germany. Internally, the AfD leadership delayed the release of its new foundational program from 2025 to 2027, with party insiders stating the reason was to avoid public debate on contentious issues and internal party conflict ahead of state elections in 2026. In the public sphere, demonstrations protesting the AfD and right-wing extremism were held across multiple German cities on May 1, 2025. Earlier, in February 2025, a rally in Hachenburg demanding a ban on the AfD drew approximately 1,200 participants.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The AfD remains a legal political party and is not banned by the German state.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The German political and judicial systems continue their deliberations, but the high legal and political hurdles for banning a party are not overcome within the short timeframe. No formal ban is announced by the Federal Constitutional Court before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unprecedented political crisis, likely triggered by the discovery of concrete evidence that the AfD is actively planning to overthrow the constitutional order, forces an emergency application to the Federal Constitutional Court. The Court fast-tracks its proceedings in an extraordinary manner and issues a formal ban before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly guided by the extremely high procedural barriers and the very short timeframe. The process to ban a political party in Germany is intentionally long and arduous, designed as a last resort and requiring a verdict from the Federal Constitutional Court. Historically, such proceedings have taken years, not weeks. The deadline of July 1, 2025, less than two months away, makes the completion of this process virtually impossible under normal circumstances. Furthermore, the AfD's significant public support (25-26% polling) makes a ban a politically explosive and high-risk strategy for the governing parties, as it could be perceived as anti-democratic by a large portion of the electorate and potentially strengthen the party's narrative of victimhood. The current Bundestag debate is a very early step and is far from a formal application to the court, let alone a final verdict.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 1% because an extreme, nation-shaking revelation (a 'black swan' event) could theoretically shatter normal procedures and force an emergency action, though this is a remote possibility. My probability is not higher because the institutional, legal, and political inertia against such a move within this timeframe is immense. For my forecast to increase, I would need to see a formal application for a ban sent to the Constitutional Court combined with a public statement from the court that it will handle the case with unprecedented urgency.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Germany ban the AfD before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nLe Monde: [Germany's Bundestag debates banning far-right AfD party](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/01/31/germany-s-bundestag-debates-banning-far-right-afd-party_6737637_4.html) \"A cross-party group of 124 MPs put a motion on the agenda to bring proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the party, whose unprecedented alliance with the CDU caused a shock.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is an official announcement of a ban on the Alternative for Germany (AfD) by a German government entity with the authority to make such an announcement (e.g., the Federal Constitutional Court).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to polling in late April 2025, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party had support from 25-26% of voters, making it one of the strongest parties in Germany.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
