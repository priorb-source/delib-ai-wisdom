    "review": "The other forecasters provided critical, specific evidence that I had completely missed. My initial analysis was based on high-level statements of intent, which I now see as aspirational rather than indicative of imminent action. Forecaster 2's points about the legislature's severe dysfunction (meeting only 32 days in six months), the empty May-June 2025 legislative calendar, the acute fiscal crisis from the pipeline shutdown, and the major political instability from the Vice-President's arrest are overwhelmingly convincing. Forecaster 3's point about the slow six-year ratification of the Maputo Protocol provides crucial historical context that reinforces the argument for bureaucratic inertia. These concrete data points paint a picture of a government with neither the capacity nor the political focus to ratify this agreement in the next two months. Their reasoning has completely changed my perspective on this question.",
    "rationale": "I am drastically revising my forecast downwards based on the compelling new evidence provided by the other forecasters. My initial probability of 65% was a significant error, rooted in over-weighting recent public statements by officials while failing to account for the profound operational and political realities in South Sudan. The new evidence shows that the government is facing multiple, severe crises: a dysfunctional and inactive legislature, an acute fiscal emergency, and a major political rift evidenced by the Vice-President's arrest. Furthermore, the fact that the AfCFTA agreement is not even on the published legislative calendar for May-June 2025 is a definitive piece of evidence against a 'Yes' outcome. The government's focus is clearly on the upcoming elections and managing the immediate crises. With less than two months to the deadline, overcoming this level of institutional paralysis and political distraction to fast-track a trade agreement is virtually impossible. The historical precedent for slow treaty ratification further reinforces this conclusion. The likelihood of ratification before July 1, 2025 is now, in my view, extremely low, dependent on an unforeseeable and highly improbable event.",
