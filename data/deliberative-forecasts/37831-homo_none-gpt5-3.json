    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: short window, entrenched authoritarian consolidation, diminished ECOWAS leverage due to AES alignment, and low institutional/court pathways for reversal. They add one useful emphasis: the technical ease of a reversal via a simple decree, which slightly increases the plausibility of a rapid, tactical U-turn if a shock occurs. They also explicitly note the 2024 suspension of party activity as a precursor, reinforcing the consolidation trajectory. No concrete new signals of pressure or backtracking were presented. I find their 8% reasonable but still a bit high absent evidence of imminent shocks (mass unrest, elite split, or binding financial conditionality).",
    "rationale": "Baseline remains that the junta has few incentives to reverse a high-salience control measure within ~6 weeks. External leverage is limited post-ECOWAS exit, and courts are unlikely to compel change. Domestic opposition faces repression and organizational hurdles, making a fast-moving crisis less likely. However, reversibility by decree and the inherent volatility of authoritarian politics justify a small tail for a face-saving concession to manage unrest or unlock aid. I’m nudging up slightly from 6% to 7% to reflect the ease-of-reversal point and allow a bit more weight on tactical U-turns despite no new concrete triggers. I would move up on credible reports of nationwide protests/strikes, elite fractures, or donor/WAEMU-linked financial pressure tied to restoring parties, or official hints of a June roadmap restoring party activity. I’d move down on further repression or explicit statements entrenching a party-less system through 2025.",
