    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments I had underweighted. Forecaster 2 highlights Florida's military training ranges and recent UAP incidents involving military pilots—a concrete advantage I missed. Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes that pilot reports per month are extremely few, making ties common and the tie-resolves-as-No rule particularly damaging to Yes outcomes. Both convincingly argue Florida is a top 2-3 contender rather than just one of 50 equal competitors, citing dense aviation activity, military presence, and Cape Canaveral launches. However, Forecaster 2's 25% may be too optimistic given the severe tie penalty and California's strength. Forecaster 3's 17% better balances Florida's structural advantages against the high randomness of low monthly counts and strong competition. The key insight is that with single-digit monthly pilot reports across all states, random clustering matters enormously, and ties at 0-2 reports are quite plausible.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast upward from 9% to 15%. My initial forecast was too pessimistic because I treated Florida closer to an average state rather than recognizing it as a top-tier contender. The evidence for Florida's advantages is strong: (1) extensive military aviation activity and training ranges that have featured in recent UAP incidents, (2) very high commercial and general aviation traffic, (3) rocket launches from Cape Canaveral that could generate pilot reports, and (4) coastal flight routes with good visibility. However, I'm not going as high as Forecaster 2's 25% because: (1) the tie-resolves-as-No rule is devastating when monthly counts are in single digits—a 1-1 tie is quite plausible and resolves No, (2) California remains a formidable competitor with comparable aviation infrastructure, and (3) with such low monthly counts, a single cluster of 2-3 reports in any other state could easily outpace Florida. The 15% forecast reflects that Florida is probably one of the top 3 most likely states but faces substantial structural disadvantages from the tie rule and high variance in rare events.",
