    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds concrete specifics I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: single production date (Feb 5), ~22,672 lbs, distribution to 10 states, Class I due to hard plastic, and only two complaints with no injuries. The single-day lot scope is a meaningful positive for timely closure. They also raise administrative lag in updating the FSIS page—a subtle but relevant risk given the resolution hinges on page status. Forecaster 3’s uncertainty about classification is addressed by Forecaster 2’s Class I detail; that aligns with typical handling for hard plastic. Both emphasize multi-state verification, expansion risk, and seasonality (late-spring/early-summer grilling) potentially surfacing more complaints—good considerations I only partially captured. Overall, their reasoning is sound and nudges me slightly upward due to the constrained lot and experienced firm, while retaining a non-trivial tail for delay/expansion and page-update timing.",
    "rationale": "We’re 34 days post-announcement with ~52 days until July 1 (total ~87 days). Base rates for similar FSIS foreign-material recalls, especially a single-day lot of moderate size and clear traceability, often close in 6–12 weeks if there’s no scope expansion and effectiveness checks proceed smoothly. Johnsonville’s experience and the absence of injuries favor timely closure. The added specifics (single production date, moderate quantity, 10-state distribution, two complaints) increase the likelihood that effectiveness checks and root-cause corrective actions are straightforward.\n\nCountervailing risks remain: multi-state retail verification can drag; seasonal grilling could drive additional complaints that prompt expansion; and even if operationally wrapped, the FSIS page status might update slowly, which matters for resolution. There’s also generic tail risk from supplier-level findings that could widen scope. Netting these, the constrained lot and time remaining make closure before July 1 more likely than not, but not overwhelmingly so. I’m updating modestly upward from 63% to reflect the single-lot scope and lack of complicating signals to date, while reserving probability mass for expansion/verification/admin-lag risks.",
