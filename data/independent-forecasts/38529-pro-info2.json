  "information": "Andrew Cuomo has secured endorsements from several key groups and individuals. These include Luis Dávila Pernas, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico; Latin music star Marc Anthony; and several Orthodox Jewish communities, including the Bobov Hasidic movement, the Crown Heights community, and the Far Rockaway Jewish Alliance. In contrast, Cuomo's primary opponent, Zohran Mamdani, has received the endorsement of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 16 days until the primary on June 24, 2025, with results likely confirmed within a week after.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on polling information indicating he has a lead, the status quo is that Andrew Cuomo wins the primary.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Zohran Mamdani's momentum continues to build in the final two weeks, fueled by strong progressive turnout and effective attacks on Cuomo's past controversies. Mamdani successfully consolidates undecided voters and wins the primary.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Andrew Cuomo's coalition of moderate Democrats and key demographic blocs, supported by his endorsements, holds firm. He leverages his superior name recognition and campaign funds to fend off Mamdani's late surge and wins the primary.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on Andrew Cuomo's position as the current frontrunner so close to the election. The provided information notes he has a lead, and despite it narrowing, frontrunners typically have an advantage in the final stretch due to name recognition and established support. The endorsements from the Puerto Rican Democratic Party chairman, Marc Anthony, and various Orthodox Jewish communities, as noted by my research assistant, indicate a broad and potentially powerful coalition among key NYC demographic groups that are reliable voters. This base provides a solid foundation for victory. However, the probability is not higher because the trend is not in Cuomo's favor. Zohran Mamdani is 'gaining ground,' suggesting significant momentum. Mamdani's endorsement from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a major asset in mobilizing the city's influential progressive wing. Furthermore, Cuomo's high negative ratings stemming from the scandals that led to his gubernatorial resignation create a hard ceiling on his support and make him a uniquely vulnerable frontrunner. My forecast is not lower because overcoming a lead in the final two weeks is challenging, and Cuomo's campaign machine and financial resources should not be underestimated. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see new polling that shows Cuomo's lead stabilizing or expanding. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if new polls showed the race as a statistical tie or if Mamdani secured another major endorsement from a group like the New York Times or a major labor union.",

These include Luis Dávila Pernas, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico; Latin music star Marc Anthony; and several Orthodox Jewish communities, including the Bobov Hasidic movement, the Crown Heights community, and the Far Rockaway Jewish Alliance.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
