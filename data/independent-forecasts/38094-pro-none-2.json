    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month.",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "Senator Fetterman, despite media reports of friction with his party and some policy disagreements, continues to caucus with the Senate Democrats past the July 1, 2025 deadline. The political incentives to remain within the caucus, such as committee assignments and party resources, outweigh any personal or ideological desire to leave.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Senator Fetterman experiences a sudden and severe health issue that necessitates his resignation from the Senate before July 1, 2025. Alternatively, though far less likely, his reported isolation and anger could boil over into a dramatic and unforeseen decision to switch parties or become an independent who no longer caucuses with the Democrats.",
    "rationale": "The baseline probability of a sitting US Senator leaving their party's caucus within a one-month timeframe is exceptionally low. This strong status quo bias forms the foundation of my forecast. The provided articles, while highlighting Senator Fetterman's independent streak and reported isolation, also crucially note that he has explicitly stated he will not resign. This public commitment is a very strong signal against a 'Yes' outcome. The political incentives for him to remain with the Democratic caucus are immense, including maintaining his committee assignments, access to party infrastructure, and his political viability in Pennsylvania, which elected him as a Democrat. A voluntary switch is therefore highly improbable.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 2% primarily due to Senator Fetterman's documented history of serious health issues. While he has affirmed his fitness to serve, the non-zero possibility of an unforeseen and severe health event forcing his resignation remains the most plausible, albeit unlikely, path to a 'Yes' resolution. This tail risk is what elevates the probability above near-zero.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because there is no concrete evidence he is considering leaving the caucus. The issues described are related to personality, style, and specific policies, not a fundamental ideological break that would precipitate a party switch. Furthermore, the deadline is only a month away, which is an extremely short period for such a monumental political decision to be made and executed.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of him having discussions with Republican leadership, if he suffered a publicly known health setback, or if he publicly stated he was reconsidering his affiliation. Conversely, I would decrease the forecast as the deadline approaches without any such developments.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Senator John Fetterman cease caucusing with the Democrats before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Fetterman says he won’t resign, gets support from McCormick as article blowback continues](https://www.pennlive.com/news/2025/05/fetterman-says-he-wont-resign-gets-support-from-mccormick-as-article-blowback-continues.html) | [An isolated, angry Fetterman is yet another challenge for Democrats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/16/john-fetterman-senate-relationships/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, John Fetterman ceases caucusing with the [Senate Democrats](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/about-senate-dems/our-caucus) for any reason, whether because he switches parties, resigns, or any other reason.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
