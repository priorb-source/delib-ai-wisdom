  "information": "According to NOAA data cited in reports, the warmest May on record was in 2020 with a temperature anomaly of +0.95°C versus the 1901-2000 mean, followed by 2016 at +0.93°C. For the current year, preliminary data showed January 2025 was the hottest January on record, March 2025 ranked first or tied for first, and April 2025 ranked as the second warmest. The first three months of 2025 were the second-warmest first quarter recorded. The strong El Niño event that persisted from May 2023 to April 2024 has transitioned to a neutral ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) state.\n\nSeveral regional weather events were reported globally during May 2025. In Ahmedabad, India, the month was one of the coolest in recent years, with an average maximum temperature 3.3 degrees Celsius below normal due to record rainfall. In contrast, Europe experienced several heat events. On May 1, the UK recorded its warmest start to May on record with temperatures reaching 28°C. Scotland saw its hottest day of the year so far on May 13, reaching 25.4°C. On May 30, a heatwave in Brittany, France broke local heat records for May, reaching 31.1°C in La Noë-Blanche. In the United States, International Falls, Minnesota, recorded temperatures around +32°C in early May.\n\nThe U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center released an outlook stating that the summer of 2025 was expected to be 'overwhelmingly above normal' across the United States. The forecast indicated that nearly all states were favored to see a warmer-than-average summer, with the highest probabilities for extreme heat in the West and Southwest. The outlook also noted an increased risk of drought and wildfires. Separately, Roman Vilfand, the scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, stated that preliminary forecasts suggested 2025 could rank among the top three or five hottest years on record.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "NOAA typically releases monthly global temperature data within 2-3 weeks after month end. Since today is June 2, 2025, the official May 2025 ranking should be available by mid to late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on the exceptional warmth of 2025 so far (January hottest on record, March first/tied for first, April second warmest), the status quo suggests May 2025 will rank very highly, likely in the top 3 warmest Mays on record.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 ranks 2nd or lower if the global temperature anomaly fails to exceed the 2020 record of +0.95°C. This could occur if cooler conditions in regions like India (which experienced below-normal temperatures and record rainfall) offset the heat events in Europe and North America, or if other major land/ocean areas experienced near-normal or below-normal temperatures.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 becomes the hottest May on record if widespread heat events in Europe (UK, Scotland, France), North America (Minnesota), and other regions push the global land-ocean temperature anomaly above +0.95°C. The momentum from the exceptionally warm first four months of 2025 continues into May, despite the transition from El Niño to ENSO neutral conditions.",
    "rationale": "The evidence presents a strong but not overwhelming case for May 2025 being the hottest on record. Supporting factors include: (1) 2025's exceptional start with three of the first four months ranking in the top 2 warmest, indicating sustained global warming momentum; (2) notable heat events in Europe including UK's warmest May 1st on record and France's record-breaking May 30th heatwave; (3) extreme warmth in parts of North America. However, several factors introduce uncertainty: (1) The current ENSO neutral state, versus the El Niño conditions that contributed to 2020's record May; (2) Significantly cooler conditions in India with temperatures 3.3°C below normal; (3) The high bar set by 2020's +0.95°C anomaly; (4) Regional heat events don't always translate to global records; (5) The requirement for explicit 1st place, not tied for first. The status quo heavily favors a top-3 finish given 2025's pattern, but breaking the actual record requires exceptional conditions. Without the official NOAA data yet available, and given the mixed regional signals, I estimate a moderate-to-good probability. My forecast would be higher (75%+) if we had positive signals from all major regions or if 2025 showed even stronger momentum. It would be lower (35-45%) if May had shown more widespread cooling or if April had ranked lower than 2nd place. Key updates would come from: early unofficial NOAA estimates, additional regional May temperature reports, or patterns suggesting the 2025 warming trend is moderating.",
