    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 both lean on labor‑market inertia, which I agree is the dominant near‑term force. The new, material point I hadn’t incorporated was Forecaster 3’s claim that March 2025 printed at 2.2% on TE—if accurate, that implies an unusually large month‑to‑month jump (≈0.8 pp) would be needed to breach 3.0% in April, which is historically rare absent a major shock. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on multiple consecutive sub‑3% prints and the informal sector’s dampening effect also strengthens the status‑quo case. I remain a bit more cautious than Forecaster 3 because of (a) the strict <3.0% threshold and TE’s rounding/display conventions, (b) the possibility of tariff‑related weakness showing up first in manufacturing hubs, and (c) occasional monthly volatility. But the combination of a very low March base (if 2.2% is correct) and end‑of‑month timing makes a sudden breach less likely than I initially assessed.",
    "rationale": "Mexico’s unemployment rate has been persistently below 3% and typically moves gradually. Even with US tariffs creating headwinds, labor‑market adjustments tend to show up over several months via reduced hours/underemployment before large, broad layoffs. If March was indeed ~2.2%, getting to 3.0% in April would require an unusually large jump by historical standards. We are also at the end of April, and there’s no clear evidence of mass layoffs that would generate such a spike. The strict threshold and possible TE rounding keep me from assigning 90%+, but the strong buffer and inertia justify a sizable upward revision from my earlier 60%.",
