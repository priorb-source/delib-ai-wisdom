    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 13 days (through June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "All qualified hitters regress below .400 over the next ~10–14 games; ESPN’s default stats/leaderboard page (typically showing qualified players) lists no one at .400 or above on June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A current frontrunner (e.g., a star like Aaron Judge or a high-contact hitter) stays red‑hot and remains ≥ .400 through June 1 with enough PA to appear on ESPN’s leaders; or the resolver uses an ESPN stats view that includes non‑qualified players and a part‑timer remains ≥ .400 by June 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time and base rate: With ~13 days left, most players will add ~40–55 AB. Historically, it’s uncommon for any qualified hitter to be at or above .400 by June 1 in the modern game; examples exist (e.g., Chipper Jones 2008), but the base rate over the past two decades appears low single digits.\n- Current context: The linked article implies Aaron Judge recently reached .400. If at least one player is around .400 on May 19, that raises the chance versus the long-run base. However, maintaining ≥ .400 across the next ~50 AB is difficult due to regression and increased denominator; even a .330–.350 true-talent hitter needs an exceptional short run to finish June 1 ≥ .400.\n- ESPN page/qualification nuance: The question’s resolution cites “the ESPN baseball stats page.” ESPN’s default leaders typically show qualified batters. If qualification is required, injuries/rest could drop a borderline .400 hitter below the PA threshold by June 1, removing them from the page. If the resolver instead uses a view that includes non‑qualified players, the probability is meaningfully higher because part-time players can still be ≥ .400.\n- Status quo weighting: The typical outcome by June 1 is that no qualified hitter remains ≥ .400, so the base case is No. The existence of at least one live contender now lifts the probability, but not dramatically.\n- Why not higher: Sustaining ≥ .400 over ~200 AB by June 1 requires unusually strong performance for an extended period, and league-wide BA context remains depressed relative to historical high-BA eras. Qualification filters and potential missed games further reduce the chance.\n- Why not lower: We are close to the resolution date and at least one player was recently at/near .400, so a short run could plausibly keep someone at/above the threshold. Only one player needs to qualify for a Yes.\n- What would move me up: Evidence that on or near May 25 there is a hitter ≥ .400 with a robust PA count (e.g., ≥170 AB), or confirmation that the resolver will use an ESPN page that includes non‑qualified players.\n- What would move me down: By May 25, all leaders are ≤ .390, or the known frontrunners slump or miss time such that they fall below both .400 and/or ESPN’s qualification threshold.\n- Research assistant info: None provided beyond the prompt; forecast relies on base rates, typical ESPN presentation, and the article indicating a recent .400 BA for Judge.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if on June 1, 2025, any Major League Baseball player in the 2025 regular season has a batting average of greater than or equal to .400 according to the [ESPN baseball stats page](https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
