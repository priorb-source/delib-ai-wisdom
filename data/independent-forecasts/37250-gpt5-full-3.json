  "information": "The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation was unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to 'facilitate' his return. Subsequently, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the administration to explain its diplomatic efforts with El Salvador regarding his return and set deadlines for the government to provide information and documents. An earlier court-ordered deadline for Garcia's return of April 7, 2025, passed without compliance.\n\nThe Trump administration has publicly resisted the court orders. President Trump stated the case is 'in the hands of lawyers' but also claimed he 'could' have Garcia returned with a single phone call but would not, citing alleged MS-13 gang affiliations. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged the initial deportation was an 'administrative mistake'. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that if Garcia were to return to the U.S., he would be immediately deported again.\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador around March 15, 2025, and is being held in a maximum-security prison. The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, has publicly labeled Garcia a 'terrorist' and has stated that he will not be released or returned to the United States. U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to demand Garcia's release from prison, but reported that the U.S. embassy in El Salvador had not received instructions to assist in the matter.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (from May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — he does not return to the United States by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "El Salvador keeps Garcia in maximum-security detention; the U.S. administration continues to resist or slow-walk court orders; no U.S. travel/parole documents are issued; diplomatic engagement remains minimal or performative; July 1 passes without his physical entry into U.S. territory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under intensified court pressure (e.g., contempt, specific injunctive relief), DHS issues the necessary travel/parole documents and instructs CBP to admit him; the U.S. applies leverage (visa restrictions, aid conditionality, targeted sanctions) leading El Salvador to release or expel Garcia directly to a U.S. port of entry; he enters U.S. territory (even if immediately re-detained and re-deported, which still resolves the question as Yes). Alternatively, a sudden political decision by President Bukele to expel him to the U.S. to secure unrelated concessions.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the current trajectory is unfavorable. According to the research assistant: (1) The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled the deportation unlawful and ordered the administration to “facilitate” Garcia’s return; (2) a district judge set deadlines that have been missed, including an April 7, 2025 return deadline; (3) the administration is publicly resisting, with the President signaling unwillingness to comply and DHS indicating that even if he returned he would be deported again; (4) Garcia is held in a Salvadoran maximum-security prison, and President Bukele has labeled him a terrorist and vowed not to release or return him; (5) Senator Van Hollen’s intervention has not been matched by executive-branch action, and the U.S. embassy reportedly lacks instructions.\n\nThese facts imply two hard constraints within ~2 months: El Salvador must release/allow departure, and the U.S. executive must admit him (issue travel/parole documents and CBP clearance). Both governments are currently opposed. The Supreme Court’s “facilitate” language is weaker than a direct command to produce; the administration can claim efforts while being thwarted by El Salvador, blunting immediate judicial remedies. Contempt or coercive sanctions could raise the cost of noncompliance but often take time to bite. Garcia’s incarceration makes irregular entry effectively impossible. Given missed deadlines and entrenched political positions on both sides, the status quo heavily favors No by July 1.\n\nWhy not higher: simultaneous resistance from both governments, custody in a max-security facility, and a tight timeline make a return by July 1 unlikely. Why not lower: a unanimous Supreme Court ruling increases legal and reputational pressure on the U.S. government; Congress is paying attention; diplomatic leverage over El Salvador (aid, visas, sanctions) could trigger a rapid policy reversal; Bukele could pursue a deal or unilateral expulsion; and any brief admission to U.S. soil would satisfy the resolution, even if followed by immediate deportation.\n\nWhat would move me up: credible reports that (a) DHS/CBP have been ordered to issue parole/travel documents or the embassy has received clear instructions to assist; (b) the district court imposes concrete coercive measures (daily fines, specific performance orders) and the administration signals compliance; (c) El Salvador moves Garcia out of max-security, grants consular access, authorizes release/exit, or signals willingness to expel him to the U.S.; (d) evidence of U.S. leverage being applied (visa sanctions, aid conditionality) tied to this case. What would move me down: El Salvador files formal charges ensuring prolonged detention; U.S. courts accept the government’s “facilitation” efforts as sufficient without requiring production; renewed public statements from both governments doubling down on refusal; continued lack of embassy instruction into mid-June.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
