    "review": "My initial forecast of 95% was based almost entirely on my research assistant's report of news articles from early May 2025 stating Berkshire had increased its Domino's stake to 7%. This would definitively resolve the question 'Yes'. \n\nForecaster 3's analysis at 8% appears to be based on incorrect premises. They state that 'Berkshire Hathaway currently has no publicly disclosed stake in Domino's Pizza,' which directly contradicts the background information that Berkshire already holds 2,382,000 shares. Therefore, their reasoning for why Berkshire would not *initiate* a position is irrelevant to the question of whether they would *add* to an existing, substantial one. I have disregarded this analysis.\n\nForecaster 2's analysis at 15% provides the only meaningful challenge to my reasoning. They introduce two new pieces of information I had not considered: 1) Berkshire was a net seller of stocks in early 2025, and 2) a research report on Berkshire's increased stakes during the quarter did not mention Domino's. The 'net seller' argument is weak contextual information, but the absence of Domino's from a specific list of purchases is a significant piece of counter-evidence. It directly conflicts with the news reports I was provided.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am making a slight downward adjustment to my forecast. The analysis from Forecaster 3 was not convincing as it was predicated on factually incorrect background information. However, Forecaster 2 introduced a specific and relevant piece of counter-evidence: a report on Berkshire's Q1 purchases that apparently omitted Domino's. This forces me to weigh the credibility of two conflicting pieces of information: my report of news articles claiming a 7% stake versus Forecaster 2's report that Domino's was absent from a list of increased holdings. \n\nI still believe the specific, positive claim from a timely news report ('the stake was increased to 7%') is stronger evidence than a claim based on omission ('Domino's was not on this list'). Lists in such reports are not always exhaustive, whereas a specific claim about a 7% stake is less likely to be fabricated. Nevertheless, the existence of this conflicting report introduces a degree of uncertainty that was not present in my initial analysis. It raises the possibility that the news reports I saw were inaccurate, speculative, or perhaps referred to a purchase made after the March 31st cutoff. To account for this new, plausible counter-evidence, I am reducing my confidence slightly. I am not reducing it more significantly because I still assess my primary evidence as more direct and compelling.",
