  "information": "The most recent post on Virgin Galactic's News page was dated January 30, 2025. The post before that was from December 12, 2024. Over the 10 complete months leading up to May 2025, five months contained at least one post. There was a four-month gap in posts from August to October 2024, and a three-month gap from February to April 2025.\n\nVirgin Galactic announced it will release its financial results for the first quarter of 2025 on Thursday, May 15, 2025, followed by a conference call. The company's Q4 2024 earnings release on February 26, 2025, was not posted on the main News page, nor was the press release announcing the date for the Q1 2025 results. These communications were issued via the Investor Relations section and PR wires.\n\nThe company is in a flight hiatus, with no crewed flights scheduled until 2026. The next generation of spaceplanes, the Delta SpaceShip, began assembly in March 2025. Commercial flights for this new craft are planned to begin in mid-2026, with private astronaut flights following in the fall of 2026. According to a regulatory filing, Geode Capital Management LLC increased its stake in Virgin Galactic by 19.1% during the fourth quarter of 2024.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be definitively known on June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The company has not posted on its News page for the three preceding months (February, March, April 2025). The status quo is a continuation of this communications pattern through May.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic decides to publish an update on its News page in May. This could be a post about progress on the new Delta SpaceShip assembly, an announcement of a new partnership, or a summary of its Q1 2025 financial results to reach a broader audience.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current three-month silence on the News page extends through May. The company communicates its Q1 2025 financial results exclusively through its Investor Relations portal and PR wires, consistent with past practice, and no other operational or corporate milestones are deemed worthy of a post.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on Virgin Galactic's recent communication patterns and current operational status. While a simple base rate from the last 10 months shows posts occurred in 50% of months, the current context warrants a significant adjustment. The company is in a flight hiatus until 2026, which drastically reduces the primary source of news: spaceflights. More importantly, the most probable trigger for a news post in May, the Q1 2025 earnings release on May 15, has a strong precedent of *not* being posted on the main News page, with such information being relegated to the Investor Relations section. The company is already in a three-month posting gap, and similar multi-month gaps have occurred previously, making another month of silence plausible. My probability is not higher than 75 because there is a non-trivial chance that the company will make a strategic decision to post an update, perhaps on the Delta program, to maintain public engagement during this long quiet period. Corporate PR can be unpredictable. My probability is not lower because the lack of operational activity combined with the specific evidence that the main scheduled event of the month (earnings) will bypass the News page makes a 'Yes' outcome highly likely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe most recent post on Virgin Galactic's News page was dated January 30, 2025. The post before that was from December 12, 2024. Over the 10 complete months leading up to May 2025, five months contained at least one post.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
