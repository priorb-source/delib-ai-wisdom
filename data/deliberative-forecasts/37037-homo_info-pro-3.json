    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis seems to be based on a flawed premise not present in the provided background information—specifically, a new 'reciprocal tariffs' policy implemented in April 2025. The actual issue is a long-standing clerical error from 2018. While their conclusion of a high probability is plausible, the reasoning is disconnected from the facts of the case. Forecaster 3's analysis is much more aligned with the evidence and my own initial reasoning. Their argument hinges on institutional inertia, bureaucratic process, and the power asymmetry between the US and Lesotho, all of which are highly relevant. They frame the core problem well: betting against bureaucratic inertia on a very short timeline is unwise, especially for a low-priority issue. I find their reasoning very convincing, as it reinforces my own core assumptions but with a stronger conviction.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am updating my own. My initial forecast of 75% was based on the significant bureaucratic inertia demonstrated by the US government's failure to correct an acknowledged 'scrivener's error' for over a year. I reasoned that if it wasn't fixed in a year, it was unlikely to be fixed in the final month before the resolution date. Forecaster 3's analysis reinforces this view but with greater confidence, leading me to believe I was too optimistic about the chances of a last-minute correction. The fact that the US Trade Representative's office acknowledged the error and promised an 'expeditious' fix in March 2024, yet the error persists in April 2025, is the single most powerful piece of evidence. This year-long inaction strongly suggests the issue is of extremely low priority. Fixing it requires a formal, multi-step process culminating in a Presidential Proclamation, which is highly unlikely to be completed for such a minor issue in just over one month. Forecaster 3's argument makes me put less weight on the possibility of a correction driven by political embarrassment and more weight on the sheer force of institutional drag. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast from 75% to 85%, aligning with Forecaster 3's assessment of the overwhelming odds in favor of the status quo prevailing through the resolution date.",
