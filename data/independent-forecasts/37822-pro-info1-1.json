  "information": "In late April 2025, during a series of town hall meetings, Beto O'Rourke stated that he would consider running for the U.S. Senate if it aligns with the desires of Texas voters. Quoted in multiple outlets such as Fox News, The Hill, and Yahoo, he said, 'If it comes to pass that this is what the people of Texas want, that it's the highest and best use of what I can give to you, then yes, I will.' As of late May 2025, O'Rourke had not filed any formal candidacy papers with the FEC and no campaign infrastructure or exploratory committee was visible. He continues his work with the voter mobilization organization 'Powered by People,' which he founded in 2019.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beto O'Rourke continues to gauge support through his 'Powered by People' organization and public appearances but does not make a formal announcement of his candidacy before the July 1, 2025 deadline, choosing to wait until later in the year or deciding against a run altogether.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Spurred by positive feedback from his recent town halls and pressure from key donors to start fundraising early, O'Rourke forms an exploratory committee in early June and makes a formal announcement of his candidacy via a social media video and press tour before the end of the month.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the short timeline and the lack of concrete steps towards a campaign launch. As of late May 2025, with the July 1 deadline just over five weeks away, Beto O'Rourke has not taken any formal actions required to launch a major Senate campaign, such as filing with the FEC or establishing an exploratory committee. While his recent comments stating 'if... then yes' signal a clear interest in running, they are conditional and typical of a politician testing the waters rather than a definitive precursor to an imminent announcement. Major statewide campaigns require significant logistical preparation, and launching one from a standstill in under six weeks is improbable, though not impossible. The status quo is that he is not a declared candidate, and this is the most likely state to persist past the arbitrary July 1 deadline.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 15% because O'Rourke has explicitly and publicly opened the door to a run. This is a significant signal, and a wave of positive polling or donor encouragement could precipitate a faster-than-usual launch. \n\nMy forecast is not higher than 15% because there is a complete absence of the logistical groundwork (staffing, FEC filings, fundraising infrastructure) that typically precedes a campaign announcement. Furthermore, there is no pressing strategic need for him to announce before this specific early date, giving him ample reason to delay a decision until later in 2025.\n\nI would increase my probability forecast if credible reports emerge of O'Rourke hiring campaign staff, forming an exploratory committee, or filing FEC paperwork. I would decrease it if he issues a statement clarifying he will make his decision later in the year.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Beto O'Rourke announces his candidacy for US Senator from Texas before July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
