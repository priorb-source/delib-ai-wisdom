    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Reports of this specific nature (pilot, from Africa, on this particular database) are very infrequent, so the most likely outcome is that one will not occur in the specified month.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "During June 2025, no pilot flying in African airspace either observes a UFO/UAP or, if they do, they do not submit a report to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC). Alternatively, a report is submitted but not processed and published by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial, military, or private pilot observes an anomalous object or phenomenon while flying over an African nation in June 2025. They decide to report it to NUFORC, and the organization publishes the report, making it available at the specified link before the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the low base rate of meeting all the required criteria simultaneously. The outcome requires a convergence of four specific conditions: 1) a sighting by a pilot, 2) occurring over the African continent, 3) within the 30-day window of June 2025, and 4) being reported to and published by NUFORC, a specific US-based organization. \n\nThe primary barrier is the reporting channel. NUFORC receives far fewer reports from Africa compared to North America, likely due to lower awareness of the organization. Furthermore, pilot reports constitute a small fraction of total UFO/UAP reports globally. The intersection of these two factors—a pilot report from Africa—is therefore an extremely rare event in the NUFORC database. An analysis of historical data on the site suggests such reports occur, at most, a few times per year. This low frequency implies that the probability for any single given month is very low. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 7% because such events are not impossible. The provided background information notes a recent (January 2025) report from Rwanda, confirming that reports from Africa are logged by NUFORC. Additionally, the heightened global conversation around UAPs may slightly increase pilots' willingness to report anomalous sightings they might have previously dismissed. \n\nMy probability is not higher because there is no specific information to suggest June 2025 will be unusual. My research assistant found no additional information, such as scheduled rocket launches or military exercises in the region, that might increase the likelihood of misidentification and subsequent reporting. The status quo is that these reports are rare, and I am weighing that status quo heavily. I would increase my forecast if I learned of a recent cluster of pilot sightings in the region or if NUFORC began a specific outreach to African aviation organizations. I would decrease it if data showed a multi-year drought of any such reports.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
