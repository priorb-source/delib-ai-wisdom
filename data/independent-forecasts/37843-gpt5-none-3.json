    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discord continues preparations and possibly submits or maintains a confidential S-1, but does not make a public S-1 filing or a specific IPO-intent post on its news blog before July 1. The company targets a late-summer or fall 2025 IPO and times the public filing for July/August instead.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Discord publicly files an S-1 with the SEC in June, or posts a specific announcement on its news blog stating it plans an IPO (e.g., that it has publicly filed a registration statement) before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Timing window: There are only ~5–6 weeks left. Even for companies planning a 2025 IPO, the public S-1 often appears closer to the pricing window. If Discord is aiming for late summer or fall, a public S-1 in July/August would be more typical than before July 1.\n- Resolution mechanics: The question resolves Yes only with a public S-1 or a specific news-blog announcement. Many tech companies use confidential submissions under the JOBS Act, which would not satisfy the criterion, reducing near-term odds.\n- Evidence we have: The cited Ars Technica report (Mar 2025) says Discord is planning a 2025 IPO and has retained major banks—clear intent to go public this year. That increases the overall likelihood of a 2025 filing, but not necessarily by July 1. The research assistant reports no additional information indicating a public S-1 has been filed yet or that a specific blog announcement is imminent.\n- Market context and practice: While the IPO window has improved relative to the 2022–2023 lull, issuers still tend to time public filings to align with marketing windows and avoid thin summer weeks. A late-June S-1 is possible, but targeting July/August (for a September pricing) is common, which would miss this question’s cutoff.\nWhy not higher: Short remaining time, typical use of confidential filings, and common timing for late-summer/fall IPOs suggest a public S-1 by July 1 is not the base case.\nWhy not lower: Credible reporting of a 2025 IPO with named underwriters implies real momentum; filing in June to keep optionality for a July/August or early fall launch is plausible. A company might also choose to publicly file earlier to begin the comment process and market education.\nUpdate triggers:\n- Upward: Reputable reports of a target timeline that implies a summer IPO; reports of a public (not confidential) S-1 being imminent; indications that Discord wants to market before the mid-summer lull; SEC filing trackers showing a new public S-1; a specific teaser from Discord’s official channels.\n- Downward: Reports of delays (market volatility, regulatory or business issues), preference for a post-summer window, or signs the company will remain confidential until later in July/August.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
