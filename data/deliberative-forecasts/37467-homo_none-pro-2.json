    "review": "All three forecasters agree on the central dynamic: Beyond Meat's survival through the short ~53 day window depends on its cash runway versus its burn rate. My analysis and Forecaster 3's are nearly identical, resulting in the same 5% probability. We both emphasize that without an acute, unforeseen shock, the company's existing cash should be sufficient to last beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline. Forecaster 3 added a valuable and convincing piece of evidence that I had not explicitly stated: the company's significant debt is not due until 2027, removing the common catalyst of a near-term maturity cliff. Forecaster 2 arrives at a higher probability of 15%, citing the company's 'genuinely precarious' situation. While I agree the situation is precarious long-term, their 15% forecast implies a 1-in-7 chance of a catastrophic event forcing bankruptcy in the next seven weeks, which I believe is too high without a specific, imminent trigger like a debt payment. The lack of such a trigger, as pointed out by Forecaster 3, makes the arguments for a 5% forecast more compelling.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am maintaining my initial probability of 5%. The deliberation process has reinforced my original reasoning. The core of the forecast remains the extremely short timeframe; companies with months of cash runway, even while unprofitable, rarely file for bankruptcy in a seven-week window unless forced by an external event. The most compelling argument that emerged during deliberation came from Forecaster 3, who noted that Beyond Meat's major debt obligations are not due until 2027. This significantly lowers the risk of an imminent liquidity crisis, as there is no maturity wall forcing the company's hand before July 1. This new piece of information strengthens the case against a near-term filing and makes Forecaster 2's higher 15% estimate seem less likely. My 5% forecast continues to account for the non-zero tail risk of a sudden negative shock (e.g., a major credit line being pulled or a massive supply chain disruption), but the lack of a debt-related catalyst solidifies my view that this risk is low within the specified period.",
