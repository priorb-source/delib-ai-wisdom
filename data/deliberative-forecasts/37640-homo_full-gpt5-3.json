    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce key points I already weighed: short horizon, institutional inertia, NARA/FOIA/GSA processes, and the resolution-source nuance that a redirect/static page still counts as UP. New/useful additions: (1) the fiscal-year timing (July 1 is before FY rollover), which reduces the likelihood of a completed decommission by that date; (2) the prominence of Energy Star co-branding on products implying a transitional web presence; and (3) concrete technical signals that would precede a true takedown (DNS/NS changes, TLS expirations). Their risk set (symbolic shutdown, coincident outage, or checker-specific blocking) matches mine. Overall, their reasoning is consistent, evidence-based, and slightly strengthens the case for Yes.",
    "rationale": "My base view was that procedural friction and archival obligations make a hard domain shutdown within ~7 weeks unlikely, and that the resolution only requires energystar.gov to be responsive (a redirect/static notice suffices). The additional argument about FY2025 timing and widespread co-branding/transition needs modestly increases the likelihood the domain remains reachable through July 1. Risks remain: a politically motivated rapid DNS takedown to signal elimination, an operational outage coincident with the Metaculus check, or misconfigured WAF blocking the checker. But given precedent (EPA pages in 2017 became redirects/static notices), the low cost of keeping the domain responding, and the short time window, the balance favors Yes. Accordingly, I nudge my forecast up slightly.",
