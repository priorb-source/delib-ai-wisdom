    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An acute liquidity crisis, triggered by an accelerated cash burn rate, the loss of a major customer, or a creditor demanding repayment, exhausts the company's cash reserves and forces its board to file for bankruptcy protection as the only remaining option.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an analysis of Beyond Meat's liquidity against its operational cash burn within the very short timeframe of this question. The company is demonstrably in financial distress, as evidenced by its significant and persistent operating losses, including the nearly $38 million loss in the most recent quarter. This indicates a substantial monthly cash burn. However, the primary factor for avoiding bankruptcy in the immediate term is cash on hand. Based on recent financial reports, Beyond Meat likely entered 2025 with a cash runway sufficient to cover operations for several months, extending beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline. The status quo outcome of continued operation is heavily favored in short-term forecasting, as a bankruptcy filing is a drastic final step that management will actively work to avoid. Given that less than two months remain until the resolution date, it is highly probable that the company can manage its remaining liquidity to survive this period, even if its long-term viability remains in serious doubt. My probability forecast is not lower than 15% because the situation is genuinely precarious. An unexpected event could trigger a sudden liquidity crisis and force a filing. My forecast is not higher because, absent such a crisis, the company's existing cash reserves should provide a buffer for the next seven weeks. I would increase the probability of a 'Yes' outcome if news emerged of restructuring advisors being hired or if recently-released quarterly financials revealed a catastrophic drop in cash reserves. Conversely, I would decrease the probability if they announced new financing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beyond Meat file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeyond Meat has had several years of losses and in the most recent quarter it [posted](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial) a loss from operations of almost $38 million.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Beyond Meat, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
