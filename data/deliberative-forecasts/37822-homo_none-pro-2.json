    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of this question. We all assign a low probability based on the very short timeline (~40 days), the lack of public signals of an impending campaign launch (staffing, leaks), and the strategic disadvantages of announcing a campaign more than 16 months before the election. The differences in our forecasts (10%, 15%, 20%) reflect minor variations in weighting these factors. I found Forecaster 3's point compelling that O'Rourke's established national profile and fundraising network lower the logistical barriers to a quick launch, making a 'surprise' announcement more feasible for him than for a typical candidate. Forecaster 2's point about another Democrat entering the race is also a valid consideration, though less likely to impact events before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am increasing my forecast slightly from 10% to 15%. My core reasoning remains the same: an announcement before July 1, 2025, is highly unlikely given the extremely short timeframe and the strategic logic that favors a later launch (late 2025 or early 2026). However, the deliberation, particularly Forecaster 3's reasoning, convinced me to give more weight to O'Rourke's unique ability to launch a major campaign with minimal advanced public preparation. His existing name recognition, national donor list, and media profile mean he could decide to run and announce it very quickly if he perceived a strategic advantage. While I still believe the strategic incentives point strongly toward waiting, this increased capacity for a surprise warrants a modest upward adjustment. The 5-point increase reflects this nuance without changing the fundamental assessment that an announcement remains a remote possibility.",
