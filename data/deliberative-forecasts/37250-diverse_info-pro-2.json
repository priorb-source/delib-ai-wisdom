    "review": "My initial analysis, which produced a 2% forecast, was based on a scenario where the primary obstacle was the intransigence of the government of El Salvador with little indication of U.S. government will to intervene. The analyses from Forecasters 2 and 3 introduce a completely different and more accurate framing of the problem. They both correctly identify the central conflict as being between the U.S. judiciary and the U.S. executive branch. The single most important piece of new information is that the U.S. Supreme Court has unanimously ruled Garcia's deportation unlawful and a district court is actively enforcing his return. This fundamentally changes the calculus and renders my initial forecast obsolete. Forecaster 2's analysis is particularly compelling, as it balances the immense power of a SCOTUS ruling against the clear evidence of executive branch inertia, demonstrated by the missed April 7 return deadline. Forecaster 3's focus on political resistance from the executive offers a valid reason for this inertia. Both analyses correctly highlight that the short two-month timeline is a critical factor that favors the status quo of delay.",
    "rationale": "I am substantially updating my forecast based on the new information provided by the other forecasters. The existence of a unanimous Supreme Court ruling ordering the U.S. government to 'facilitate' Garcia's return is the dominant factor and dramatically increases the probability of a 'Yes' outcome. The active oversight by a district judge, who is setting deadlines and can use tools like contempt proceedings, creates a powerful mechanism to compel compliance. However, this legal pressure is counteracted by significant executive branch resistance or inertia, evidenced by the fact that a firm April 7, 2025 deadline was already missed. The core of the forecast now hinges on whether the judiciary's escalating pressure can overcome the executive's delaying tactics before the July 1, 2025 deadline. Given the short timeframe, continued delays are a major risk to a 'Yes' resolution. I am moving my forecast up from 2% to 30%. This large increase reflects the paradigm shift from dealing with a foreign government to an internal U.S. constitutional conflict where the judiciary holds powerful enforcement tools. I am not forecasting higher than 30% because the missed deadline is strong proof that compliance is not simple or swift, and with less than two months remaining, the executive branch may be able to 'run out the clock' through continued bureaucratic or legal foot-dragging.",
