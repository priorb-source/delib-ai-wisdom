    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the key drivers of this question, leading to forecasts in a tight, low-probability range (10-18%). We all identified the same core arguments: the short two-month time horizon, the extremely high bar for a country-wide Level 4 advisory, the power of the status quo, and the fact that the State Department already employs a more nuanced system of designating specific dangerous regions inside Ethiopia as Level 4. Forecaster 2's specific comparison to countries like Syria and Afghanistan was a useful anchor for just how severe conditions must be to trigger a Level 4 designation. Forecaster 3 made a particularly convincing point about using U.S. Embassy operational status changes (e.g., an ordered departure) as a concrete, observable trigger, which is a very strong leading indicator for this type of advisory change. Both analyses reinforced that a nationwide upgrade would require a fundamental, qualitative shift in the security situation, not just an intensification of existing regional conflicts.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am adjusting my forecast downward from 18% to 14%. Their reasoning convinced me that I had likely placed slightly too much weight on the tail risk of a sudden security collapse and not enough on the bureaucratic inertia and the stability of the current, nuanced advisory structure. The fact that the State Department can already warn Americans away from the most dangerous parts of Ethiopia with regional Level 4 advisories makes a country-wide designation a much blunter and less likely tool. It would require a crisis that threatens the entire country, including the capital, to a degree that overwhelms this existing framework. While Ethiopia's security situation remains volatile, the other forecasters correctly point out that the bar for a Level 4 change over the next ~60 days is exceptionally high. Absent a clear and severe shock, like the U.S. Embassy ordering an evacuation, the current advisory is likely to remain in place. My new forecast of 14% still acknowledges the non-trivial risk of rapid deterioration in a fragile state but better reflects the high threshold for such a significant policy shift in a short timeframe.",
