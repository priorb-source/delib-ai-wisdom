    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months. The 2025 Canadian federal election is scheduled for October 20, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Bloc Québécois wins more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party. In the 2021 federal election, the Bloc won 32 seats in Quebec while the Conservatives won approximately 10 seats in the province.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party experiences a major surge in Quebec, possibly by capitalizing on economic concerns or capturing nationalist sentiment. Alternatively, the Bloc collapses due to Mark Carney's Liberal surge, with former Bloc voters splitting between Liberals and Conservatives, giving Conservatives enough seats to surpass the Bloc.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Bloc maintains its traditional support base in francophone Quebec regions outside Montreal. The party continues to effectively represent Quebec's interests and nationalist sentiment. The Conservatives remain relatively weak in Quebec despite potential national gains, as they struggle with Quebec's distinct political culture and competition from both Liberals and Bloc.",
    "rationale": "Historical precedent strongly favors the Bloc winning more seats than the Conservatives in Quebec. The Bloc is a Quebec-focused sovereigntist party with an established base in francophone regions, while Conservatives have historically struggled to make significant inroads in Quebec, typically winning only 8-12 seats. The referenced articles present competing pressures: Carney's Liberal surge could hurt the Bloc, but a Conservative candidate issue in Quebec City benefits them. However, the Bloc's main competition has traditionally been the Liberals, not the Conservatives. Quebec's political dynamics are distinct from the rest of Canada, with language, culture, and provincial autonomy playing major roles. Even during Conservative national victories, the party has struggled in Quebec. The status quo strongly suggests the Bloc will win more seats. I'm not forecasting higher (e.g., 90%+) because Carney's surge could substantially reshape Quebec politics and potentially benefit Conservatives indirectly. I'm not forecasting lower because there's no evidence of a Conservative breakthrough in Quebec, and structural factors favor the Bloc maintaining its advantage. I would update higher if polls showed the Bloc maintaining strong support, or lower if polls showed dramatic Conservative gains specifically in Quebec.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Bloc Québécois win more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Carney’s Surge in Quebec Could Wipe the Sovereigntist Party Off the Map](https://thewalrus.ca/carneys-surge-in-quebec-could-wipe-the-sovereigntist-party-off-the-map/) | [In Quebec City, a Conservative candidate cannot run and the Bloc is benefitting](https://nationalpost.com/news/in-quebec-city-a-conservative-candidate-cannot-run-and-the-bloc-is-benefitting)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Bloc Québécois party wins more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party of Canada in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election). If it wins the same or fewer seats, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
