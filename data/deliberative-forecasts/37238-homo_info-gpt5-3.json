    "review": "New information from Forecaster 3 is material: UFC 316 appears set for June 7, 2025 at Prudential Center (Newark, NJ) with O’Malley–Dvalishvili headlining. That’s a meaningful update versus my prior uncertainty on location and likely increases attendance odds due to proximity to Bedminster and DC and the presence of a star champion. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on base rates and the rarity of back‑to‑back appearances in close succession is a fair downward pressure. Both also highlighted early‑June presidential obligations (especially around June 6) as a key risk—an argument I hadn’t weighed enough before. Net, I find F3’s location/date/headliner specifics and proximity arguments convincing upward pressures, and F2’s scheduling/base‑rate cautions convincing downward pressures. I think F2’s 30% is too low given proximity and recent precedent; F3’s 42% feels close to my view, but with Newark known I still lean slightly higher than that while staying below 50%.",
    "rationale": "Updated factors: (1) Location/date now (reportedly) fixed: Newark, June 7. This is logistically favorable for Trump (near Bedminster and a short hop from DC). (2) Headliner O’Malley adds mainstream draw; Trump and Dana White value the publicity and have recently executed a successful arena appearance (UFC 314). (3) Base rate remains sub‑50 for any single PPV, even for a frequent attendee. (4) Early‑June presidential schedule risk (June 6 observances, potential travel) is the main downside; if he’s overseas on June 6, same‑weekend attendance is less likely. (5) Security/optics in Newark are manageable but not trivial; prior events (MSG/Miami) show feasibility. Net effect: relative to my prior 47% with unknown venue, Newark’s proximity nudges up; the back‑to‑back cadence and June 6 scheduling risk nudge down. I make a slight net trim to reflect the scheduling risk now salient, but keep the forecast near the cusp because proximity and precedent are strong. What would move me up: White House/Dana White hints, confirmation he’ll be at Bedminster that weekend, or added marquee co‑main. What would move me down: Confirmed overseas travel June 6–8 or a major domestic commitment that evening.",
