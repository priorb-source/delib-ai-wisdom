    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month, by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No UN member country newly recognizes Palestine in June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the Franco-British initiative, diplomatic negotiations face unexpected hurdles or are deliberately slowed due to intense counter-pressure from the United States and Israel. The involved countries decide to postpone the announcement to build a broader coalition or wait for a more strategically advantageous moment, pushing any potential recognition beyond June 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capitalizing on the momentum from their May announcement, France and the United Kingdom, possibly joined by other European nations like Slovenia or Belgium, issue a coordinated declaration in mid-June formally recognizing the state of Palestine. This action is framed as a necessary step to advance a two-state solution.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the single, significant piece of evidence provided: the Le Monde article stating the UK has joined a French initiative for the recognition of a Palestinian state. While the status quo is typically for no new recognitions to occur in any given month, this development represents a major break from that status quo. The involvement of two permanent UN Security Council members indicates a high level of political will and coordination, making a subsequent announcement in the near term highly probable. The May 20th date of the article suggests that an action in the following month, June, is a very plausible timeline for such an initiative to bear fruit.\n\nWhy the forecast is not lower: The signal from a coordinated Franco-British initiative is exceptionally strong. It suggests that the primary political decisions have been made and what remains is the diplomatic execution. This moves the needle far more than mere statements of intent from individual ministers. The recent recognitions by Spain, Ireland, and Norway have also created a 'permission structure' in Europe, making it easier for others to follow.\n\nWhy the forecast is not higher: International diplomacy is fraught with potential delays. A 100% certainty is impossible. Intense lobbying from allies like the US, unexpected domestic political crises in either France or the UK, or disagreements over the precise timing and wording of a joint declaration could easily push the announcement into July or later. The initiative was only announced in late May, leaving a relatively short window to finalize everything for a June declaration.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were official confirmations from the French or British foreign ministries specifying a June timeline. I would decrease my forecast if credible reports emerged of a US diplomatic push causing key European allies to hesitate, or if officials began speaking of a timeline stretching over 'several months'.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a UN member country newly recognize Palestine in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[UK joins France's initiative for recognition of Palestinian state](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/05/20/uk-joins-france-s-initiative-for-recognition-of-palestinian-state_6741456_4.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, a UN member country announces that it recognizes Palestine as a sovereign nation. Resolves based on Al Jazeera's [tracking page](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/10/mapping-which-countries-recognise-palestine-in-2025) or other credible sources should the tracking page not be timely updated.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
