    "review": "All three forecasters converged on similar probabilities (70-75%), indicating strong agreement on the core dynamics. Forecaster 2 emphasized that the 1.8-point gap is 'within normal monthly variation' and stressed sentiment volatility, suggesting the three-week timeframe allows for change. Forecaster 3 took the opposite view on timing, arguing 23 days is insufficient for major shifts without catalysts. Both noted the May preliminary-to-final upward revision and Conference Board improvement as moderating factors. The key analytical tension is whether to weight the small absolute gap (favoring lower probabilities) versus the strong downward momentum and structural headwinds (favoring higher probabilities). Forecaster 2's volatility argument is theoretically valid but doesn't account for the persistent negative trend over multiple months. Forecaster 3's catalyst-based reasoning is more compelling - sentiment reversals typically require specific events, and no obvious positive catalysts are on the immediate horizon.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain my 75% forecast. While both forecasters make valid points about the small 1.8-point gap and potential volatility, I weight the following factors more heavily: (1) The momentum is unambiguously negative across multiple months, not just short-term noise. (2) The structural headwinds (tariff uncertainty affecting 75% of consumers, 7.3% inflation expectations, weak ISM indicators) show no signs of near-term resolution. (3) While May showed a preliminary-to-final upward revision of 1.4 points, this still left the index well below threshold at 52.2. (4) The Conference Board improvement, while noteworthy, measures different aspects and hasn't prevented Michigan index deterioration. (5) Forecaster 3's catalyst argument is compelling - in 23 days, what specific event would drive a 3.5% improvement in sentiment? Trade deals take time to negotiate; inflation expectations don't shift quickly; Fed rate cut signals are unlikely given current inflation. The probability of staying below 54.0 slightly outweighs the possibility of a quick reversal, but not overwhelmingly so given the small gap and inherent uncertainty.",
