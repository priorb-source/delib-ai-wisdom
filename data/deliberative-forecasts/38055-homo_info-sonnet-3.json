    "review": "Both forecasters provided crucial information I lacked. Forecaster 3 revealed that Pyfer has an impressive 4-1 UFC record with 6 wins in his last 7 fights, including a recent Performance of the Night knockout - this completely changes the analysis from my information-limited initial forecast. Forecaster 2 added important context about Pyfer's technical advantages (grappling and reach) and that Gastelum fights southpaw. However, both also identified a critical risk factor: the fight was previously cancelled from UFC Mexico, and Pyfer withdrew due to illness. This creates legitimate concern about fight reliability. The temporal factor is significant - we're only 12 days from the event, which substantially increases the probability it happens compared to fights scheduled months out. Both forecasters properly decomposed the problem into P(fight happens) × P(Pyfer wins | fight happens). Forecaster 2 estimates this at 0.86 × 0.52 ≈ 45%, while Forecaster 3 estimates 0.75 × 0.60 ≈ 45%. The convergence around 45-48% across all three of us is notable.",
    "rationale": "Given Pyfer's strong recent performance (4-1 UFC, recent knockout, 6-1 in last 7), he appears to be a legitimate rising contender rather than an unknown quantity. This suggests he's likely a slight favorite or pick'em against the veteran Gastelum. While Gastelum has experience and recent wins, Pyfer's momentum and mentioned technical advantages (grappling, reach) tilt slightly in his favor. For the fight probability: being 12 days out substantially reduces cancellation risk compared to my initial uninformed assessment. While the previous withdrawal is concerning, rescheduled fights this close to the event typically proceed. I estimate 82% probability the fight happens. For Pyfer's win probability if it occurs: his recent form and technical advantages suggest 56-58% chance of victory. Combined probability: 0.82 × 0.57 ≈ 47%. I'm updating upward from my initial 45% based on the strong evidence of Pyfer's recent success and competitive positioning.",
