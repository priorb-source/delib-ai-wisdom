  "information": "A legislative proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Mike Collins, seeks to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery program. The act would also prevent visa lottery winners from sponsoring family members for permanent residence. The proposal has received support from conservative organizations such as Heritage Action and NumbersUSA, which argue that the program undermines national security and lacks a merit-based selection process. President Trump previously called on Congress to terminate the program in 2017, following a terrorist attack in New York committed by an individual who had entered the U.S. through the visa lottery.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About six weeks. The question resolves on July 1, 2025, and today is May 20, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Presidential actions are significant undertakings, and in the absence of a major focusing event, the default outcome over a short timeframe is that no specific action on this particular program will be issued.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "President Trump's administration prioritizes other signature immigration issues, such as border security, asylum reform, or changes to employment-based visas. They may support the legislative effort to end the Diversity Visa program (the SAFE for America Act) but choose to focus executive branch resources elsewhere, allowing the legislative process to play out. No presidential action specifically mentioning the 'Diversity Visa' is published by the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "As part of an early, aggressive push on immigration, the Trump administration issues a series of executive orders targeting various aspects of the legal and illegal immigration systems. One of these orders explicitly suspends or restricts the Diversity Visa program, using the required phrasing, framing it as a national security measure. This could also be a rapid response to a specific crime or terrorist event involving a visa lottery winner.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is 30%. While President Trump has a well-documented history of opposing the Diversity Visa program and a proclivity for using executive actions to enact his immigration agenda, the short timeframe of approximately six weeks makes a 'No' outcome more likely than a 'Yes'. The status quo is that such specific actions are infrequent.\n\nThe primary driver for a potential 'Yes' outcome is that this action aligns with Trump's long-stated policy goals and is supported by influential conservative groups. An incoming administration would have prepared a list of early executive actions, and targeting the Diversity Visa is a plausible inclusion. A high-profile crime committed by a visa lottery recipient would act as a powerful catalyst, almost certainly guaranteeing an executive response.\n\nHowever, the arguments for 'No' are compelling. A new administration, even one that has been planned extensively, faces numerous competing priorities upon taking office. Major issues like border control, economic policy, and foreign relations will likely consume the majority of the administration's bandwidth. The existence of the SAFE for America Act provides a legislative vehicle for addressing the issue, which the administration might prefer to support for a more permanent solution, thereby deprioritizing a concurrent executive action which would likely face immediate legal challenges. Furthermore, the resolution requires the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa', and a broader immigration-related presidential action might be issued that affects the program but fails to meet this specific criterion.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 30% because of Trump's established record and the symbolic power of taking action on this program for his base. It is not higher because the practical constraints of a short timeline, competing priorities, and the preference for a legislative path represent significant hurdles. \n\nI would increase my forecast if a specific triggering event occurs or if senior administration officials explicitly signal an imminent executive action on this topic. I would decrease it if the administration's stated focus remains entirely on other areas or if they publicly commit to a 'legislature-first' strategy for this specific program.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA legislative proposal, the SAFE for America Act of 2025, introduced by Representative Mike Collins, seeks to eliminate the Diversity Visa Lottery program.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
