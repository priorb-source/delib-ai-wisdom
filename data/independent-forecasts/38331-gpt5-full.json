  "information": "In May 2025, Pakistan restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban that was first enforced in February 2024. Internet monitoring organization NetBlocks confirmed that access was restored, allowing citizens to use the platform without a VPN. In a separate development, X blocked access to 126 accounts in Turkey in February 2025 following a court order citing the need for 'protection of national security and public order.' The blocked accounts included those of journalists and activists. In April 2025, a court in Ankara issued further access block decisions for several popular Turkish news accounts on the platform.\n\nThe Indian government ordered X to block access to over 8,000 accounts in May 2025, citing a crackdown on 'anti-India content' and violations of local regulations. The blocked accounts included those of several Turkish and Chinese media organizations, as well as independent media outlets and journalists. X stated its disagreement with the orders, noting that 'blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship... and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech,' but indicated it would comply while investigating legal options.\n\nIn early June 2025, the government of Tanzania blocked access to X. The country's information minister stated the ban was due to the platform hosting explicit sexual material, including pornographic and LGBTQ+ content, which he said was 'contrary to the East African state's laws, culture, customs, and traditions.' The move followed a recent change in X's policy to allow 'consensually produced and distributed' adult content. The Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC), a local rights group, described the action as part of a 'troubling pattern of digital repression' ahead of scheduled elections in October.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (until July 1, 2025; resolution on or after that date)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Between now and July 1, Wikipedia editors revise the page so that at least one of the seven countries (most plausibly Venezuela, or less likely Russia) is no longer listed as currently blocking X—for example, it’s reclassified as intermittent/partial, or there’s credible sourcing that access has been restored.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "No material change: the page continues to list China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela as currently blocking X, and no consensus edit removes any of them.",
    "rationale": "- Framing: The question resolves Yes only if all seven countries remain listed as currently blocking X on Wikipedia’s Censorship of Twitter page when accessed on/after July 1, 2025. Any one falling off the list yields No. \n- Status quo weight: Wikipedia already lists these seven as current blocks (per the prompt). Most of these regimes have long-standing, stable blocks with little near-term incentive to lift them. That favors a Yes by default.\n- Country stability assessment:\n  • Very stable: China, Iran, North Korea, Turkmenistan — blocks are entrenched; unblocking in the next few weeks is highly unlikely.\n  • Likely stable: Myanmar — post-coup controls persist; no signals of liberalization.\n  • Some risk: Russia — generally understood as blocked since 2022; while policy could shift or be reframed as partial, recent trends don’t suggest a sudden, sourced unblocking by July 1. Still, Wikipedia editors could nuance the status (e.g., partial/restricted) depending on fresh measurements.\n  • Highest risk: Venezuela — historically features intermittent, event-driven throttling/blocks rather than a continuous ban. Even if currently listed as “current,” editors might reclassify it to intermittent/episodic based on sources like NetBlocks/OONI. This is the main path to a No.\n- Wikipedia/process risk: The probability also reflects non-policy factors: editors updating the page structure, consolidating categories, or achieving consensus that changes how “current” is applied (especially for Venezuela, possibly Russia). Admins may annul in an edit-war scenario, but that’s stated as rare; I treat annulment risk as low.\n- Research assistant summary and impact: Pakistan’s restoration doesn’t affect the seven. Turkey/India orders concern account-level takedowns, not platform-wide blocks; they shouldn’t alter these seven entries. Tanzania’s new block may prompt editors to update the page broadly; such activity could incidentally tighten criteria for other entries (raising the risk that Venezuela is reclassified). Net effect: slight downward pressure on the “all-seven-still-listed” probability due to editorial churn risk.\n- Why not higher? Dependence on all seven persisting means the weakest link (Venezuela, secondarily Russia) dominates the risk. Also, Wikipedia classification changes can occur without a policy change on the ground if new sources are cited.\n- Why not lower? Five of the seven are extremely stable, and there’s no strong signal of imminent policy change in Russia or Venezuela before July 1.\n- What would move me upward? Fresh, credible measurements (NetBlocks/OONI) and talk-page consensus affirming continuous blocks in Russia and Venezuela through late June; low edit activity near the section.\n- What would move me downward? New measurements showing accessibility in Russia or Venezuela; credible reporting on policy relaxation; or active Wikipedia discussion suggesting a reclassification from “current” to “intermittent/partial.”",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn May 2025, Pakistan restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban that was first enforced in February 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
