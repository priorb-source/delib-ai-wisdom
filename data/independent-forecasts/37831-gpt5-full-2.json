  "information": "On May 13, 2025, Mali's military junta, led by General Assimi Goïta, issued a presidential decree dissolving all political parties and organizations. The government justified the decision by citing the need to rationalize the political landscape, which includes around 300 parties, and to preserve national unity and stability. The decree followed national consultations held in April 2025. Preceding the decree, the National Transitional Council (CNT) voted 130-2 to repeal the law governing the charter of political parties and the statute of political opposition. The government has stated its intention to draft a new legislative framework to regulate the political sector in the future.\n\nIn response to the dissolution decree, Malian political parties have initiated legal challenges, filing lawsuits in six courts in Bamako and a separate appeal to the administrative section of the Supreme Court. They argue the decree infringes on their rights to association, assembly, and participation in public life. On May 3, 2025, prior to the decree, hundreds of people attended a protest in Bamako organized by the parties. Following the decree, Malian intellectuals, including writers and lawyers, signed a statement denouncing the regime's actions. Reports indicate at least three opposition members have been arrested.\n\nThe international community has widely condemned the dissolution of political parties in Mali. The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Türk, publicly called on the Malian authorities to reverse the decision. Both Amnesty International and the United Nations have characterized the junta's actions as an attack on freedom of expression and association. The African Union (AU) has been called upon to mediate and support dialogue to restore democratic processes, in line with the African Charter on Democracy, Elections and Governance. This international pressure comes after Mali previously announced its withdrawal from the regional bloc ECOWAS.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (from 2025-05-22 to 2025-06-30)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The decree remains in force through June 30. Court challenges stall or are rejected; the junta signals that a new political-party framework will come “later,” without reinstating parties before July 1. Limited protests are contained; international pressure has little leverage given Mali’s posture and weak external enforcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The junta issues a new decree or law quickly reinstating parties (or a court annuls the dissolution and the junta complies), generally allowing existing and new parties to operate again before July 1—possibly framed as an interim measure pending a new legal framework.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Mali’s junta is consolidating authoritarian control and has progressively curtailed party activity (previous suspensions in 2024, now a May 13, 2025 dissolution). The CNT’s overwhelming vote to repeal party-governance laws (130–2) and the government’s stated plan to draft a new framework indicate intent to redesign, not promptly restore, party politics. Courts in Mali are unlikely to act independently and swiftly against a fresh, high-priority decree, and even if they did, compliance within the short window is uncertain. International condemnation (UN, Amnesty) and calls for AU engagement have limited immediate leverage; Mali’s withdrawal from ECOWAS further reduces regional pressure. Domestic opposition activity appears modest and is being repressed (arrests reported). With only ~5–6 weeks left, bureaucratic and political inertia favor the decree persisting past July 1. Why not higher: The junta’s incentives (control, manage transition on its terms), short timeline to draft and pass a new law, weak judicial independence, and limited external pressure make a near-term reversal unlikely. Why not lower: There are non-zero paths—legal challenges could produce a ruling the junta decides to respect; the regime might make a tactical, face-saving partial retreat (which would still qualify if general party formation is restored) to ease international pressure; or a surge in protests or an elite split could prompt a quick concession. What would move me up: Evidence of the administrative section of the Supreme Court fast-tracking and credibly challenging the decree; signs the junta is drafting and scheduling an interim reinstatement order; coordinated, large, sustained protests with signs of defections within security forces; AU or key partners leveraging material incentives/sanctions the junta cares about. What would move me down: Crackdowns on legal challengers, explicit statements doubling down on dissolution until a new framework “later in 2025,” or evidence that courts are sidelined and no legislative activity is scheduled before July.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
