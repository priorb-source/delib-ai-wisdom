  "information": "Polling data from early 2025 shows fluctuating approval ratings for both leaders. A Morning Consult screenshot from early May reported Starmer at 36% and Ishiba at 29%, while other reports citing late-May figures placed Starmer at 28% and Ishiba at 32%. Earlier, a March 2025 Ipsos UK poll found that 30% of Britons believed Starmer was performing well, an increase of 7 percentage points. A YouGov poll from the same period showed Starmer with a 31% positive rating, his highest since September 2024. In April 2025, Starmer and Ishiba held a telephone call to discuss the economic impact of U.S. tariffs and agreed to cooperate on global issues.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on the most recent late-May data, Ishiba is ahead with 32% approval vs Starmer's 28%, suggesting a No outcome if this persists",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ishiba maintains his current polling advantage over Starmer or extends it, driven by continued domestic political challenges for Starmer in the UK or positive developments for Ishiba in Japan. Alternatively, both leaders' ratings could decline but Ishiba remains ahead, or they could tie.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starmer's approval recovers to levels seen in early May when he was at 36% while Ishiba's declining or stagnating, driven by positive policy developments in the UK or domestic challenges for Ishiba in Japan. The volatility we've observed suggests this is plausible.",
    "rationale": "The data shows remarkable volatility: in less than a month, we've seen an 11-point swing from Starmer leading by 7 points (36% vs 29% in early May) to Ishiba leading by 4 points (32% vs 28% in late May). This high volatility makes forecasting difficult. While status quo bias normally suggests weighting the current situation heavily, the extreme recent fluctuations suggest these approval ratings are highly unstable for both leaders. The most recent data point favors a No outcome (Ishiba ahead), but we're forecasting 32 days out - roughly the same timeframe that produced the previous large swing. Both leaders face domestic challenges: Starmer's ratings have been low since taking office, while Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party faced electoral setbacks. The question resolves on July 1, giving time for either leader to experience approval shifts from policy announcements, economic developments, or political events. I'm not forecasting higher because the most recent data shows Ishiba ahead, and status quo outcomes deserve weight even with volatility. I'm not forecasting lower because the recent data shows these ratings can swing dramatically in short periods, and Starmer was ahead just weeks ago. To update upward, I'd need to see new polling showing Starmer closing the gap or positive momentum for him. To update downward, I'd need sustained polling showing Ishiba extending his lead.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nPolling data from early 2025 shows fluctuating approval ratings for both leaders.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
