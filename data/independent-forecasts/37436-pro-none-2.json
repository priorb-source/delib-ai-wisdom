    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months. The final OCHA snapshot will be published before July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. With 295 reported fatalities as of April 30, 2025, a continuation of the conflict at its recent pace would likely result in at least 5 additional UN staff deaths over the next two months, surpassing the 300 threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A comprehensive and lasting ceasefire is implemented in May 2025 and holds through June. The cessation of major hostilities prevents further UN staff casualties, and the final reported number remains below 300.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The conflict continues through May and June 2025, with either sustained fighting or sporadic major escalations. In this environment, at least five more UN staff are killed in various incidents or a single catastrophic event, pushing the reported total to 300 or more.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is driven by the very small gap between the current reported number of fatalities (295) and the resolution threshold (300). Only five additional UN staff deaths need to be reported over the remaining two-month period (May and June 2025) to trigger a 'Yes' outcome. The conflict zone remains exceptionally perilous for aid workers. The historical average since October 2023 has been over 15 UN staff fatalities per month. Even assuming a significant de-escalation from the peak intensity, a rate of just 2.5 fatalities per month would be sufficient to cross the threshold. This seems highly plausible as long as active hostilities persist. Furthermore, the risk of a single mass-casualty event, such as a strike on a UN facility or convoy, remains significant and could resolve this question in an instant. The primary factor that would lead to a 'No' outcome is a durable, long-term ceasefire, which has so far been unattainable. My forecast is not higher than 80% to account for the non-trivial possibility that ongoing ceasefire negotiations succeed or that there is a prolonged operational pause. It is not lower because the number of additional fatalities required is remarkably small given the two-month timeframe and the continued high-risk operational environment for UN personnel.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025. For example, a snapshot dated April 30, 2025, [reports](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-30-april-2025) 295 UN staff fatalities.\n\nIf OCHA stops posting new updates, this resolves as the most recent number, which as of the time of this question would be the impact snapshot posted on April 30, 2025.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
