  "information": "GoPro's financial results for 2024 showed a full-year revenue of $801 million, a 20% decline year-over-year, with a net loss of $432 million, or $2.82 per share. As of December 31, 2024, the company held $283 million in cash reserves against $131 million in debt. The company's current ratio was reported at 0.5, and its market capitalization was approximately $90.68 million as of May 1, 2025, with a stock price of $0.58.\n\nFor its upcoming first quarter 2025 earnings report, scheduled for May 12, 2025, analysts expect GoPro to report a quarterly loss of approximately $0.13 per share on revenues of around $124.9 million, which would represent a year-over-year revenue decline of about 19.6%. The company itself has stated it expects unit sales and revenue in 2025 to be lower than in 2024, citing macroeconomic headwinds and competition. In response, the company has initiated plans to reduce operating expenses by nearly 30% during 2025.\n\nIn early 2025, GoPro announced it was named the official camera of the 2025 Freeride World Tour for the 12th consecutive year. The company also released a minor upgrade to its GoPro Max panoramic camera in February 2025. Reports in May 2025 also noted the release of a new GoPro Hero13 camera featuring an anamorphic lens. The company's most significant debt maturity is a convertible note due in November 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "53 days (from May 9, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - GoPro does not file for bankruptcy. Most companies, even financially distressed ones, do not file for bankruptcy in any given short period, as it represents a last resort decision.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GoPro continues operations through July 1, 2025, using its $283 million in cash reserves to cover short-term obligations while implementing its planned 30% operating expense reduction. The company navigates through weak earnings and market conditions without reaching the point where bankruptcy protection becomes necessary in this two-month window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The May 12 earnings report reveals significantly worse-than-expected results, triggering accelerated cash burn, supplier payment demands, or covenant violations. Management determines that filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection before the November 2025 convertible note maturity is the best path forward to restructure debts and operations.",
    "rationale": "GoPro faces serious financial distress but likely has sufficient runway to avoid bankruptcy before July 1, 2025. The company maintains $283 million in cash against $131 million in debt (positive net cash of $152 million), which provides a buffer even given the massive $432 million net loss in 2024. The critical concern is the current ratio of 0.5, indicating current liabilities double current assets, suggesting significant near-term obligations. However, with 53 days until resolution and management actively implementing a 30% operating expense reduction, bankruptcy in this narrow window seems unlikely unless conditions deteriorate dramatically. The key debt maturity (convertible notes) occurs in November 2025, after the resolution date, reducing immediate pressure. The May 12 earnings report is a critical inflection point - poor results could accelerate a crisis, but the company would still need to exhaust alternatives before filing. Base rate considerations suggest that even distressed public companies rarely file for bankruptcy within any given 2-month period. Why not higher: positive net cash position, active cost-cutting measures, no immediate debt maturity forcing action, and bankruptcy typically exhausts other options first. Why not lower: the 0.5 current ratio signals severe liquidity stress, ongoing massive losses, declining revenues, and tiny market capitalization suggesting market anticipates potential failure. I would increase my forecast if the May 12 earnings reveal cash burn accelerating beyond expectations or if reports emerge of supplier/creditor pressure. I would decrease it if earnings show stabilization or if the company announces new financing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill GoPro file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and 2024 Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000150043525000003/gpro2024-12x31exh991xer.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nGoPro's financial results for 2024 showed a full-year revenue of $801 million, a 20% decline year-over-year, with a net loss of $432 million, or $2.82 per share.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
