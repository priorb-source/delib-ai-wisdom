    "review": "All three forecasts cluster in the 9-15% range, showing strong agreement on fundamentals. Forecaster 3 provides the most compelling new detail: specific pre-test signatures (cable-laying to portals, vehicles/equipment movement, temporary support facilities, water pumping) that historically appear days to weeks before nuclear tests. This granular breakdown strengthens the case that with 61 days remaining and zero such indicators, the probability should be lower. Their point about North Korea achieving signaling goals through missile tests without paying the higher diplomatic cost of nuclear detonation is also strategically important - we've seen this pattern in 2022-2025 with extensive missile testing but no nuclear tests despite multiple windows of opportunity. Forecaster 2's emphasis on unpredictability cuts the other way, though even they landed at only 15%. The convergence around 9-15% with similar reasoning suggests we've identified the key factors correctly.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, Forecaster 3's detailed breakdown of observable pre-test indicators is more persuasive than I initially weighted. Nuclear tests aren't easily concealed - they require infrastructure preparation that satellite imagery typically detects. The complete absence of cable-laying, equipment staging, water pumping, or personnel buildups at Punggye-ri with only 61 days remaining significantly constrains the probability space. While North Korea can surprise observers, surprise nuclear tests still leave detectable signatures in the days/weeks beforehand. The historical pattern shows these preparations surface before detonations. Additionally, the strategic substitution point is well-taken: North Korea has maintained pressure and signaled resolve through intensive missile testing in 2024-2025 without incurring the severe costs of a nuclear test. This suggests their current strategy doesn't require nuclear detonation to achieve near-term objectives. The rhetoric from Kim Jong Un, while escalatory, hasn't translated to nuclear test preparations despite similar or stronger language in previous years. I'm adjusting down from 12% to 10% based primarily on the absence of specific observable indicators that should be present by now if a test were imminent within two months.",
