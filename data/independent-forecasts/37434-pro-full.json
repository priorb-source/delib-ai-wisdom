  "information": "According to its latest financial reports, AquaBounty Technologies' cash reserves declined from $9.2 million at the end of 2023 to $230,000 as of December 31, 2024. The company reported a GAAP EPS of -$29.47 and revenue of $0.79 million for the fiscal year, a 68% year-over-year decrease. The company's former CFO stated, \"We do not have sufficient liquidity to continue operations,\" and management has issued a going-concern warning. The company's reported debt-to-equity ratio is 0.05.\n\nIn December 2024, AquaBounty announced it was ceasing fish farming activities, shutting down its last operational facility, and culling its remaining fish stock. The company laid off \"substantially all\" of its staff at the site. With production halted, there is no operating cash inflow. Management has acknowledged that its capital-raising efforts have been unsuccessful for over a year and has stated it is \"assessing alternatives\" for its Ohio facility.\n\nBy March 2025, AquaBounty's market capitalization had fallen to approximately $2.2 million, with its stock price dropping from a 52-week high of $3.05 to well below $1. The stock is trading below the NASDAQ compliance threshold, risking delisting. Despite the low price, institutional investor Epiq Partners LLC increased its holdings in the company by 423.5% in the fourth quarter. As of early 2025, institutional investors and hedge funds own 8.92% of the company's stock.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The company has ceased all revenue-generating operations, has virtually no cash, and has been unable to secure new funding. The status quo trajectory leads directly to a bankruptcy filing to manage its remaining liabilities and assets.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The company avoids bankruptcy by orchestrating a sale of its primary assets (such as its Ohio facility or intellectual property) for enough cash to remain solvent past the deadline, or it is acquired outright by another firm before a filing becomes necessary.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Unable to meet its remaining financial obligations due to a lack of cash and no incoming revenue, AquaBounty's board of directors determines that filing a petition for bankruptcy is the only viable path to an orderly liquidation or restructuring, and does so before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the company's critical financial distress. The research indicates AquaBounty's cash reserves dwindled to just $230,000 by the end of 2024, accompanied by a going-concern warning from management and a statement from the former CFO that they lack the liquidity to continue. Crucially, the company has ceased all fish farming operations, laid off substantially all staff at its main facility, and has no source of operating income. After more than a year of unsuccessful capital-raising efforts, its options are severely limited. The company is, for all practical purposes, no longer a going concern. The current state is unsustainable, making a bankruptcy filing the most logical and probable action to manage the sale of its remaining assets and address its liabilities.\n\nMy probability is not higher because there remains a small chance of a pre-bankruptcy resolution. A competitor or investment fund might see value in acquiring the company's intellectual property or real estate assets and could make an offer to purchase the company or its assets outright, avoiding the bankruptcy process. This is suggested by the minor, albeit significant, increase in holdings by Epiq Partners LLC, which may be a distressed-asset play. The company could potentially sell its Ohio facility just in time to generate enough cash to limp past the July 1 deadline.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the combination of near-zero cash, zero revenue, a cessation of core operations, and a history of failed financing attempts presents an overwhelming case for imminent insolvency. The path to survival is exceptionally narrow and relies on a last-minute salvation event, which is a low-probability outcome. For me to lower my forecast, there would need to be a credible announcement of a successful asset sale, a binding acquisition offer, or a new financing agreement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill AquaBounty Technologies file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[AquaBounty Technologies Announces Full Year 2024 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603978/000160397825000012/aqb-20250327xex99_1.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
