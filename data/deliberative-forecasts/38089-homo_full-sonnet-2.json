    "review": "Both forecasters provide well-reasoned analyses that largely align with my own reasoning but with slightly higher confidence levels (70% and 72% vs my 65%). The key new insight they emphasize is that Morning Consult updates monthly, meaning likely only 1-2 data points will emerge before July 1 resolution. Forecaster 3's specific calculation that we're 21 days from the May 8 data with 33 days remaining is particularly useful. This monthly update frequency strengthens the status quo case more than I initially weighted - with potentially just one new data point, the persistence argument becomes more compelling. Both forecasters also clearly articulate the same key risks (narrow 3-point gap, high disapproval rates, volatility) while concluding the short timeframe and recent data justify higher confidence. I find their reasoning sound but note they may be slightly underweighting the genuine narrowness of the margin - 3 percentage points at approval levels in the low 30s represents meaningful uncertainty that a single monthly update could reverse.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the monthly update frequency is a stronger argument for status quo persistence than I initially credited. With potentially only one new Morning Consult reading before July 1, the May 8 data showing Sánchez ahead 35% to 32% carries more weight. The 33-day window is indeed quite short for dramatic approval rating reversals absent major crises or scandals, and neither leader faces imminent known events likely to cause such shifts. However, I remain cautious about going as high as 72% because the 3-point gap truly is narrow - this represents less than a 10% relative difference and could easily reverse in a single monthly measurement even without dramatic events, simply through normal polling variation or modest shifts in public sentiment. Both leaders operate in volatile political environments with approval ratings in the low 30s, indicating weak public support. While Turkey's consumer confidence gains and Erdoğan's constitutional reform controversies create cross-cutting pressures, there's no clear directional signal suggesting imminent change. Balancing the strong persistence case (recent data, short timeframe, monthly updates) against the legitimate uncertainty from the narrow margin, I'm updating to 70% - acknowledging the forecasters' valid emphasis on temporal constraints while maintaining that this isn't a slam-dunk given the gap size.",
