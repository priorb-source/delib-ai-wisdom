    "review": "My initial forecast of 58% was based on the PNM's incumbency and a key poll suggesting they would benefit from a vote-split in Tobago. Forecaster 2's analysis (62%) reinforced the incumbency argument but lacked new information. Forecaster 3's analysis (52%) was highly convincing and introduced critical context I had missed. Specifically, they noted this is an early election triggered by the Prime Minister's resignation, meaning the PNM is led by a new, electorally untested leader (Stuart Young). This fundamentally weakens the standard incumbency advantage. Forecaster 3 also highlighted other negatives for the PNM: high crime as a salient issue, a high-profile endorsement for the opposition (UNC), and the UNC's consolidation with the COP. These are compelling arguments that introduce significant downside risk for the PNM, which my initial analysis did not account for.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 58% to 52%. The new information provided by Forecaster 3, particularly that this election stems from a prime ministerial resignation, significantly alters the landscape. The PNM's incumbency advantage is substantially weaker with a new leader, and they now face clear headwinds from the crime issue and a seemingly more consolidated opposition. My initial analysis heavily relied on the Guardian TT poll indicating a vote-split in Tobago's two seats would benefit the PNM. I still believe this is a crucial and credible piece of evidence in the PNM's favor and it is the primary reason my forecast remains above 50%. However, this specific advantage in two constituencies is now balanced against a much more challenging national environment for the governing party. The race now appears to be a genuine toss-up. My revised forecast of 52% reflects that the PNM's path to a plurality has narrowed, and they retain only the slightest edge based almost entirely on the specific Tobago dynamic counteracting their weakened incumbency.",
