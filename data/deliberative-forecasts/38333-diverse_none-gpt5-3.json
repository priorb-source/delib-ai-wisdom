    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the very short runway and lack of visible pre-announcement signals. Forecaster 2’s focus on operational lead time (staff, committee activity, donor coordination) credibly argues for a low probability in the near term; I find that persuasive and directionally aligned with my prior. Forecaster 3 reasonably notes that 26 days is enough to announce and that the Axios piece confirms genuine interest, but 30% feels high absent any buzz or infrastructure signs a month after that report. Neither added hard new information, but Forecaster 2’s framing of the logistical hurdles strengthens the case to shade lower than my initial estimate.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~25 days. The status quo is No, and there are no public indicators of an imminent launch (no staff hires, event holds, or committee ramp-up reported). While a late-June announcement tied to fundraising optics is plausible, credible statewide bids usually leak staffing and planning ahead of time; the silence a month after the Axios item points toward either waiting past July or not running. Suarez’s ambition keeps this above a de minimis number, but without new signals the base case remains No. I’m nudging down from 20% to 15% to reflect the operational realities highlighted by Forecaster 2, while still allowing for a surprise June move.",
