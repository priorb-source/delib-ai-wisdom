  "information": "In April 2025, the Ministry of Tourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) warned tourism stakeholders against promoting or facilitating the use of illegal taxis, with businesses facing a $1000 fine for such referrals. The government has emphasized that operating an unlicensed taxi is a serious offense, with penalties for drivers including a fine and disqualification from driving. The country, with a resident population of approximately 45,000, has also implemented a new \"Rate Your Ride\" framework. As of May 2025, two locally-based ride-hailing services are confirmed to be operating: GetMe Ride, which launched in 2019, and Conch Cab, which began service in May 2025.\n\nUber's recent expansion strategy has focused on major international markets and technological partnerships. In December 2024, the company launched an \"Uber Taxi\" service in Curitiba, Brazil, integrating licensed local taxi drivers onto its platform through a partnership with mobility company Stuo. In the U.S., Uber partnered with autonomous vehicle developer May Mobility in May 2025, with plans to deploy self-driving taxis in Arlington, Texas, by late 2025 and expand to other cities in 2026. Reports indicate that Uber's historical pattern in the Caribbean has been to prioritize larger markets over smaller island jurisdictions.\n\nTourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands grew significantly in 2024, with the islands welcoming nearly two million visitors across air and cruise travel. This total represents a 10.66% increase in air arrivals and a 30.48% increase in cruise passengers compared to the previous year. New airline routes have been added to accommodate the demand, including a nonstop American Airlines service from Miami to South Caicos launched in March 2025. Concurrently, the U.S. Department of State maintains a Level 2 \"exercise increased caution\" travel advisory for TCI, first issued in July 2023, citing crime levels and reminding travelers of the islands' strict laws against firearms and ammunition.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Uber is not currently available in Turks and Caicos, and there are no credible, public signals of an imminent launch.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The government continues its crackdown on unlicensed taxis, local ride-hailing apps (GetMe Ride, Conch Cab) meet demand for the summer season, and Uber neither announces nor lists TCI on its website by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Uber secures a rapid partnership with licensed taxi operators and/or the government, launches an “Uber Taxi” or similar product in Providenciales (and possibly other islands), and is listed as available for Turks and Caicos on Uber’s website by July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Uber is not currently available in Turks and Caicos (TCI). The Ministry of Tourism recently warned stakeholders against promoting illegal taxis and set fines, signaling a protective and enforcement-oriented stance. Two local e-hailing services (GetMe Ride since 2019; Conch Cab launched May 2025) already operate, suggesting the regulatory path favors locally licensed solutions. Uber’s recent expansion pattern prioritizes larger markets and taxi integrations in sizeable cities (e.g., Curitiba), not micro-markets like TCI (~45k residents), even though tourism is strong (~2M annual visitors). With only ~2 months to July 1, the window for regulatory engagement, partner onboarding, and a formal listing on Uber’s site is short.\nWhy not higher: • No visible regulatory invitation or partnership chatter. • Uber historically de-prioritizes very small island markets. • Government emphasis on enforcement against unlicensed taxis and the existence of local apps reduce the need for Uber’s entry before peak summer.\nWhy not lower: • Uber can sometimes move quickly via “Uber Taxi” integrations with licensed fleets. • Strong tourism creates a plausible commercial case for a limited-scope launch (e.g., airport/tourist corridors) if a local taxi association and regulators align.\nWhat would raise my forecast: • Credible reports of Uber negotiations with TCI authorities or taxi associations; • Uber job postings or ops roles specific to TCI; • Government statements welcoming ride-hailing integrations; • Uber test pages/help center entries or partner press releases naming TCI.\nWhat would lower my forecast: • Explicit government statements opposing Uber’s entry; • Exclusive arrangements between TCI and local ride-hailing providers; • Continued enforcement plus no media signals of Uber activity by mid-June.\nSummary of assistant’s info affecting my view: Government enforcement and fines against illegal taxis; small resident population; active local e-hail options; Uber’s focus on larger markets and taxi integrations elsewhere; strong but not determinative tourism demand. All of this points to the status quo persisting through July 1, with a small tail risk of a fast taxi-integration launch.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
