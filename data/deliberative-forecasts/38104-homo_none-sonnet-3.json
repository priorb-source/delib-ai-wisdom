    "review": "The other forecasters raise valid points that I should consider. All three of us converge on the key challenge: the all-or-nothing requirement combined with the historical pattern that escapees who evade initial capture become progressively harder to apprehend. Forecaster 2 and 3 both forecast 38-40%, notably higher than my 28%. Their reasoning about the 32 days remaining being 'substantial time' and the early success showing competent law enforcement response is worth weighing. However, I notice all of us are working with the same stale information - nothing after May 19. The fact that we have no news of additional captures in the 11 days since that report could cut both ways: either captures are occurring but not being reported, or the manhunt has indeed stalled after the easy targets were caught. I find their arguments partially convincing, particularly the point that we shouldn't assume zero progress since May 19, but I remain skeptical that the probability is as high as 38-40% given the stringent requirement for ALL 10 to be recaptured.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my initial forecast of 28% was slightly too pessimistic. The other forecasters correctly note that 32 days provides meaningful time for continued operations, and the early 30% capture rate (3 of 10 in 3 days) indicates an effective initial response. However, I remain more cautious than their 38-40% forecasts for several reasons: (1) The information vacuum since May 19 is concerning - if significant progress were being made, we'd likely have news of it; (2) The all-or-nothing requirement creates an asymmetric risk where even one escapee evading capture means failure; (3) Using rough probability calculations, if each of the remaining 5-7 escapees has an 80-85% individual recapture probability over 32 days, the joint probability of catching ALL ranges from 21-44%, with the lower end if 7 remain at large; (4) Historical precedent suggests that escapees who survive the initial 48-72 hour window often have resources, planning, or support that makes them significantly harder to catch. I'm updating upward to acknowledge the substantial time remaining and avoid anchoring too heavily on pessimism, but not as high as the other forecasters because I weight the all-or-nothing requirement more heavily.",
