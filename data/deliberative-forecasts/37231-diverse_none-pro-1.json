    "review": "My initial forecast was overconfident because it was based on the faulty assumption that I had access to the March 2025 unemployment data. The other two forecasters correctly operated under the given constraint that 'no additional information' was available, and rightly identified this information gap as the primary source of uncertainty. I found Forecaster 3's reasoning particularly convincing. Their arguments about Mexico's structural labor market features—specifically nearshoring creating sustained demand and a large informal sector acting as a buffer against shocks to official unemployment—are crucial insights that I had not sufficiently weighed. Forecaster 2 correctly highlighted the uncertainty stemming from the lack of data and the lagged effect of potential tariffs. Both provided a necessary corrective to my initial overconfidence.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward from 88% to 65%. The primary reason for this large revision is correcting my initial error of assuming I knew the March 2025 unemployment rate. Operating from the same information-constrained starting point as the other forecasters, my confidence is much lower.\n\nMy revised rationale is heavily influenced by Forecaster 3's structural arguments. The tailwinds from nearshoring and the shock-absorbing nature of the informal economy suggest a strong tendency for the official unemployment rate to remain low, making a sub-3.0% reading the default state. This structural bias persuades me that a 'Yes' outcome is still more probable than not, justifying a forecast above 50%.\n\nHowever, I am tempering this by incorporating the risks and uncertainties noted by both other forecasters and in my initial analysis. These include the potential (though likely lagged) impact of US tariffs on the auto sector, inherent month-to-month volatility in the data, and the strictness of the resolution criteria where a 3.0% reading resolves as 'No'. The lack of recent Q1 2025 data means we cannot be certain about the recent trend and starting point for April, which introduces significant uncertainty. Therefore, while I believe the structural factors favor a 'Yes', the lack of confirming data prevents a high-confidence forecast. My new probability of 65% reflects a belief that 'Yes' is the most likely outcome, while acknowledging a substantial (35%) chance of 'No' due to these uncertainties.",
