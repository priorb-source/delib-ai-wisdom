    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement by the ITKF naming Egypt as the 2026 World Championship host before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ITKF defers the 2026 host decision to a later congress in mid/late 2025, or selects a different host, or simply makes no public announcement by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following recent discussions with Egyptian officials, the ITKF Executive Board approves Egypt’s bid and issues a public announcement (website, press release, or official social channels) before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates and timing: International federations, especially smaller ones, often finalize and announce hosts at congresses or aligned with major events. With only ~7–8 weeks left, absent prior public signals, the base chance of a new host announcement in this narrow window is modest.\n- Status quo weight: As of May 8, 2025, there is no ITKF announcement; the default trajectory is no announcement by July 1. I overweight this because institutional processes change slowly.\n- Evidence available: The cited Vetogate report indicates Egypt’s sports minister discussed hosting 2026 with the ITKF president. This shows interest and some momentum but stops short of indicating a concluded decision. My research assistant found no additional confirmations or scheduling of an imminent ITKF decision meeting, which limits the near-term likelihood.\n- Why not higher: Short lead time to the deadline; host selections typically need formal board approval and are often timed to scheduled meetings. Lack of corroborating reports from ITKF channels or international media reduces near-term odds.\n- Why not lower: Egypt’s government support and experience hosting international events could accelerate approval. Smaller federations sometimes move quickly and announce hosts on relatively short notice, so a sudden official communiqué is plausible.\n- What would move me up: ITKF publishing an agenda or minutes indicating a late-May/June board meeting; credible reports of executive approval; statements from the Egyptian Karate Federation or the ITKF president foreshadowing an imminent announcement; official ITKF teasers about 2026 host.\n- What would move me down: News of competing bids being considered later in 2025; scheduling of the host decision at a post-July congress; signs of organizational or funding delays; regional instability affecting event planning.\n- Summary of assistant’s info: No additional information beyond the Vetogate report, implying no public ITKF confirmation yet.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the International Traditional Karate Federation announce that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship?\n\nQuestion background:\nVetoGate Egypt: [Ashraf Sobhi discusses hosting the 2026 World Cup with the President of the International Traditional Karate Federation](https://www.vetogate.com/5400045)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the International Traditional Karate Federation announces that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
