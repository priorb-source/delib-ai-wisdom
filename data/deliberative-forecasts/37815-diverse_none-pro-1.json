    "review": "My initial analysis was flawed as it only identified one relevant report in the last year. Both other forecasters correctly identified the December 2024 Brazil report mentioned in the prompt, which I overlooked. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly compelling. They correctly calculated a base rate of 1-2 reports per year based on recent data, leading to a monthly probability of 8-16%. Crucially, they also introduced a factor I hadn't considered: the potential for posting lag at NUFORC, which could cause a late-June report to not be visible by the July 1 resolution date. This adds a slight downward pressure to the final probability. Forecaster 2's analysis correctly highlights the precedent but their final forecast of 35% seems unjustifiably high and appears to be based on an assumed frequency of reports that isn't supported by the available data.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast based on the deliberation. My initial forecast of 8% was based on finding only one pilot report from South America on NUFORC in the last 12 months. The other forecasters correctly utilized the information in the prompt about a second report in December 2024. With two known reports (June 2024 and December 2024) in the last year, the base rate is more accurately reflected as two events per year. This doubles the raw monthly probability from my initial calculation of ~8.3% (1/12) to ~16.7% (2/12). However, I find Forecaster 3's argument about posting lag to be a crucial nuance tied to the specific resolution criteria. A report occurring late in June 2025 might not be processed and posted by NUFORC by the time the question is checked on July 1st. This introduces a small but real risk that a qualifying event could occur but not be counted for resolution. Therefore, I am adjusting the 16.7% base rate slightly downwards to account for this lag risk. This leads me to nearly double my forecast, moving from 8% to 15%.",
