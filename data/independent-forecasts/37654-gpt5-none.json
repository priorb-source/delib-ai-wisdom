    "rationale": "- Baseline and timing: With ~46 days left, large federal reorganizations—especially breaking up a major science and services agency like NOAA—are rarely completed quickly. Even with an aligned administration and Congress, statutory, budgetary, and operational hurdles make a full breakup by July 1 highly unlikely.\n- Structural constraints: Distributing NOAA’s components across departments typically requires legislation or complex interagency actions. Historical base rates for major executive branch reorganizations completing within months are extremely low.\n- Tracker behavior: Community trackers tend to reserve Complete for clearly accomplished items. The prompt says the item was In Progress; absent clear, completed action, the status quo is that it remains not complete by July 1.\n- Why not higher: Limited time window; high legal/administrative barriers; lack of public evidence (research assistant had no additional info) of imminent, decisive steps.\n- Why not lower: A small chance exists that moderators could count a sweeping executive directive or a concrete, implemented reorg as sufficient for “Complete,” or that rapid legislative action occurs unexpectedly. There’s also slight subjectivity risk in how the tracker defines completion.\n- What would move me up: Passage of legislation or signed orders with immediate, implemented reorganization splitting NOAA’s components; credible reporting that the tracker will mark the objective complete upon issuance of such an order; or the spreadsheet itself flipping to Complete before July 1.\n- What would move me down: Statements from the tracker that only enacted and implemented statutory reorganization counts; indications the objective is paused/blocked; or the entry remaining unchanged deep into June.\n- Research assistant input: None beyond confirming no additional information; thus I lean on base rates, institutional constraints, and the short timeline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
