    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33-37 days. Glastonbury 2025 is scheduled for June 25-29, 2025, and today is May 23, 2025. The outcome could be known earlier if Kneecap is removed from the lineup before the festival begins.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - Kneecap is currently officially listed on the Glastonbury 2025 lineup and scheduled to perform. If nothing changes from the current situation, they will perform.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury organizers remove Kneecap from the lineup due to mounting political pressure following the controversies. Alternatively, UK authorities could deny entry to band members based on the Metropolitan Police investigations into alleged support for banned terrorist organizations (Hamas and Hezbollah), or legal action could prevent their performance. The band could also voluntarily withdraw.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kneecap performs as scheduled. Glastonbury organizers, known for supporting artistic freedom and progressive causes, resist political pressure to remove the band. No legal barriers materialize from the police investigations in time to prevent the performance. The band takes the stage during the June 25-29 festival window.",
    "rationale": "The critical factor here is that Kneecap is ALREADY officially on the Glastonbury lineup with only 33 days until the festival. Status quo bias should weigh heavily - once acts are announced this close to a major festival, lineup changes are relatively rare absent extraordinary circumstances. Glastonbury has historically championed artistic freedom and featured politically controversial acts, making them less likely to cave to external pressure. While the allegations are serious (alleged support for banned organizations, inflammatory statements about MPs), mere calls for removal and ongoing police investigations don't necessarily translate to actual barriers. The band has apologized for the 'dead Tory' comments, showing some willingness to manage controversy. However, several real risks exist: (1) the Metropolitan Police investigations could escalate to charges or entry bans before June 25, (2) political pressure could intensify if the controversy gains more media attention, (3) the UK government could intervene with visa/entry denials given the sensitivity around proscribed organizations. That said, no concrete action has been announced yet, and we're very close to the performance date. The probability isn't higher (say 90%+) because the legal and political risks are genuine and unprecedented - supporting proscribed terror groups is a serious criminal matter in the UK. It's not lower (say 60%) because the status quo strongly favors performance, time is running short for interventions, and Glastonbury's institutional culture supports controversial artists. A forecast update would require: news of actual removal from lineup (sharply lower), legal charges filed (lower), or clear statements from organizers defending their inclusion (higher).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
