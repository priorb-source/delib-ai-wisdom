    "review": "Forecaster 2 rightly emphasizes the strength of the Politico signal and the momentum an explicit blueprint can create, but I think they over-weight that single datapoint given no follow-on indicators (staff hires, event leaks, filings) and no hard strategic deadline before July 1 for a 2026 race, especially for a wealthy self-funder. Forecaster 3’s reliance on status quo persistence and the significance of three weeks of silence post-article matches my priors and better reflects base rates for “trial balloons” that do not translate into immediate announcements. Net, F2 adds some weight to the near-term launch possibility, but F3’s caution is more persuasive.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~24 days. The status quo (no announcement) tends to persist absent a forcing function. For a 2026 governor’s race, there’s little necessity to announce before July 1; a self-funder like Morgan can ramp quickly later, reducing any Q2 fundraising optics incentive. Morgan’s history of high-profile flirtations without running also pushes against a near-term announcement. The Politico blueprint is a meaningful positive signal, but the lack of subsequent concrete steps (reported staff hires, venue bookings, a date leak) three weeks later weakens the case for imminence. A Yes scenario would be Morgan deciding to quickly freeze the Democratic field or capitalize on current attention; a No scenario is continued testing-the-waters with a fall 2025 timeline. I’m nudging up slightly from 27% to 30% to reflect Forecaster 2’s point about the blueprint creating real momentum, but I remain below 50% due to timing, incentives, and base rates.",
