    "review": "Both forecasters compellingly emphasize bureaucratic inertia and the very short timeline, which indeed favors a Yes. However, neither explicitly addresses the resolution’s dependence on wording on the specific BC Hydro page. Even if Tesla remains excluded in policy, a communications refresh that removes the explicit brand call-out (e.g., switching to generic “U.S.-produced goods are ineligible” language or moving details to a separate FAQ) would resolve No. That omission makes 95% feel overconfident. Forecaster 3’s 88% is closer to my view; it reflects policy stickiness while leaving room for the page-wording risk.",
    "rationale": "- Time to resolution: ~1 month. The March 12, 2025 policy is recent and government-backed, so reversal by July is unlikely.\n- Status quo: The BC Hydro page explicitly notes Tesla products are ineligible. If unchanged, the question resolves Yes.\n- Key risk: The resolution depends on the exact page explicitly stating Tesla is not eligible. A website update that drops the Tesla mention (even while maintaining practical exclusion) would resolve No. This risk is non-trivial given normal web content maintenance, though a change within a month is still unlikely.\n- External pressures: Trade/diplomatic/legal challenges typically take longer than a month to translate into a public-facing reversal, so a policy U-turn by July is low probability.\n- Net: Strong odds the exclusion and explicit wording remain through July 1, but I discount for the specific-page-wording risk and small tail risk of rapid political change. I slightly raise my prior given the strong inertia argument and short window, but stay below 90 due to wording sensitivity.",
