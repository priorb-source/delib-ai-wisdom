    "review": "My initial forecast of 85% was based on the low number of additional fatalities needed (5) versus the remaining time, balanced against the possibility of a ceasefire or a halt in reporting. Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 make compelling arguments for a higher probability, and I find their reasoning convincing. Forecaster 2 correctly highlights that the threshold is so low that even a significant de-escalation, short of a complete and durable ceasefire, would likely be insufficient to prevent a 'Yes' outcome. This is a crucial point that makes the path to 'No' narrower than I had initially assessed. Forecaster 3 introduced a critical piece of new information: intelligence suggesting an impending intensification of military operations. This directly counters the primary scenario for a 'No' vote (a ceasefire) and instead suggests the risk to UN staff is likely to increase. Both forecasters rightly reserve some uncertainty for a sudden diplomatic breakthrough, but their analyses have persuaded me that my initial 15% uncertainty was too high.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am increasing my forecast. My initial 85% probability now appears overly cautious. The core of my updated reasoning rests on three points reinforced during this deliberation: 1) The extremely low threshold of only five more reported fatalities. 2) The ample timeframe of nearly two months until the resolution date. 3) The new intelligence, cited by Forecaster 3, that military operations are set to intensify. This new information significantly weakens the main argument for a 'No' outcome, which would be a de-escalation or ceasefire. As Forecaster 2 argued, even a partial de-escalation would struggle to prevent five more fatalities over two months. An intensification makes it even more likely the threshold will be crossed quickly. The combination of a minimal requirement to reach the threshold and an operational environment that is expected to become more dangerous makes the 'Yes' outcome highly probable. I am updating my forecast from 85% to 94%, reflecting a much higher degree of confidence while still leaving a small probability for a sudden, unexpected diplomatic resolution or a complete suspension of UN operations.",
