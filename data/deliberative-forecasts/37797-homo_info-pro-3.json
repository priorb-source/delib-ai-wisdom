    "review": "The deliberation revealed a strong consensus on the core drivers of this question: the high institutional inertia of the FATF and the extreme unlikelihood of any of the three current jurisdictions (North Korea, Iran, Myanmar) being removed from the 'black list' in the short term. All three forecasts agree that the only plausible path to a 'Yes' resolution is the addition of a new jurisdiction. The key divergence lies in the perceived probability of such an addition. Forecaster 2 (3%) aligns closely with my initial low-probability assessment, emphasizing the rarity of changes. Forecaster 3 (15%) presents a significantly higher risk, bringing up two points I hadn't fully weighed: 1) the 2022 addition of Myanmar demonstrates the tool is still in active use, and 2) a specific past warning to a grey-listed country (Nigeria) of 'next steps' creates a concrete, if low-probability, scenario for escalation. While I find Forecaster 3's overall probability of 15% to be too high given the historical rarity of black-list additions, their argument about the specific risk of a grey-list escalation is a valid point that my initial analysis had not explicitly modeled.",
    "rationale": "I am slightly increasing my forecast. My initial analysis at 5% was based on the strong historical inertia of the FATF black list, where changes are rare, high-stakes events. My reasoning, and that of Forecaster 2, remains sound in that the default outcome for any given plenary is 'no change'. Removals are exceptionally improbable in this timeframe. However, Forecaster 3's analysis has convinced me to modestly increase the probability of an addition. Their point about the FATF having issued a warning to a grey-listed country like Nigeria about potential 'next steps' introduces a specific risk pathway I had undervalued. While escalation from grey to black is extremely rare, and such countries are typically 'engaged' in a process to avoid this outcome, the existence of such a warning creates a tangible, non-zero failure mode. I believe Forecaster 3's 15% overstates this risk, as it would imply a surprisingly high annual probability of change. However, their point is valid enough to conclude my initial 5% was slightly too low. I am updating my forecast from 5% to 7% to better account for the small but specific risk that a grey-listed country's failure to meet its commitments could trigger this severe, but not impossible, punitive action.",
