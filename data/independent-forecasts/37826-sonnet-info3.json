  "information": "In the aftermath of the military engagements, India initiated a diplomatic offensive. The government dispatched seven all-party delegations to 32 countries for a diplomatic push scheduled between May 21 and June 5. These delegations were provided with 'talking points' and a 150-page dossier detailing India's position on cross-border terrorism. Politically, the Indian Prime Minister announced a new doctrine of 'no tolerance for terror that hides under nuclear blackmail'. In parallel, the Indian Army Chief, General Upendra Dwivedi, granted 'full authority' to the Western Commanders to retaliate with kinetic actions in response to any future violations of the ceasefire agreement by Pakistan.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days - 9 days until June 1, 2025, plus the 30-day window of June, plus a day for confirmation",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - India does not execute a kinetic attack in Pakistan proper during June 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "India's diplomatic offensive successfully garners international support and pressure on Pakistan. Pakistan exercises restraint and avoids ceasefire violations. The threat of retaliatory authority serves as an effective deterrent without being activated. Diplomatic channels and international mediation help de-escalate tensions through June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Pakistan commits ceasefire violations in late May or early June, either through cross-border firing or a terrorist incident attributed to Pakistan-based groups. Indian Western Commanders, using the full authority granted by the Army Chief, order retaliatory kinetic strikes against military targets in Pakistani provinces. The diplomatic push concludes by June 5, after which India feels less constrained to act militarily with international understanding of its position already established.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report reveals heightened India-Pakistan tensions with three critical factors: (1) recent military engagements have occurred, (2) India's Army Chief has explicitly granted 'full authority' to Western Commanders for kinetic retaliation to ceasefire violations, and (3) India is conducting an intensive diplomatic push through early June. The granting of retaliatory authority is significant and unprecedented in its explicitness, suggesting India is prepared to act. However, several factors favor the status quo (No outcome). First, the active diplomatic offensive from May 21 to June 5 indicates India is prioritizing building international support before any potential military action. Second, both nations possess nuclear weapons, creating strong deterrence against conventional military escalation. Third, the authorization is conditional - it requires a ceasefire violation by Pakistan to trigger, not a proactive strike. Fourth, international pressure and economic consequences would be substantial. The timing is notable: if diplomatic efforts conclude June 5 and Pakistan commits provocations afterward, Indian commanders have both authority and remaining time in June to act. Why not higher (above 25%): The nuclear dimension cannot be overstated - both nations understand escalation risks. The diplomatic push suggests India wants to exhaust non-military options. Pakistan, aware of India's readiness, may exercise maximum restraint. Most historical ceasefire violations don't escalate to full kinetic operations. Why not lower (below 15%): The explicit grant of authority is real and recent. The 'no tolerance' doctrine suggests a policy shift. Recent conflict indicates tensions are genuinely elevated, not theoretical. The question window is a full 30 days, providing multiple opportunities for triggering incidents. For updates: Higher if Pakistan commits clear violations, diplomatic push concludes with strong international backing for India, or explicit military threats are issued. Lower if successful mediation emerges, Pakistan shows unusual restraint, or major powers pressure India against action. Base rate consideration: Major kinetic operations between nuclear powers are rare, supporting status quo bias. However, the specific authorization and recent conflict history make this situation elevated above baseline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack in Pakistan proper in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 India–Pakistan conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_conflict)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack on targets in one of the following provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nTo count, an attack must be [kinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_military_action), using explosive weaponry or physical violence. Non-kinetic actions such as a cyberattack would not count, even one resulting in deaths.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn the aftermath of the military engagements, India initiated a diplomatic offensive.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
