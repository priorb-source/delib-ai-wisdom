    "review": "The other two forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus. We all identify the same overwhelming barriers to Han's candidacy: the missed People Power Party (PPP) primary deadline, explicit denial from party leadership, extremely poor polling numbers, strong historical norms against a caretaker running, and a complete lack of campaign infrastructure with a hard resignation deadline looming. We also agree on the primary counterargument: a non-trivial faction within the PPP is actively pressuring him to run, creating a small possibility of a last-minute, elite-driven decision. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly insightful, introducing two points I had not explicitly weighed. First, the 2017 precedent of Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn declining to run under similar circumstances provides a powerful historical anchor supporting a 'No' outcome. Second, the nuance that the resolution only requires an 'announcement'—not a formal nomination—slightly lowers the threshold for a 'Yes', justifying keeping the probability from being near zero.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 10%. My initial reasoning remains sound, and the other forecasters' analyses have reinforced, rather than altered, my view. The structural, political, and normative barriers against Han announcing a run are formidable. Forecaster 3's introduction of the 2017 Hwang Kyo-ahn precedent strengthens the case for 'No,' as it demonstrates that the institutional and political pressures to remain neutral are historically potent. However, this is balanced by the valid point they also raised: the resolution hinges merely on an announcement. This allows for a scenario where intense internal party pressure forces Han into a symbolic, last-minute announcement, even if the practical path to getting on the ballot is unclear. This slight push-and-pull from the new insights leaves my overall assessment unchanged. My 10% estimate, and the others' 12%, correctly captures the dynamic of a highly improbable but not impossible event, driven almost exclusively by internal party politics against all other indicators. There is no new evidence to justify a significant move up or down from this low-probability assessment.",
