    "review": "Both forecasters strengthened the core case by quantifying how extreme a collapse another bottom team would need to undercut Colorado’s cumulative win% by mid-June. Forecaster 2’s threshold math (e.g., Rockies 8–17 → .225; a ~.286 team would need ~2–23 or worse to drop below that) is compelling and well-calibrated. Forecaster 3’s logic is similar; there’s a minor arithmetic typo (\"14–70\" instead of 14–56) but it doesn’t affect the conclusion. I also agree with their emphasis on the short horizon and the large existing gap, which normal variance is unlikely to erase. The mention of tie/timing considerations is appropriate; ties likely still count as “lowest,” and \"on or after\" slightly favors persistence of a Yes. Overall, their arguments push me modestly higher than my initial estimate.",
    "rationale": "The gap (~.174 vs ~.286) is massive this late into the early season, and there are only ~23–26 games until June 15. Using Forecaster 2’s framing: even if Colorado goes 8–17 (ending around .225), a competitor starting near .286 would need an extreme, historically bad month (≈2–23 or worse) to finish below them; other laggards starting higher would need even worse stretches. The Rockies’ peripherals (run prevention and offense) and tough schedule argue against a big hot streak, while the \"on or after\" resolution and likely inclusion of ties both reduce downside risk for a Yes. Residual uncertainty comes from baseball’s short-run volatility (a surprise Rockies heater plus a simultaneous competitor freefall), and small snapshot/timing quirks. Balancing these, I’m moving up from 85% to 92%.",
