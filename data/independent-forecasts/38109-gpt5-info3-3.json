  "information": "June is part of the MLB regular season, during which games are scheduled on nearly every calendar day. The MLB All-Star Game is scheduled for July 2025. Other baseball-related events in late June include the Liga Mexicana de Béisbol (LMB) All-Star Game, set to take place from June 27 to 29, 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month (determinable on July 1, 2025, after June concludes)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Kalshi has been listing daily MLB game markets during the regular season, and MLB games occur essentially every day in June.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Any single calendar day in June 2025 with MLB games where Kalshi fails to post at least one real-money market tied to a specific game (e.g., a missed listing due to ops/tech issues, a temporary sports pause, or an unexpectedly blank day).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi continues its current practice of posting MLB game markets and ensures at least one game market is live each calendar day with MLB games throughout June 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/context: June is in the heart of MLB’s regular season, with games effectively every day. That means the bar is to have at least one MLB game market posted each day of the month; a single miss yields a No. The research assistant confirms June’s steady MLB schedule.\n- Status quo: Kalshi has a sports/baseball section and, in recent seasons, has routinely listed daily game markets. Sports listings can be automated and scheduled, making daily coverage plausible. The ongoing court case noted in the background pertains to political markets; it should not directly restrict sports listings, and an adverse ruling would more likely shift focus toward sports rather than away from them.\n- Why not higher: The “every day” conjunction is strict. Even with high per-day reliability, small odds of a one-day miss compound over 30 days (a site outage, deployment hiccup, or a one-off decision to skip a light MLB slate could break the streak). Uncertainty also remains about whether all game-day listings are fully automated versus partially manual.\n- Why not lower: MLB plays virtually every day in June; Kalshi already offers MLB markets; incentives favor consistent daily offerings; and any one market per day suffices (they need not cover all games). There’s no known regulatory action imminently targeting sports event contracts.\n- What would move me up: Evidence in early June of continuous daily MLB game listings; a Kalshi announcement committing to daily MLB coverage; confirmation of automated posting for the full month; absence of notable maintenance windows.\n- What would move me down: Any gap in the first week of June; indications of scheduled downtime; changes in policy that reduce daily sports listings; or unexpected legal developments affecting sports contracts.\n",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, every day in June 2025, [Kalshi](https://kalshi.com/?category=sports&tag=baseball) offers a real-money prediction market on at least one Major League Baseball game being played that day.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nJune is part of the MLB regular season, during which games are scheduled on nearly every calendar day.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
