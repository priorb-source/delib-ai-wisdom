    "review": "Key new point from Forecaster 3 is the debt limit binding since Jan 2, 2025, with Treasury using extraordinary measures and X‑date likely after our resolution date. That directly affects the reported Total Public Debt Outstanding (TPDO), which typically flatlines at the ceiling until resolution. This is the most persuasive argument because the question resolves on the reported TPDO, not on underlying deficits or maturities. Forecaster 2’s analysis appears to assume normal growth (and cites ~36.2T in early June), which is inconsistent with a binding ceiling; absent a suspension/raise, the total cannot rise freely. Their 75% seems to conflate structural deficit trends with the reporting constraint. The historical post‑resolution catch‑up (2023: ~+$360B Day 1, ~+$600B Week 1) makes it very unlikely TPDO could jump ~+$2T to surpass $37T by June 27 even if Congress acts imminently. I therefore find Forecaster 3’s reasoning substantially more convincing and consider my prior 20% too high.",
    "rationale": "Updated view: The binding debt ceiling is the dominant factor. If the ceiling remains in force through June 27 (as BPC’s X‑date window of mid‑July to early October implies), TPDO should remain pinned near the cap (roughly the reinstatement level from Jan 2025), well below $37T. A Yes outcome would require both (1) a timely suspension/raise well before June 27 and (2) an unprecedentedly large, rapid catch‑up that lifts reported TPDO by roughly $1.5–$2T within days—far exceeding historical patterns. Even aggressive TGA rebuilds and intragovernmental replenishment have produced jumps on the order of hundreds of billions in the first week, not trillions. Mid‑June receipts also tend to reduce net borrowing in the short run. Given these constraints, the base case is No. I’m lowering my forecast from 20% to 5% to reflect a small residual chance of very early legislative action plus unusually large, rapid issuance/cash rebuild, or the possibility that current TPDO is materially higher than assumed. But the weight of evidence favors No.",
