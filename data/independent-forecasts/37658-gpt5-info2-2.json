  "information": "The merger proposal has encountered significant political and union opposition. The opposition is bipartisan in nature. Former President Donald Trump has also voiced his disapproval, stating he would not support the deal and that Nippon Steel would not be able to acquire a majority stake in U.S. Steel. He attributed U.S. Steel's strong position to tariffs he had implemented. Following these remarks on February 13, 2025, U.S. Steel's stock price declined by 1.9%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the merger remains pending under review with no 8-K termination filed by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "CFIUS/antitrust reviews continue or stall; parties keep negotiating potential mitigation with the U.S. government and unions; any outside date is extended or has not yet arrived; no presidential prohibition is issued and neither party files an 8-K to terminate before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration (via CFIUS) signals or issues a formal prohibition, or makes clear it will not approve; faced with political impossibility or an imminent block, U.S. Steel and/or Nippon Steel announce abandonment/termination and file an 8-K before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: With only ~6 weeks left, many cross-border deals under CFIUS review tend to drag rather than resolve abruptly. That short window favors the status quo (no termination by the date).  \n- Political headwinds: The deal faces bipartisan and union opposition. Your assistant notes Donald Trump (now President) publicly opposed the deal on Feb 13, 2025, saying he would not support it and that Nippon Steel would not be able to acquire a majority stake. This materially raises the risk of a block and hence a pre–July 1 termination.  \n- Base rates and process: CFIUS rarely issues outright prohibitions for acquirers from close allies like Japan; more commonly there is mitigation or prolonged review. Even when a block is likely, parties often wait for formal process signals before abandoning. That inertia, plus the short time remaining, makes a pre–July 1 8-K termination less likely than not.  \n- Market signal: The 1.9% drop in U.S. Steel’s stock on Trump’s Feb 13 remarks suggests increased risk but not a market view of imminent collapse. If markets expected near-term termination, one would expect a larger dislocation relative to the merger spread.  \nWhy not higher: The main brake on a higher probability is timing and process friction—CFIUS proceedings and presidential decisions can take longer than six weeks, and parties often prefer to keep options open rather than terminate quickly. Japan’s ally status also makes an outright, rapid prohibition less typical.  \nWhy not lower: Explicit presidential opposition and organized labor resistance increase the odds of an administrative block or a politically driven abandonment. The probability that the administration moves before July 1 is nontrivial.  \nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting that CFIUS has recommended a block to the President; a White House statement signaling a forthcoming prohibition; either party guiding that the outside date is near and won’t be extended; board or union developments suggesting the target is preparing to walk.  \nWhat would move me down: Reports of a draft mitigation agreement with CFIUS; constructive public signals from the administration; union leadership softening or endorsing a path to approval; confirmation that the merger agreement’s outside date is well after July 1 and will be extended if needed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Steel/Nippon Steel merger collapse before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_U.S._Steel_by_Nippon_Steel)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, either U.S. Steel or Nippon Steel files an SEC Form 8-K announcing the merger agreement's termination or abandonment.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe merger proposal has encountered significant political and union opposition. The opposition is bipartisan in nature. Former President Donald Trump has also voiced his disapproval, stating he would not support the deal and that Nippon Steel would not be able to acquire a majority stake in U.S. Steel.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
