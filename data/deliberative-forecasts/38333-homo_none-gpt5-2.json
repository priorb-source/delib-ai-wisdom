    "review": "Both forecasters largely echo the same core points I had: short timeline, lack of pre-launch signals, and some strategic appeal to a June announcement. I agree with their emphasis on the status quo and the typical pre-announcement “smoke” (staffing, venue, filings) that’s currently absent. I’m more skeptical than Forecaster 3 about the end-of-Q2 fundraising pull in Florida, since state-level fundraising can be routed through political committees with monthly reporting, reducing the urgency to declare by June 30. Forecaster 2’s 24% feels closer to my prior; Forecaster 3’s 32% seems to overweight the June window and Q2 optics without corroborating signals. No genuinely new evidence was introduced beyond reasoning about timing norms.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~26 days to July 1. With no concrete indications of an imminent launch, the base case is No. \n- Signals: Only the early May Axios item that he’s weighing a bid; no follow-on reporting of staff hires, scheduled events, or paperwork paired with a public statement—things that typically surface weeks ahead of a launch. \n- Incentives: June is within the plausible 12–16 month pre-primary window for 2026 statewide races, and an open seat provides some incentive to move. However, Florida’s fundraising structure (political committees, monthly reporting) weakens any hard “end-of-Q2” announcement incentive. Suarez’s 2023 presidential experience and possible desire to test donor support could further slow a formal declaration. \n- Net: A non-trivial chance remains that he moves quickly in June, but the absence of telltale pre-launch indicators plus limited calendar time keeps the probability meaningfully below 25%.",
