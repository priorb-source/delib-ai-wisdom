    "review": "Both forecasters reinforced low base rates and added a couple of useful nuances I underweighted: (1) Berkshire passed on Alphabet/Meta when they were cheaper in 2022–2023, which lowers the odds they’d initiate now at higher valuations; (2) the absence of any signal or leak around the annual meeting is a mild negative; (3) the TSMC buy-and-quick-exit is a relevant datapoint for caution on AI hardware leaders like Nvidia; and (4) for highly liquid mega-caps, confidentiality is less necessary, so the lack of prior disclosure slightly tilts toward non-ownership. I agree with their takes on MSFT optics, Tesla skepticism, and the current net-seller/cash-build posture. Overall, their arguments nudge me slightly lower from my prior.\n",
    "rationale": "My prior (14%) balanced: low base rate and Berkshire’s recent risk-off stance vs. the possibility of a Ted/Todd-sized initiation in Alphabet/Meta and the large cash pile as a diversification motive. The added points that Berkshire didn’t act when Alphabet/Meta were cheaper and the lack of any hint at the annual meeting both modestly reduce the near-term odds. The confidentiality wrinkle further suppresses the chance of a Yes under the strict “reported on the 13F” criterion even if a position is being built. Names likely to appear remain Alphabet/Meta if any; MSFT/NVDA/TSLA remain unlikely for the reasons discussed. With roughly a week to go and no new signals, I trim my forecast slightly to align more with the base-rate view.\n",
