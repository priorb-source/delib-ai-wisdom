    "review": "Both forecasters provide strong, well-reasoned analyses that largely align with my initial assessment. Forecaster 3's specific citation of Counterman v. Colorado (2023) adds helpful precision to the legal analysis. The most compelling new argument is the emphasis on the complete absence of concrete prosecutorial steps - no charges, warrants, subpoenas, or grand jury activity - despite the investigation being active for weeks. This is a strong negative signal. Forecaster 3 also makes an excellent point that while the question resolves Yes for ANY arrest, Comey's profile makes incidental arrests (DUI, protest, etc.) highly unlikely given his status and age. The observation that Comey was interviewed and NOT arrested at that time is particularly telling - if probable cause existed, authorities could have acted then. However, I find Forecaster 2's point about non-zero political tail risk compelling, given the current administration's track record of unusual actions. The gap between my 4% and Forecaster 3's 2% represents a reasonable disagreement about how to weight political pressure versus institutional/legal constraints.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating slightly downward. The key factor pushing me lower is the complete absence of any concrete prosecutorial movement despite weeks of investigation. If an arrest were to occur within 32 days, we would typically expect to see some signals by now - grand jury activity, subpoenas, sealed filings, or credible reporting of charging decisions. The fact that Comey was interviewed and released without arrest is particularly significant. The legal hurdles remain formidable: First Amendment protections, the Counterman v. Colorado requirement to prove subjective intent, and the ambiguous nature of the post that Comey has explicitly disclaimed as threatening. The base rate for arresting former FBI directors remains near zero historically. However, I'm not moving all the way to 2% because: (1) the investigation is confirmed and ongoing, (2) the political environment creates genuine tail risk of aggressive action, and (3) 32 days, while short, is not impossible for a fast-tracked case if political will exists. The InfoWars 'imminent indictment' claims remain unreliable but suggest some chatter exists. A 3% forecast reflects high confidence in no arrest while acknowledging meaningful tail risk from political factors.",
