    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6-7 weeks. The May 2025 data will be collected through the end of May and typically released by FRED in late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - The number stays below 550 thousand. With February 2025 at 500k, maintaining modest growth or stabilization would keep May 2025 in the 500-520k range.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The inventory of new single-family homes grows modestly or stabilizes from February's 500k level, ending May 2025 somewhere between 505-540k. This occurs as the market finds equilibrium - builders moderate construction in response to high inventory, some demand returns as buyers adjust to conditions, and the rate of new completions hitting the market slows. Economic stability or slight improvement helps absorb some inventory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Inventory continues surging dramatically, adding 50k+ units in just three months. This happens if demand remains exceptionally weak due to economic concerns or high mortgage rates, while a large pipeline of homes under construction from previous months continues completing and hitting the market. Builders, having started projects months ago, cannot quickly adjust to market conditions and inventory accumulates rapidly.",
    "rationale": "The February 2025 baseline of 500k new homes for sale represents a historic high (excluding the 2006 bubble). To exceed 550k by May requires a 10% increase in just 3 months - approximately 16-17k additional units per month. While the multi-year trend has been strongly upward (tripling from 142k over 13 years), such rapid acceleration from an already elevated base faces natural constraints. The status quo outcome strongly favors NO because: (1) At 500k, we're already at exceptionally high levels where market forces typically trigger adjustments; (2) Month-to-month volatility exists but 10% quarterly jumps from high bases are rare; (3) Builders typically moderate activity when inventory reaches extreme levels; (4) Even in weak markets, some sales occur that prevent unlimited accumulation. However, probability isn't negligible because: (1) The momentum has been very strong; (2) There's a pipeline of homes under construction that will complete regardless of market conditions; (3) If economic conditions worsen or rates stay elevated, demand could remain extremely weak. The 3-month timeframe is relatively short for such a large absolute increase (50k units). Without evidence of extraordinary deterioration in demand or a massive completion pipeline, the base rate suggests more moderate growth. For me to forecast higher, I'd need evidence of: accelerating month-over-month increases in March/April data, significant economic deterioration, or data showing massive completion pipelines. For a lower forecast, I'd need signs of demand recovery or builder pullback.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of new single family homes for sale in the US exceed 550 thousand in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Kobeissi Letter](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1912142359577403619): \"BREAKING: The number of new single-family homes for sale has surged to 500,000 in February, the highest since November 2007.\n\nThe number of new homes on the market has more than TRIPLED over the last 13 years, from a low of 142,000.\n\nExcluding the 2006 housing bubble this is, by far, the largest supply of new homes in history.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of New One Family Homes for Sale in the United States reported for May 2025 is greater than 550 thousand, according to what is presented by [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HNFSEPUSSA).\n\nEnsure units is set to \"Thousands of Units, Seasonally Adjusted\" and frequency is set to \"Monthly, End of Month\". Question resolves based on the number presented by FRED, and no other resolution source will be considered.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
