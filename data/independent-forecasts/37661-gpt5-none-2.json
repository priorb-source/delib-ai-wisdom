    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Bangladesh is not currently shown as Available on Starlink’s map.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Regulatory and operational steps take longer than expected: after the PM’s “final approval,” the BTRC takes weeks to issue the formal license/type approvals and publish them; import/logistics, tax registration, payment processing, and reseller arrangements aren’t finalized in time. Starlink lists Bangladesh as “Coming Soon” or targets a later date, but does not flip to Available by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Formal license and type approval are issued quickly; Starlink has prep work done and moves fast. They open ordering (residential and/or business) and update the availability map to green for at least some Bangladeshi areas in June, similar to rapid activations seen in some other countries after final approval.",
    "rationale": "- Time left is short but not negligible (~6 weeks). The background suggests Bangladesh’s leadership has granted “final approval,” which is a major hurdle for Starlink’s entry. However, the availability map only shows “Available” once commercial ordering is live, which typically requires formal licensing paperwork, type approvals, taxation/logistics setup, and a payments path.\n- Status quo bias: today the map does not show Bangladesh as Available. In many countries, there is a lag of weeks to months between regulatory approval and the map flipping to Available. Six weeks is on the cusp: feasible if the regulatory machinery and Starlink’s operations are ready, but slips are common.\n- Reasons for Yes being plausible: political will appears aligned; Starlink can operate via inter-satellite links without local gateways; they have a history of rapid flips after final licensing in some markets (e.g., Indonesia’s swift launch following a publicized approval milestone). If BTRC formalizes licensing within days and Starlink has logistics lined up, they could go live in June.\n- Reasons for No being plausible: bureaucratic formalities (gazette publication, type approval of terminals), customs/import arrangements, local tax/billing setup, and potential coordination with a local partner can each introduce delays. Some countries move from approval to enterprise/limited deployments first, with the consumer map update lagging. Any requirement for a local gateway or additional conditions could push past July.\n- Why not higher: short runway, typical bureaucratic friction, and uncertainty whether the publicized “final approval” equates to immediate, fully executable licensing.\n- Why not lower: the key regulatory signal appears positive; Starlink has regional coverage already; they have shown capacity to operationalize quickly where governments are supportive.\n- Updates that would move the forecast:\n  • Up: BTRC publishes the formal license/type approval; Starlink posts Bangladesh pricing/order pages; credible reports of terminals clearing customs or a local distribution partner agreement; Starlink map shows “Coming Soon” with a June target.\n  • Down: reports of additional regulatory steps (e.g., gateway requirements), legal challenges, or official timelines indicating Q3 or later; extended silence past mid-June with no official documentation or commerce setup.\n- Research assistant provided no additional info beyond the background link; forecast leans moderately above even odds given the “final approval” but discounts for execution risk and time constraints.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Bangladesh as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Bangladeshi leader gives final approval to Musk's Starlink service](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/bangladeshi-leader-gives-final-approval-to-musks-starlink-service/3551404)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Bangladesh listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
