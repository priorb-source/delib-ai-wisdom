    "review": "Both forecasters raise compelling arguments I underweighted. Forecaster 2's historical precedent point is particularly strong - the Brazil 2017-18 and Nigeria 2019 yellow fever outbreaks, which were larger than Colombia's current situation, remained at Level 2. This is powerful evidence that CDC's framework for yellow fever specifically doesn't easily trigger Level 3 escalation. Forecaster 2 also correctly emphasizes that yellow fever's vaccine-preventability fundamentally changes CDC's risk calculus - they can advise vaccination rather than travel avoidance. Forecaster 3 makes an important distinction I glossed over: the outbreak appears confined to rural departments, not major urban tourist destinations like Bogotá or Medellín. CDC travel notices primarily assess risk to travelers, who concentrate in urban centers. All three of us agree on the short timeframe constraint, but I should have weighted it more heavily. My 18% implied roughly 1-in-5 odds of a dramatic escalation in 5-6 weeks, which seems too high given CDC's historical conservatism and the specific epidemiology of this outbreak. The 'national emergency' language that influenced my forecast is more about domestic resource mobilization than international travel risk.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I overestimated the probability by insufficiently weighing CDC's historical practice with yellow fever outbreaks. The key insight is that CDC has maintained Level 2 status even during significantly larger yellow fever outbreaks in other countries. This suggests their threshold for Level 3 on yellow fever is very high - likely requiring sustained urban transmission in major cities plus either vaccine access problems or healthcare system collapse. The current Colombian outbreak, while serious domestically (79 cases, 36 deaths), appears primarily rural and is being addressed through mass vaccination. With only 5-6 weeks remaining, the window for deterioration sufficient to trigger Level 3 is narrow. That said, I don't believe the probability should be as low as 3%. Vector-borne disease outbreaks do have inherent unpredictability, and a single introduction into an urban center with favorable conditions could spark rapid transmission. The national emergency declaration, while primarily domestic, does signal governmental concern about potential escalation. I'm updating my forecast downward significantly to 8%, aligning with Forecaster 3's assessment, which appropriately balances the strong historical precedent against the non-negligible tail risk of urban transmission emergence.",
