    "review": "All three forecasters converged on similar analyses with forecasts between 80-89%. We all identified the same baseline (105 completed as of April 16), the small gap needed (15 objectives), and the slowing completion rate. Forecasters 2 and 3 both emphasized the 44 in-progress objectives more than I initially did - this is a compelling point that strengthens the case for Yes. With 44 objectives already in progress, only 34% of these need to convert to 'Done' status to reach the 120 threshold. This provides significant buffer against slowdowns. However, I notice Forecaster 3 may have made an error calculating 46 days remaining (from today to July 1) rather than 76 days (from April 16 to July 1), though this doesn't materially affect their conclusion. The fact all forecasters independently arrived at 80-89% confidence suggests this range appropriately captures the uncertainty. The lack of data from the past 30 days (April 16 to May 16) remains a legitimate concern that prevents higher confidence.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast slightly downward to 87% for three reasons: (1) The convergence of independent forecasters at 80-89% suggests this range appropriately captures the uncertainty rather than my being at the upper bound, (2) The other forecasters' emphasis on the 44 in-progress objectives is well-taken as a strong buffer - if even one-third complete by July 1, we hit the threshold - but this was somewhat implicit in my original analysis, and (3) The 30-day data gap creates more uncertainty than I initially weighted. However, I'm not moving as low as 80% because the mathematical case remains compelling: needing only 15 objectives over 76 days with 44 already in progress means multiple pathways to success. Even at a very conservative 0.3 objectives/day (half the recent observed rate), we'd reach approximately 119 objectives - just shy but close enough that normal variance would likely push us over. The combination of small gap, substantial pipeline, and consistent historical progress justifies remaining in the 85-89% range.",
