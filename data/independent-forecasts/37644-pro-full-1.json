  "information": "In March 2025, Anthropic raised approximately $3.5 billion in a funding round that valued the company at around $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion a year prior. Key investors in this and other recent rounds include Amazon (access to $8 billion), Google (over $3 billion invested), Lightspeed Venture Partners, Salesforce Ventures, and Fidelity Management & Research Co. Analysts have noted that the company's access to deep private funding from strategic partners lowers its immediate need for capital.\n\nAnthropic has recently launched its Claude 3.7 Sonnet model and is reportedly developing new features, including a two-way voice assistant and enhanced memory functions for its AI. The company announced a five-year, $100 million partnership with Databricks to develop corporate AI agents. Concurrently, Anthropic is expanding its operations into the Asia-Pacific region, with plans to establish an office in Korea.\n\nThe typical process for an initial public offering of this size involves preparatory steps that have not been publicly observed for Anthropic. There have been no reports or leaks to major financial news outlets like Reuters, the Wall Street Journal, or Bloomberg about the company hiring investment banks or filing a confidential S-1 form. Among U.S. venture-backed companies valued at over $10 billion (decacorns), the base rate for going public is approximately one to two companies per year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1.5 months (from May 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Anthropic remains a private company and does not announce any plans for an IPO.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic's management and major investors, satisfied with the company's substantial private funding from partners like Amazon and Google, decide to forgo an IPO for the time being. They prioritize operational flexibility and long-term research over the pressures of the public market. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an S-1 filing or a formal announcement on their website.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the recent funding, Anthropic's board decides to capitalize on the strong market appetite for AI stocks and formally initiate the IPO process. Having worked on a confidential S-1 filing for months, they make a surprise announcement on their news page or publicly file the S-1 before July 1, 2025, to secure a massive capital injection and provide liquidity for early investors and employees.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo, which is that Anthropic will remain a private company through the resolution date. The primary reasons for this low probability of an IPO announcement are:\n\n1.  **Short Timeframe:** There is only about 1.5 months until the deadline. Major IPOs, even with confidential filings, typically have a longer, more visible runway involving leaks and public reports about hiring investment banks, none of which have occurred according to the provided research.\n\n2.  **Lack of Financial Need:** Anthropic is extremely well-capitalized. The reported access to billions from strategic investors like Amazon and Google significantly reduces the immediate pressure to raise capital through public markets. This ample funding allows the company to focus on its long-term strategy without the quarterly scrutiny of public investors.\n\n3.  **Absence of Preparatory Signals:** There are no public indications that Anthropic is preparing for an IPO. Financial news outlets have not reported on any of the typical preparatory steps. The base rate for a decacorn company going public is also very low, at roughly one to two per year, making an IPO for any specific company in a short timeframe an unlikely event.\n\n**Why the probability is not higher:** A higher probability would require some tangible evidence that an IPO process is underway. Given the complete lack of such signals and the strong arguments against the need for an IPO, a probability above the low single digits is not justified.\n\n**Why the probability is not lower:** The probability is not zero because a confidential filing process allows for surprise announcements. A sudden shift in market conditions or a strategic decision by the board could theoretically lead to a quick announcement within the timeframe.\n\n**How I would update:** I would significantly increase my probability upon seeing any credible reports from sources like Bloomberg, Reuters, or The Wall Street Journal about Anthropic hiring underwriters or confidentially filing an S-1. Conversely, a public statement from the CEO ruling out a 2025 IPO would cause me to lower the forecast to near zero.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn March 2025, Anthropic raised approximately $3.5 billion in a funding round that valued the company at around $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion a year prior.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
