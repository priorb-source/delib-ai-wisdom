    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identify bureaucratic inertia as the dominant factor favoring a 'Yes' outcome. The core debate is about the likelihood of a politically motivated, symbolic change overriding that inertia within the given timeframe. Forecaster 2's reasoning closely mirrored my initial thoughts. However, Forecaster 3 introduced a crucial point that I had not sufficiently weighed: the relevant timeframe for a new administration to act is not just the six weeks from today, but the full 5.5 months since their inauguration on January 20, 2025. This is a significantly longer period for a new team to identify and execute a low-level, symbolic policy signal like changing the text on a webpage. I find this reasoning highly convincing, as it makes the 'No' scenario more plausible than I had initially calculated.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 95% was predicated on the extremely short timeframe of about six weeks until resolution, assuming that was not enough time for even a motivated administration to act. Forecaster 3's analysis rightly corrected my perspective, pointing out that a new administration would have had nearly six months by July 1 to implement such a change. This extended timeframe substantially increases the probability of a politically appointed leader at the USDA identifying this specific webpage text as 'low-hanging fruit' to signal a new policy direction, as hinted at in the background article. The resolution criteria depend only on the text, not on an underlying regulatory change, which lowers the bar for action considerably. While I still believe the status quo is the most likely outcome due to the general slowness of government and competing priorities, I must revise my estimate to account for the increased opportunity for a symbolic change. I am therefore lowering my confidence in a 'Yes' outcome from 95% to 85%, increasing the implied probability of a 'No' outcome from 5% to 15%.",
