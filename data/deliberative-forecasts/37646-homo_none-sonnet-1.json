    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a crucial point I underweighted: the license is already secured, which is typically the most significant regulatory hurdle for Starlink market entry. They also correctly emphasize that a website update is operationally straightforward and 47 days is sufficient if the decision has been made. Forecaster 3's reasoning closely mirrors my own but makes an excellent clarification - the question only requires a website listing showing 'Available', not full operational service deployment, which is a notably lower bar. However, I find Forecaster 2's 60% forecast somewhat optimistic given the complete absence of information about deployment timelines, ground infrastructure, or any indication beyond the license announcement itself. The gap between license announcement and current non-availability on the website suggests organizational or operational factors that may extend beyond the July 1 deadline. All three analyses acknowledge the status quo bias and the short timeframe as meaningful constraints.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should update moderately upward. Forecaster 2's points about the license being secured and the simplicity of website updates are well-taken - I likely overweighted the operational challenges of Somalia and underweighted the significance of clearing the regulatory hurdle. The distinction that we only need a website listing (not full service) is also important and lowers the bar considerably. However, the status quo remains a strong signal: despite the license announcement, Somalia is not yet listed, suggesting there are additional steps or decisions required before listing availability. The complete lack of information about deployment progress, timeline announcements, or ground infrastructure beyond the license is concerning. While 47 days is technically sufficient for a website update, the absence of any signals about imminent deployment suggests this may not happen within our timeframe. Balancing the positive signal of the secured license against the status quo and information vacuum, I'm updating from 38% to 45% - acknowledging the valid optimistic arguments while maintaining appropriate skepticism.",
