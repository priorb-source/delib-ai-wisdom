  "information": "According to the resolution source, drought.gov, approximately 22.7 million California residents were living in areas of drought (classified as D1-D4) as of the week of May 27, 2025. The U.S. Drought Monitor map, which provides this data, is updated weekly. Earlier in the year, on March 25, 2025, the California Department of Water Resources reported that water storage at Lake Oroville was 86% full and the statewide snowpack was at 96% of the normal level for that date. Consequently, the State Water Project increased its water allocation forecast to 40% of requested supplies.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "30 days from May 29, 2025 to June 28, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the question would resolve as Yes if current conditions persist, as 22.7 million residents are currently living in drought areas, which exceeds the 20 million threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Significant rainfall in June leads to rapid improvement in drought conditions, causing the U.S. Drought Monitor to reclassify affected areas such that fewer than 20 million California residents remain in drought-designated zones",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Drought conditions persist or worsen over the next 30 days, maintaining the current status where over 22.7 million residents live in drought areas, or conditions remain relatively stable through the dry summer season",
    "rationale": "The current data shows 22.7 million California residents in drought areas as of May 27, 2025, which is 2.7 million above the 20 million threshold (a 13.5% buffer). With only 30 days until resolution and the U.S. Drought Monitor updating weekly, there will be approximately 4-5 updates before June 28. Several factors strongly favor a Yes outcome: (1) California typically experiences its dry season from late spring through summer, with June being historically one of the driest months; (2) Droughts evolve slowly and rarely resolve within a month without extraordinary precipitation; (3) The status quo bias principle suggests conditions are unlikely to change dramatically in 30 days. While the March data showing 86% full Lake Oroville and 96% snowpack indicates decent water storage, this doesn't immediately translate to drought designation changes, which depend on recent precipitation patterns and current moisture conditions. For a No outcome to occur, California would need unusual and substantial June rainfall to reduce drought-affected populations by at least 2.7 million worth of area - historically uncommon for this time of year. My forecast is not higher (95%+) because weather can be unpredictable and there's always some uncertainty in 30-day forecasts, plus the Drought Monitor classification system could shift. It's not lower because the current buffer above threshold is substantial and the seasonal timing strongly disfavors drought relief. I would update upward if June weather forecasts show persistent dry conditions, or downward if significant rainfall systems are predicted for California in June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the resolution source, drought.gov, approximately 22.7 million California residents were living in areas of drought (classified as D1-D4) as of the week of May 27, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
