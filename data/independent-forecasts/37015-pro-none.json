    "no_outcome_scenario": "The People Power Party (PPP) fails to build a consensus around drafting Han Duck-soo, or Han himself decides against running for president. Despite discussions, the logistical and political complexities of launching a presidential campaign prevent a formal announcement within the short timeframe before May 5, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The 'draft Han' movement within the PPP rapidly gains overwhelming momentum, fueled by the urgency of a snap June election. The party leadership and key factions unite behind him as the only viable candidate to ensure stability. Han accepts the draft and makes a formal public announcement of his candidacy at a press conference before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the extremely short timeline. A decision as significant as a presidential candidacy announcement typically requires extensive preparation and consensus-building that rarely concludes in under two weeks. The status quo is that Han Duck-soo is not a candidate, and in forecasting, the status quo often has strong inertia. Hence, the default assumption is that no announcement will occur.\n\nHowever, this is not a normal political environment. The question's background implies a snap election in June, a scenario that dramatically compresses political timelines and can force rapid decisions. The provided article indicates a growing 'draft' movement for Han within the ruling PPP. As Acting President, Han has high name recognition and is positioned as a stabilizing figure, making him a logical choice for an emergency candidate. This context makes an announcement more plausible than it would be under normal circumstances.\n\nI am assigning a 25% probability, which acknowledges the serious possibility of a 'Yes' outcome due to the crisis context, while still weighing the 'No' outcome as significantly more likely due to institutional and personal inertia. \n\nMy probability is not lower because the urgency of a snap election is a powerful catalyst that can override normal political calendars. The existence of a 'draft' movement, even if just a media report, suggests a real possibility. \n\nMy probability is not higher because 13 days is a remarkably short period to finalize such a decision. There could be significant internal party opposition, or Han himself may be genuinely reluctant to run, requiring more time for persuasion than is available before the deadline. The 'draft' movement could also be a trial balloon that fails to gain sufficient traction.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible reports emerge of key PPP factions formally endorsing Han, or if his office schedules a major press conference. I would decrease my forecast if Han or his aides publicly deny any intention to run, or if a credible rival candidate from the PPP emerges.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Han Duck-soo announce his candidacy for South Korean president before May 5, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Chosun Daily: [Support grows in PPP to draft Acting President Han for June election](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464554)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Han Duck-soo announces his candidacy for president of South Korea before May 5, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
