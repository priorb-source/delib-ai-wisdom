    "review": "My initial forecast (10% Yes) was in stark opposition to Forecaster 2 (90% Yes) and Forecaster 3 (95% Yes). The core of our disagreement stems from our interpretation of the most likely path to change. Both other forecasters built their analysis on the premise of 'institutional inertia' and the extremely long timeline required for a formal scientific review and change of recommendation. They are correct that such a process takes years, not weeks. However, I believe they underweight the resolution criteria, which allow for a 'No' outcome if the recommendation is simply removed or the page is taken offline. My initial analysis focused on this path, driven by the clear, top-down political intent from the HHS Secretary, which I saw as sufficient to overcome inertia for a simple administrative action.",
    "rationale": "I find the other forecasters' reasoning about the slowness of formal scientific review to be convincing, but largely irrelevant to the most probable scenarios. The key evidence remains the HHS Secretary's direct statement of intent to have the CDC *stop recommending* fluoridation, corroborated by parallel actions at the EPA and FDA. This signals a high-priority, coordinated political directive.\n\nHowever, the other forecasters' arguments about institutional pressures did cause me to reconsider the friction involved in even a simple administrative change. My initial analysis may have underestimated the potential for immediate legal challenges (e.g., under the Administrative Procedure Act) or significant internal bureaucratic resistance that could successfully delay the removal or modification of the webpage past the July 1, 2025 deadline. The existence of a strong scientific consensus supporting the current rule provides ammunition for those who would seek to delay the change through procedural or legal means.\n\nTherefore, while I maintain that a 'No' outcome is more likely than not because of the immense political will from the top, I am revising my forecast to better account for the non-trivial chance that these delaying tactics succeed. I am moving my forecast up from 10% to 35%. This reflects my continued belief that a politically motivated administrative change is the most likely event, but acknowledges a significant (~1-in-3) chance that institutional friction and legal headwinds prevent this change from being implemented by the resolution date.",
