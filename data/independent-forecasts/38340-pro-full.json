  "information": "As of early June 2025, Sudan has not ratified the AfCFTA agreement nor submitted its Provisional Schedule of Tariff Concessions. The country is in an ongoing civil war, resulting in fragmented government, the absence of a functioning legislature, and suspension from the African Union (AU). Despite the conflict, a draft national AfCFTA implementation strategy for Sudan was previously reviewed and validated by stakeholders in a process supported by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).\n\nAcross Africa, 47 of the 54 signatory nations had ratified the AfCFTA agreement as of July 2024. However, overall implementation of the trade area since its 2021 launch has been described as sluggish. According to trade policy analysts, key impediments include production-related challenges like low industrial output, poor infrastructure, and non-tariff barriers. The original goal of removing tariffs on 90% of goods has been pushed back to 2034.\n\nA recent UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) report highlighted the AfCFTA's potential to boost trade-led growth and increase Africa's GDP by 1.2% by 2045 with full implementation. Other regional developments include a forum in Zambia focused on digital trade integration, an emphasis on arbitration for resolving trade disputes, and the promotion of the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) to facilitate transactions in local currencies. Meanwhile, Nigeria has ratified the agreement, and South Africa and Lesotho are strengthening bilateral trade ties to advance AfCFTA goals.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The deadline is July 1, 2025, and today is June 6, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The state of civil war means there is no functioning, recognized legislative body to ratify international treaties.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing civil war and resulting political instability continue. The country lacks a functioning, unified government and legislature capable of undertaking the formal process of ratifying an international agreement. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without ratification.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and comprehensive peace agreement is reached within the next few days, leading to the immediate formation of a government of national unity. This new government, in a symbolic move to signal economic reconstruction and reintegration with the continent, uses an emergency decree or a rapidly convened body to ratify the AfCFTA agreement just before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly driven by the current political and security situation in Sudan. The research indicates the country is in an ongoing civil war, resulting in a fragmented government, the absence of a functioning legislature, and suspension from the African Union (AU). Ratifying an international treaty is a formal state function that is impossible to execute under these conditions. The deadline of July 1, 2025, is less than a month away, a timeframe that would be challenging for even a stable government to complete such a process, let alone one in a state of collapse. While a draft implementation strategy was previously reviewed, this indicates past intent, not current capability. The current reality of conflict is the single most important factor, making ratification before the deadline practically impossible.\n\nMy probability is not zero because unforeseeable 'black swan' events, such as a sudden, externally-brokered peace accord, are theoretically possible, though extremely unlikely. A new, unified government could potentially expedite ratification as a symbolic gesture.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the barriers are immense. The civil war is deeply entrenched, and there are no current indicators of an imminent resolution. Furthermore, Sudan's suspension from the AU adds another layer of political and procedural complexity to engaging with an AU-led agreement.\n\nI would update my forecast towards 'Yes' only upon seeing credible evidence of an immediate cessation of hostilities and the formation of a unified, internationally recognized government that explicitly states its intent to ratify the agreement urgently. Without this, the forecast will remain extremely low.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
