  "information": "Several airlines announced the resumption or launch of new flights to Beirut for the summer 2025 season. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) is resuming service from Copenhagen and Stockholm in June. Emirates resumed its daily service from Dubai in February 2025 and added a second daily flight in April. Air France and its subsidiary Transavia also resumed flights from Paris in February. Other confirmed additions include a Wizz Air flight from Abu Dhabi starting June 4, a seasonal Middle East Airlines (MEA) route to Barcelona from June 26, and a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw beginning July 1, 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (roughly 41 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the current scheduled network likely remains below the >51-destination threshold absent further resumptions",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Cross-border hostilities persist or worsen, leading some European and regional carriers to delay resumptions or pull summer service from schedules. Seasonal leisure routes (Turkey, Greece, Egypt) and Saudi secondary cities stay thin or are removed from schedules, keeping the FlightsFrom destination count in the mid-to-high 40s on/after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Security risk stabilizes and the summer schedule proceeds: multiple seasonal Mediterranean leisure routes (Turkey resorts, Greek islands/EU secondaries), additional Saudi secondary cities, and a few more European resumptions (e.g., Belgium/Germany/France secondaries, Caucasus) are present in carriers’ July schedules. With SAS (CPH, ARN), LOT (WAW), Wizz (AUH), Transavia/Air France (ORY/CDG), MEA (BCN) and others, the FlightsFrom listing tips to 52+ destinations by early July.",
    "rationale": "Key points I’m weighing:\n- Threshold and timing: The bar is >51 destinations as listed on FlightsFrom when checked on/after July 1. Schedules for summer are largely loaded now; big swings usually come from security-driven suspensions/resumptions rather than routine schedule tweaks this close in.\n- Status quo baseline: Beirut historically clears this threshold in stable times. But post-2023 conflict, many carriers suspended service. By early 2025, resumptions are happening, yet tourism demand and war-risk insurance remain headwinds. My conservative reconstruction of the current/near-term network suggests something around the high 40s, possibly just under 50 destinations, before the final wave of summer seasonals.\n- Positive momentum (from RA and broader context): RA notes concrete additions before/around July 1: SAS returning CPH and ARN in June; Emirates already back and up-gauged; Air France and Transavia back to Paris; Wizz Abu Dhabi (from Jun 4); MEA’s seasonal Barcelona (from Jun 26); LOT Warsaw (from Jul 1). These are real, additive destinations. If the baseline were already ~48, these could push the total just over 51.\n- Offsetting risks (why not higher): The New Arab piece and sector commentary point to fragile tourism demand and security uncertainty. A modest escalation could prompt schedule removals or temporary suspensions right around July 1, clipping marginal destinations (especially seasonal leisure and secondary Saudi/Iraqi points). Also, some destinations I tentatively counted could still be absent (e.g., select Germany/Italy/France secondaries, Caucasus, Egypt leisure, Oman), and if a few of those aren’t in the schedule, the total likely sits below 52.\n- Why not lower: The visible wave of resumptions by European legacies (AF/Transavia, SAS, LOT) plus strong GCC connectivity (Emirates, QR, Gulf Air, Kuwait Airways/Jazeera, likely Air Arabia to SHJ, and MEA’s regional network) makes a high-40s count plausible already, with reasonable upside from seasonal Turkey/Europe leisure and Saudi secondary markets. It would not take many additional summer routes to tip >51.\nUpdate triggers:\n- Upward: Verified additions to FlightsFrom BEY page of multiple seasonal Mediterranean routes (Turkey resorts, Greek islands), extra Saudi secondary cities, confirmation of services like Muscat, Tbilisi, Yerevan, Tunis/Casablanca, and any further European resumptions (e.g., Brussels, Lyon/Nice/Marseille expansions).\n- Downward: Any renewed escalation in the Israel–Hezbollah theater, insurer pullbacks, NOTAMs/war-risk advisories, or airline announcements removing Beirut from July schedules—especially if they affect seasonal European/Turkish/Egyptian leisure or secondary Saudi/Iraqi points that are the marginal routes needed to clear 51.",
