    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my prior reasoning: anchor to the ~38% U.S. base rate in the 200–300 band, note recent non-U.S. occupants at #250, and incorporate the reported decline in overall U.S. share. They also surface similar update triggers (USD strength, U.S. equity outperformance vs. commodity/EM rallies). The only incremental angle is an emphasis on July 1 sitting at the cusp of any Q1–Q2 seasonal weakness; I view that seasonality as weak evidence and not enough to materially move the forecast. I don’t see new, concrete data (e.g., a current cluster of U.S. names around 248–252) that would justify a shift. Overall, their arguments are consistent and sensible, but they don’t add substantive new information that would change my view.",
    "rationale": "I continue to weigh: (1) Base rate ~38% U.S. in the 200–300 range; (2) current snapshots at #250 are non-U.S. (Apr 30 Italy; May 29 Russia); (3) a reported downtrend in U.S. share in the top 500 to ~35%; (4) roughly one month of runway with day-to-day volatility that could flip the occupant. The balance still points modestly below the 38% base due to the status quo and trend, but not much lower given the high churn risk and potential late-June U.S. equity/USD tailwinds. I place low weight on seasonality. With no new evidence of a U.S. cluster near the cutoff, I maintain my prior estimate.",
