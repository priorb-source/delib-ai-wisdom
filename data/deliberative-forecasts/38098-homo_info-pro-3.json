    "review": "All three forecasters agree that a 'Yes' outcome is unlikely due to the short timeframe and lack of preparatory activity. My initial analysis was based on this absence of positive evidence. Forecaster 2 introduced an important point about the difficulty of the race, noting that incumbent Lindsey Graham has a key endorsement from Donald Trump. This strengthens the case for 'No' but makes their 15% forecast seem surprisingly high. Forecaster 3 provided the most compelling new information: that Ralph Norman is reportedly focused on a run for Governor and his office has explicitly denied any plans for a Senate run. This is a crucial piece of evidence I had not considered, as it provides a clear reason for the lack of Senate campaign activity and points to a definitive alternative plan.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast based on the new, highly compelling evidence presented by Forecaster 3. My initial 3% forecast was based on the absence of evidence for a Senate run. The revelation that Norman is actively exploring a different statewide race (Governor) and has had his office issue an explicit denial about the Senate race constitutes strong, direct evidence for a 'No' outcome. It moves the analysis from 'he is not preparing for a Senate run' to 'he is actively pursuing a different goal.' This significantly lowers the probability of a surprise reversal and an announcement in the next month. Forecaster 2's point about the Trump endorsement for Graham further reinforces this conclusion; it would be strategically illogical for Norman to abandon his gubernatorial plans to launch a last-minute, uphill battle against a Trump-backed incumbent. The confluence of these factors—a clear alternative ambition, an explicit denial, and a formidable incumbent—makes the likelihood of a Senate candidacy declaration before July 1 vanishingly small. I am therefore revising my forecast downward from 3% to 1% to reflect this new, stronger evidence. The remaining 1% accounts for the small but non-zero possibility of a radical, unforeseen shift in the political landscape.",
