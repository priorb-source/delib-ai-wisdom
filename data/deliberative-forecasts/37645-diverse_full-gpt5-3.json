    "review": "Both forecasters’ arguments largely align with my baseline: the mid‑April confidence vote removed the constitutional trigger, protests appear to be losing steam, and senior officials emphasize a stable majority. They emphasize the short time window (≈47 days) and the political costs of reversing course so soon after forming a government. Forecaster 3 leans on Vučić’s May 14 “within ten days” comment to keep the option live; that’s a fair signal, though consistent with his pattern of tactical ambiguity. One point neither explicitly addressed is the procedural timing constraint: Serbian parliamentary elections are typically held 45–60 days after the decree calling them. Therefore, any announcement before July 1 would imply an August election window—historically uncommon and potentially unattractive—slightly lowering odds relative to a generic “snap sometime later” scenario. On the other hand, the opposition’s fragmentation and potential ruling‑party advantage in low‑turnout conditions could make an August vote strategically tempting, which is the best argument for a non‑trivial tail. Overall, I find their reasoning sound and close to my view, with a modest case for a slightly higher probability than my initial estimate due to the continued “ten‑day decision” signaling and the possibility of opportunistic timing.",
    "rationale": "Key facts: (1) New cabinet confirmed in mid‑April; constitutional snap trigger removed. (2) Officials stress a stable majority and no need for early elections. (3) Protests have waned, and the opposition is fragmented. (4) Vučić on May 14 again floated a “decision within ten days,” keeping optionality open.\n\nMechanics: Calling elections before July 1 would, under Serbia’s usual 45–60 day window, place the vote in mid‑to‑late August. That timing is unusual and likely suboptimal, which dampens the probability of a pre‑July 1 announcement if the government prefers a September/October vote.\n\nBalance of incentives: The fresh government and lack of legal compulsion argue strongly for No. However, Vučić’s pattern of opportunistic snap polls, opposition fragmentation, and potential low‑turnout advantages create a credible tail for an August election call. The May 14 “ten days” remark marginally upgrades the chance that they keep the option genuinely live rather than purely rhetorical.\n\nUpdate: I slightly raise my estimate from 12% to 14% to reflect the continued signaling that an election remains under consideration and the plausible strategic appeal of an August vote despite its drawbacks. I would move up further on signs of coalition fracture, a major scandal, or a sustained protest resurgence; I would move down if the “ten‑day” window lapses with firm commitments to govern on a longer agenda and no preparatory legal steps toward dissolution.",
