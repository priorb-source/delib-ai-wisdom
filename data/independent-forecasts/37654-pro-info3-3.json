  "information": "Breaking up a federal agency typically requires either legislation passed by Congress or an executive reorganization plan. Historically, similar executive reorganizations have taken between two and six months to progress from concept to a signed executive order, following legal and administrative vetting. For a legislative approach, while the House of Representatives could pass relevant language in an appropriations bill in June, Senate action would likely not occur until mid-July at the earliest. Past large-scale government reorganizations, such as the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, have been complex processes that take longer than a month and a half to formalize.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "47 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The objective is currently marked as 'in progress'. If this status remains unchanged until the deadline, the question will resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The process to break up NOAA, whether through executive order or congressional legislation, is not finalized by the July 1, 2025 deadline. The objective's status on the tracker spreadsheet therefore remains 'in progress' or is updated to another status other than 'complete'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The presidential administration successfully fast-tracks an executive reorganization plan or a piece of legislation is passed and signed into law that officially breaks up NOAA. The moderators of the Project 2025 Tracker update the spreadsheet to mark the objective as 'complete' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the significant procedural and temporal obstacles to completing a major government reorganization within the short, 47-day timeframe. Good forecasting gives significant weight to the status quo, and the current status of 'in progress' is unlikely to change to 'complete' so quickly. The research provided indicates that both potential paths for this action are unlikely to conclude in time. A legislative approach would almost certainly not pass both houses of Congress before the July 1 deadline, with Senate action not expected until mid-July at the earliest. An executive reorganization plan, while faster, historically takes two to six months to finalize, which is longer than the time remaining. The complexity of dismantling an entire federal agency like NOAA, with its broad scientific and regulatory mandate, further suggests a longer timeline than is available. My probability is not lower than 5% because there is a small chance that a highly motivated administration could expedite the executive order process, bypassing typical timelines if the groundwork has already been laid. My probability is not higher because the procedural hurdles and historical precedents for such a large-scale government action strongly indicate that completion in under two months is an outlier event. I would raise my forecast upon news that an executive order has been finalized and is awaiting a signature, or that key congressional leaders have reached an agreement to fast-track a bill. I would lower it upon official statements pushing the timeline for this objective to later in the year.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBreaking up a federal agency typically requires either legislation passed by Congress or an executive reorganization plan.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
