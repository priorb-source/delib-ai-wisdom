    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days. Initial jobless claims data for the week ended June 21, 2025 will typically be released by the Department of Labor on June 26, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Initial jobless claims remain near current levels, which in a stable labor market typically range between 200,000-225,000, with the outcome depending on which side of 220,000 the week's reading falls.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The labor market remains stable or strengthens slightly, with limited layoff activity. Claims for the week ended June 21 come in at 220,000 or below, continuing a pattern of relatively low unemployment claims consistent with recent trends. This could reflect ongoing economic resilience with no major corporate downsizing announcements.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The labor market shows signs of weakening with increased layoff activity, seasonal factors create an upward spike, or there are significant job cuts announced in major sectors like technology, retail, or manufacturing. Claims exceed 220,000, potentially reaching 225,000-235,000, which while elevated, would still be within historically normal ranges for a moderating labor market.",
    "rationale": "Without specific current data from my research assistant, I must rely on general knowledge of initial jobless claims patterns. Historically, initial jobless claims exhibit significant week-to-week volatility, typically ranging between 190,000-240,000 during periods of economic stability.\n\nThe threshold of 220,000 is noteworthy because it represents a middle-to-upper level within the normal range observed in recent years. This is neither an extreme high requiring a significant economic shock, nor an extreme low requiring exceptional labor market strength.\n\nKey factors supporting a moderate probability:\n- Weekly volatility means any stable average around 210,000-215,000 would have roughly 40-45% chance of exceeding 220,000 in any given week\n- The question requires exceeding (not meeting or exceeding) 220,000, creating a slightly higher bar\n- June typically doesn't have major seasonal distortions for initial claims\n- Without evidence of significant deterioration or improvement, status quo bias suggests continuation of recent patterns\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: there's no information suggesting labor market deterioration, major layoff waves, or economic shocks that would push claims significantly above recent averages.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: 220,000 is not an unusually high threshold, and normal weekly volatility makes it quite plausible to exceed this level even in a stable labor market environment.\n\nI would update higher if: reports emerged of significant layoff announcements, weakening economic indicators, or if current claims were already trending above 220,000. I would update lower if: recent weeks showed claims consistently in the 180,000-200,000 range, or if economic data suggested strengthening labor market conditions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 exceed 220,000?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer. The claim requests a determination of basic eligibility for the Unemployment Insurance program.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 is greater than 220,000 according to [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA).&#x20;\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
