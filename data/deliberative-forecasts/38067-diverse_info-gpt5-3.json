    "review": "Both forecasters lean heavily on category-level base rates and the Foundation’s equity push but explicitly lack (and thus mis-specify) the 2025 finalist slate. Based on the linked Eater list, it appears Cassie Piuma is the only woman finalist for Outstanding Chef this year. That materially lowers the prior relative to their assumed 2–3 women out of five. Their 45% rests on a finalist composition that doesn’t hold for 2025. The 2018–2022 run of women winners is informative but small-sample and offset by 2023–2024 male winners; absent evidence Piuma is a clear frontrunner, a coin-flip is not justified with a 1-of-5 gender split.",
    "rationale": "Key inputs: (1) Slate composition: Piuma appears to be the sole woman finalist in Outstanding Chef. A neutral starting point on that alone is ~20%. (2) Organizational context: JBF’s equity emphasis can nudge that up modestly, but it has not guaranteed female winners in this category (2023–2024 both men). (3) Candidate strength: Sarma/Piuma is highly regarded, which warrants an upward adjustment, but I see no credible signals she is the consensus favorite. Given those, I keep a modest premium over the naive share-of-finalists baseline but stay well below one-in-three to reflect typical outcome concentration among perceived frontrunners. The other forecasters’ arguments don’t add new, slate-specific evidence; they rely on a finalist distribution that isn’t present this year, so I do not update upward.",
