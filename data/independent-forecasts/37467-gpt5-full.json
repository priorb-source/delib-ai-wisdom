  "information": "Beyond Meat's financial results for the first quarter of 2025 showed a 9.1% year-over-year decline in net revenues to $68.7 million. The company reported a net loss of $52.9 million and a gross loss of $1.1 million, resulting in a gross margin of -1.5%. While the company's international business revenue grew, its U.S. retail channel revenue fell by 15.4%. Citing weak consumer demand and macroeconomic volatility, Beyond Meat withdrew its annual sales forecast for 2025 and issued a revised outlook for the second quarter with expected net revenues between $80 million and $85 million.\n\nAs of March 2025, Beyond Meat had $116 million in cash on hand. The company's liabilities included $1.15 billion in convertible bonds maturing in 2027, which were reported to be trading at 17 cents on the dollar. On May 7, 2025, the company announced it had secured a new $100 million senior secured financing facility. The loan has an initial term of 4.75 years with an interest rate of 12% until February 2030, payable in kind, meaning interest is added to the loan's principal instead of being paid in cash during this period.\n\nIn response to its financial performance, Beyond Meat has implemented several operational changes, including a 17% workforce reduction for non-production staff and a suspension of its operations in China. Management stated its strategic priorities include restoring product distribution within the U.S. market and improving consumer perception through new marketing campaigns. The stated long-term goal for the company is to achieve EBITDA-positive operations by the end of 2026.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Beyond Meat does not file for bankruptcy protection before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The newly announced $100 million senior secured facility closes and is available for liquidity, interest is PIK so there is no near‑term cash interest burden, and the company funds operations using existing cash ($116 million as of March 2025) plus working-capital management and cost cuts. With no imminent maturities (2027 converts) and Q2 revenues still expected ($80–85m guidance), the firm rides out the next ~2 months without a filing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The financing fails to close or triggers tight covenants that are breached, vendors sharply tighten terms causing a liquidity crunch, or an adverse shock (product recall, large customer loss, legal or regulatory hit) precipitates a rapid cash shortfall. The board elects to pursue a prepackaged Chapter 11 to restructure the distressed 2027 converts (trading ~17 cents) and stabilize operations before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Status quo favors No: firms rarely file within weeks of securing fresh senior financing, especially PIK structures that conserve cash. Beyond Meat ended Q1 with $116m cash, guided Q2 revenues to $80–85m, and just announced a $100m senior secured facility at 12% PIK with a 4.75‑year term. Its 2027 converts are deeply distressed (~17 cents), and fundamentals are weak (Q1 net loss $52.9m, gross margin -1.5%, U.S. retail down 15.4%). However, none of these imply an unavoidable, immediate cash wall before July 1. With no near‑term maturities and incremental liquidity, a filing in the next ~7 weeks would typically require an acute negative catalyst (financing failure, covenant default, severe operational shock) or a deliberate fast‑track prepack decision—both possible but not the base case.\nWhy not higher: The new facility materially reduces short‑term filing risk, interest is PIK (no cash drain), and the converts mature in 2027. Even with ongoing losses, the company likely has runway beyond July 1. Sudden bankruptcies in this setup are uncommon absent a trigger.\nWhy not lower: Financial trajectory remains poor (negative gross margin, continued losses, withdrawn 2025 guidance), bond prices imply high eventual default risk, and the lender could have covenants or milestones. Vendor confidence or working‑capital strain could worsen quickly. A prepack to address the converts is conceivable if management judges the new money insufficient.\nKey update signals:\n- Up (higher bankruptcy probability): financing does not close or is partially unavailable; disclosure of tight liquidity or covenant breaches; vendors reduce terms materially; auditor going‑concern emphasis without mitigating actions; unexpected shock (recall, litigation, major customer exit).\n- Down (lower probability): confirmed closing and draw of the $100m facility with light covenants; improved gross margin/EBITDA trajectory; vendor support or extended terms; additional cost reductions or asset sales increasing liquidity.\nNetting these, I put extra weight on the status quo outcome and assign a low but non‑trivial tail risk for an adverse trigger within the short window.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beyond Meat file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeyond Meat has had several years of losses and in the most recent quarter it [posted](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial) a loss from operations of almost $38 million.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Beyond Meat, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBeyond Meat's financial results for the first quarter of 2025 showed a 9.1% year-over-year decline in net revenues to $68.7 million.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
