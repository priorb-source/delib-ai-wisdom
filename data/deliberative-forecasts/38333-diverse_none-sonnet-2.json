    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I underweighted in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that major statewide campaigns rarely materialize from consideration to launch in under a month without visible preparatory signals. Forecaster 3 astutely notes that the research assistant's report showing 'no additional information available' is itself a significant negative signal - if movement were happening toward a June announcement, we'd likely be seeing staff hires, exploratory committee formation, or event scheduling leaks. Both also raise the important strategic point that most 2026 gubernatorial candidates announce later in the off-year, not in June 2025. The one-month silence since the Axios article, which I noted but didn't fully process, is particularly telling. If Suarez were building toward a June announcement, the typical pre-announcement infrastructure and buzz would be generating news by now. Forecaster 2's point about his brief 2024 presidential campaign potentially creating donor/personal caution is also well-taken context I hadn't fully considered.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating downward from 30% to 20%. The key factors driving this revision are: (1) The complete absence of preparatory signals over the past month is more significant than I initially weighted - major announcements don't materialize in a vacuum; (2) The extremely short 26-day timeline makes logistics challenging for a credible statewide campaign; (3) Strategic considerations favor later announcements for 2026 races. However, I'm not going as low as 10% because the May Axios report does establish genuine consideration from a credible source, surprise announcements do occasionally happen in politics, and 26 days is technically sufficient time. The 20% forecast appropriately balances acknowledging the strong status quo bias and logistical challenges while not completely dismissing the documented consideration and remaining time window.",
