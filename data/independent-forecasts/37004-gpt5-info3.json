  "information": "Analysis of voter demographics and commitment levels reveals differing patterns. Among declared voters, 76% of Conservative supporters describe themselves as \"very committed\" to their choice, compared to 63% for Liberal supporters. The Conservative Party holds a narrow lead among voters under the age of 35, with 39% support versus 38% for the Liberals. Advanced voting has seen high participation, with over 2 million ballots cast on the first day. No further major debates or campaign-wide events are scheduled before the election.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 week (advance polls have begun; results typically known on election night).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the Conservatives win the national popular vote.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A late-breaking consolidation of center-left voters behind the Liberals (and some strategic switching from NDP/Greens) lifts the Liberal popular vote just past the Conservatives, aided by exceptionally strong turnout in urban and suburban cores and a 4–6 point polling/turnout error against the Conservatives.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives’ large and durable national lead holds through Election Day; their higher share of “very committed” supporters translates into superior turnout, while NDP retains enough vote to keep the Liberals from overtaking the Conservatives in the national vote share.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: For many months leading into 2025, the Conservatives have held a sizable national polling lead over the Liberals, and in both 2019 and 2021 they still won the popular vote even when the national race was tighter. With advance voting already underway and no more debates, the opportunity for large persuasion shocks is limited. That status quo strongly favors a Conservative popular-vote win.\nEvidence from the research assistant: (1) Commitment advantage — 76% of Conservative supporters are “very committed” vs. 63% for Liberals, implying a turnout edge. (2) Age splits — Conservatives narrowly lead among under-35s (39–38), which, if true, complements their typical strength among older voters and reduces the risk of a youth-driven Liberal/NDP surge. (3) High advance turnout — over 2 million ballots on day one means much of the outcome is already being banked; with no remaining major campaign events, late shifts are less likely to be decisive.\nWhy not higher: Even late in a campaign, a 3–5 point national polling error or a rapid anti-Conservative consolidation could still occur, particularly if progressive voters coalesce behind the Liberals in Ontario and Quebec. Higher-than-expected youth/urban turnout or a late negative story could narrow the gap enough to flip the popular vote. Canada has seen meaningful late movement before, and multi-party dynamics complicate translation from polls to final shares.\nWhy not lower: The Conservative lead has been large and persistent; winning the popular vote is easier for them than winning the seat count, and their turnout fundamentals (commitment advantage, fewer undecideds) look favorable. With no debates left and advance votes already high, the window for a dramatic reversal is short.\nWhat would move me up: Final-week trackers continuing to show a double-digit Conservative lead; evidence that NDP support is holding rather than collapsing to the Liberals; advance turnout patterns strongest in CPC-leaning regions. What would move me down: High-quality national and Ontario/Quebec polls showing rapid late convergence (e.g., CPC lead shrinking to ≤3 points), clear signs of strategic voting taking hold, or credible reports of unusually high youth/urban turnout favoring Liberals/NDP.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
