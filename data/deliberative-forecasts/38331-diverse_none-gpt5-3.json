    "review": "Both forecasters emphasized dual inertia: (1) entrenched censorship policies in the seven states, and (2) Wikipedia’s reliance on stable, well-sourced consensus. They argue that in <1 month, neither real-world unblocking nor a justified Wikipedia reclassification is likely. Forecaster 3 also notes admin discretion to annul in case of edit wars, reducing risk of a spurious ‘No’ via vandalism. I hadn’t explicitly weighed how short the horizon is against Wikipedia’s consensus standards; that does push the odds upward. However, I think they underweight two Wikipedia-specific risks: (a) Venezuela’s status is historically more intermittent/contested and could be reclassified without a real-world policy shift; and (b) Russia’s status could be reframed (e.g., from blocked to heavily restricted/partially accessible) if editors surface new sources. Admin discretion to annul doesn’t increase the chance of ‘Yes’; it just diverts some vandalism-driven ‘No’ outcomes into annulments, which are still not ‘Yes.’ Their 93–97% feels too high given these vulnerabilities.",
    "rationale": "Short window and policy inertia across China, Iran, North Korea, Turkmenistan, and Myanmar make removals from the “Current” list very unlikely in June. The two real points of fragility remain Venezuela (history of intermittent/ISP-specific measures; editors could decide it doesn’t meet a “currently blocked” threshold) and, secondarily, Russia (potential reclassification or sourcing updates). The Wikipedia dependency also adds a small structural risk independent of real-world policy. Forecasters 2 and 3 make a strong case that such changes are rare and require consensus with citations, and the timeframe is short. That persuades me to move up from my initial 75%. But I remain below their 93–97% because a single-country removal flips this to ‘No,’ and Venezuela’s classification is plausibly the subject of a mid-June cleanup edit tied to fresh NetBlocks/press citations. I’m updating upward to reflect the short horizon and consensus inertia, but keep a nontrivial tail for a Venezuela (or Russia) reclassification and minor Wikipedia-process risk.",
