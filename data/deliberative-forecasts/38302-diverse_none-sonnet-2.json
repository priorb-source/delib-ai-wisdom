    "review": "All three forecasts converged remarkably at 68-70%, suggesting strong agreement on the core factors. Forecaster 2 makes excellent points about policy time lags - stimulus measures typically take months to impact CPI, which supports the Yes case. Forecaster 3 raises two important considerations I underweighted: (1) May Labor Day holiday effects on services/travel prices could provide upside surprise, and (2) we're likely dealing with small negative numbers (-0.1% to -0.3%) where pork price volatility or minor shifts can flip the sign. The pork/hog cycle volatility is a genuine wild card I hadn't sufficiently considered. However, I'm also reassured by the convergence - three independent analysts reaching similar conclusions using similar logic suggests we're appropriately weighing the momentum from three consecutive months against the risks of reversal.",
    "rationale": "The three-month deflationary trend remains the dominant signal, driven by structural factors (property crisis, weak consumption, cautious households) that won't resolve quickly. Policy stimulus has time lags, so recent measures likely haven't filtered through to May CPI yet. However, two factors warrant modest downward adjustment: (1) May Labor Day holiday (May 1) is a major consumption/travel period in China that could boost services prices more than initially considered, and (2) when dealing with potentially small negative numbers, volatility in food components (especially pork) can more easily push the reading into positive territory. Base effects from May 2024 aren't particularly favorable for continued deflation. These considerations add meaningful uncertainty around the zero threshold. Nevertheless, the momentum argument remains compelling - once deflation persists for three months, the underlying dynamics typically don't reverse in a single month without clear catalysts. I'm adjusting down slightly to account for holiday effects and near-zero volatility, but maintaining conviction that continuation is more likely than reversal.",
