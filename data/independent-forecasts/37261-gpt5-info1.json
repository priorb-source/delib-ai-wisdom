  "information": "The '50501' movement, a decentralized organization originating from a Reddit forum, planned nationwide protests on May 1, 2025, coinciding with International Workers' Day. The protests were organized to oppose the Trump administration's policies on immigration and labor. The movement's website listed over 1,000 events across all 50 states, with major demonstrations expected in Washington D.C., Chicago, Denver, Seattle, and Los Angeles. Organizations supporting the protests included the Political Revolution PAC and the Service Employees International Union. News reports following the event stated that over 1,100 protests took place under the '50501' banner across the U.S. and worldwide.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 months (≈59 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Carnegie Global Protest Tracker does not add any new U.S. entry by July 1, 2025 with a start date after the question’s launch, or any added U.S. event is dated outside the window or is not tagged/assessed as 10,000+ participants.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The tracker adds an entry such as the May 1, 2025 (\"50501\") May Day protests or a large pro-Palestine/anti-war or Supreme Court–related protest wave in May/June, with a start date in the window and an assessed size of 10,000+ participants.",
    "rationale": "Frame and base rates: The Carnegie Global Protest Tracker typically logs only major U.S. protest waves (e.g., Women’s March 2017, George Floyd 2020) and does not add entries frequently. A rough base rate might be around one U.S. addition per year, implying a modest probability in any random two‑month window. That anchors the prior below 30%.\nNear‑term catalysts: May–June often bring sizable protests: May Day/immigration-labor actions, pro‑Palestine/anti‑war mobilizations (e.g., around May 15/Nakba), potential large demonstrations tied to late‑June Supreme Court decisions, and other Trump‑era political flashpoints. These raise the odds above the naive base rate because they routinely generate 10,000+ crowds in major cities.\nTracker behavior and timing risk: Even if large protests occur, resolution depends on Carnegie choosing to create a U.S. entry (they do not catalog every march) and doing so by July 1. They sometimes post with lags of weeks. The status quo as of May 2 is that the criteria are not yet satisfied; if nothing changes on the tracker, the question resolves No.\nResearch assistant input: The RA reports a nationwide “50501” May 1, 2025 action with over 1,000 events and support from major organizations, implying some city turnouts exceeded 10,000. If accurate and deemed a single significant protest wave, this is a strong candidate for inclusion with a May 1 start date, which would satisfy the criterion (assuming the question launched before May 1). However, the branding (“50501”) and scale claims are uncertain, and Carnegie may choose not to log it as a distinct U.S. entry.\nWhy not higher: Uncertainty that Carnegie will add any new U.S. entry at all in this short window; possibility that they consider ongoing protest waves as continuations with earlier start dates; potential update lag past July 1; and uncertainty about the RA’s reported May 1 action and whether Carnegie will treat it as a qualifying event.\nWhy not lower: Multiple plausible triggers for 10k+ protests in May–June, plus the RA‑reported May Day protests provide at least one concrete, time‑appropriate candidate. If Carnegie does add any U.S. protest in this window, it will likely meet or exceed 10,000 by their own significance criteria.\nWhat would move me up: Credible media confirming 10k+ turnouts for May 1 in a major U.S. city, indications that Carnegie has recently updated other countries’ entries (showing active maintenance), or any sign they have added or plan to add a U.S. entry for May–June events.\nWhat would move me down: Evidence that the tracker has not been updated recently or is de‑emphasizing U.S. entries; confirmation that the question launched after May 1 (disqualifying the RA‑reported event); or lack of major U.S. mobilizations through mid‑June.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
