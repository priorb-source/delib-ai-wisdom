    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides critically important concrete financial data that I lacked: $225.6M cash as of January 31, 2025, only $3M quarterly burn in Q4 (down from $31M in Q3), and crucially, NO DEBT MATURITIES UNTIL 2028. This last point is especially significant - the absence of near-term debt obligations eliminates the primary forcing mechanism for bankruptcy. With 75+ quarters of runway at current burn rates, bankruptcy in 57 days would require a black swan event. Forecaster 3's point about the NYSE non-compliance notice is noted but relates to stock price rather than operational distress, and the company's stated plan for a reverse stock split suggests routine management rather than crisis. However, Forecaster 3's 12% seems too high given the specific cash and debt maturity data. The main weakness in Forecaster 2's analysis is that the data is 3+ months old (January 31 to May 5), though dramatic deterioration in such a short period with no public warning signs seems unlikely.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast DOWN from 5% to 3%. Forecaster 2's specific financial data - particularly the combination of substantial cash reserves ($225.6M), dramatically improved burn rate ($3M/quarter), and no debt maturities until 2028 - fundamentally strengthens the case against bankruptcy. These are not speculative points but concrete figures from the Q4 report. For bankruptcy to occur in the remaining 57 days with this financial profile would require an extraordinary unforeseen event: massive hidden liabilities, fraud, complete operational collapse, or similar black swan scenarios. The base rate for such events is very low. I'm not going as low as Forecaster 2's 2% primarily because there is a 3+ month gap between the reported data (January 31) and today (May 5), and while unlikely, some material deterioration or undisclosed issue could theoretically exist. The absence of any public distress signals (going concern warnings, executive departures, creditor actions) during this period supports the lower probability, but maintaining a small buffer for uncertainty seems prudent.",
