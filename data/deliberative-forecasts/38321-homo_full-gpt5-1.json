    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core points I used—public White House confirmation, allied echoes, strong institutional base rate for presidential attendance, and the short time to event. New/useful additions: (1) an explicit discount due to minor inconsistencies in the research assistant’s summary (SecGen attribution, G7 location) without undermining the central claim; (2) calling out summit postponement/move-out-of-June as a distinct tail risk relevant to resolution; (3) concrete operational indicators that would further raise confidence (detailed schedule, bilateral list, pre-positioning, pool reports). I find their reasoning sound and aligned with historical patterns. Their slightly higher probabilities reflect a reasonable aggregation of small tail risks rather than any disagreement on direction.",
    "rationale": "The modal outcome is attendance: on-record White House confirmation, corroboration by hosts/allies, and the diplomatic/instrumental value for Trump to press defense-spending demands face-to-face. With ~3 weeks left, logistics and security for a POTUS visit are typically locked in, and U.S. presidents nearly always attend NATO summits. I retain a modest tail for: Trump’s idiosyncratic schedule changes; low but non-zero health risk; acute domestic/international crises; security/travel disruptions; or a summit postponement/slip out of June (which would resolve No). The minor inconsistencies in the assistant’s report warrant a small credibility discount but do not materially alter the base case. Balancing these, I update slightly upward from 88% to 91%, aligning more closely with base rates and the strength of official confirmations while preserving a realistic tail for late changes. Up triggers: publication of detailed presidential schedule for The Hague, visible USSS/logistics, or wheels-up/arrival. Down triggers: credible health/crisis reports, conditional language from the White House, or chatter about postponement/security threats.",
