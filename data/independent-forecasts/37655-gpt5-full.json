  "information": "Under Ukrainian law, specifically Article 19 of the Law “On the Legal Regime of Martial Law,” scheduling or holding national elections is forbidden while martial law is in effect. On May 15, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) voted to prolong martial law and general mobilization until at least August 6, 2025. The parliamentary rules of procedure also stipulate that once martial law is lifted, the date for the next presidential election must be set no less than 90 days in advance.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's office officially denied media reports suggesting that presidential elections were being planned for July 2025. Sources within the president's office and the Ukrainian government told BBC News Ukraine that no meetings had been held nor instructions given to prepare for elections, labeling the reports as 'fake or manipulative information.' President Zelensky has repeatedly stated that the question of holding elections can only be considered after the conflict is resolved.\n\nFormer President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced on February 16, 2025, that the next presidential elections will take place on October 26, 2025. He claimed his information came from multiple sources, including the Office of the President, law enforcement agencies, the Central Election Commission, and a printing plant which, he alleged, was already calculating the number of ballots required. This followed earlier reports in March 2025 from The Economist, which, citing anonymous sources in the Ukrainian government, had suggested President Zelensky was planning to announce a surprise election for July 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Martial law remains in force through July 1 and no law is changed to permit scheduling under martial law; the Verkhovna Rada does not pass a resolution setting a presidential election date before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The government terminates martial law early (before July 1) and the Verkhovna Rada promptly adopts a resolution setting a specific election date (e.g., in the fall of 2025); or Parliament amends the law to allow scheduling while martial law is in force and then officially sets the date.",
    "rationale": "- Legal constraints: Article 19 of the Law on Martial Law forbids scheduling or holding national elections during martial law. On May 15, 2025, martial law was extended to at least August 6, 2025. By default, this blocks any lawful announcement of a specific presidential election date before July 1. Additionally, election law practice requires setting the date at least 90 days in advance once martial law is lifted, reinforcing that any near-term announcement would either require early termination or legal changes.\n- Political signals: The President’s office publicly denied reports of planning a July 2025 election and said elections can be considered only after the conflict is resolved. This aligns with the legal status quo. Although The Economist (March) and Petro Poroshenko (Feb 16) floated timelines (including July and October 26), neither is an official act by an authorized body, and the government has pushed back on such reports.\n- Status quo bias: Governments rarely reverse fresh decisions quickly; the Rada just extended martial law to Aug 6. Early termination within ~6 weeks would likely require a material change in the security situation or a clear political decision to prioritize scheduling. Both look unlikely given the government’s stated stance.\nWhy not higher: A lawful announcement requires either (1) early termination of martial law before July 1 or (2) rapid legal changes allowing scheduling under martial law—both are improbable given recent extension and official denials.\nWhy not lower: A small chance remains that authorities act unexpectedly—e.g., if security conditions improve abruptly, external pressure mounts, or leadership opts to set a fall date by first lifting martial law in late June.\nWhat would move me up: Concrete steps to end martial law before July 1 (presidential decree submitted to the Rada), a fast-tracked bill to permit scheduling during martial law, or credible, on-record statements from the Verkhovna Rada leadership or the Central Election Commission indicating imminent scheduling.\nWhat would move me down: Further public rejections from top officials, signs of deteriorating security, or another extension signal that eliminates any realistic window before July 1.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nUnder Ukrainian law, specifically Article 19 of the Law “On the Legal Regime of Martial Law,” scheduling or holding national elections is forbidden while martial law is in effect.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
