    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 67 days (from April 25, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Harvard retains its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The IRS follows standard procedures which take several months to years, or Harvard successfully obtains preliminary injunctions blocking any revocation attempt, or the Trump administration's threat remains rhetorical without formal IRS action being completed before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The IRS expedites revocation proceedings under political pressure, issues an emergency determination revoking Harvard's 501(c)(3) status, and any legal challenges by Harvard fail to secure stays or injunctions that would delay implementation until after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily weights the status quo outcome for several critical reasons. First, the timeline is extraordinarily compressed - only 67 days for a complete revocation process that typically takes months or years. Second, IRS revocation of 501(c)(3) status requires substantial procedural steps including investigation, notice, opportunity to respond, and appeals processes, even under expedited circumstances. Third, the base rate for major universities losing tax-exempt status is essentially zero in modern history. Fourth, Harvard has enormous legal resources and would almost certainly immediately file for injunctions and temporary restraining orders that would delay any action. Fifth, even politically motivated IRS actions face judicial review and procedural requirements that cannot easily be circumvented. The research assistant provided no additional information suggesting concrete steps have been taken beyond threats. However, I'm not forecasting 1-2% because: (1) this involves direct presidential pressure creating unusual circumstances, (2) the Trump administration has shown willingness to take aggressive administrative actions, and (3) there's a non-zero chance of emergency administrative procedures I'm not aware of. I would update significantly higher (to 15-25%) if credible reporting showed the IRS had formally begun revocation proceedings with an expedited timeline, or if legal experts indicated such rapid action was procedurally possible. I would update lower (to 1-2%) if reports emerged of Harvard filing successful preliminary injunctions or IRS statements indicating standard multi-month procedures would apply.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University lose its tax exempt status before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Trump Threatens Harvard’s Tax Status, Escalating Billion-Dollar Pressure Campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-status.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, at any time before July 1, 2025, Harvard loses its [501(c)(3) status](https://oc.finance.harvard.edu/faq/harvard-university-tax-exempt-organization).\n\nIf there is no credible reporting that Harvard has lost its 501(c)(3) status with the Internal Revenue Service before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
