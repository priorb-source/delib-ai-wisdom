    "review": "Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 present dramatically different interpretations, and both raise critical new information I hadn't fully considered.\n\nForecaster 2's March 2025 goods export data (6.8% YoY growth) initially seems supportive, but there's a crucial timing issue that Forecaster 3 highlights: tariffs were implemented on April 2, 2025. This means April exports operated under the new tariff regime for 28-29 of 30 days, while March exports largely occurred pre-tariff.\n\nForecaster 3's evidence of a 45% drop in China-US shipping bookings is devastating if these represent actual April shipments. However, I need clarification on whether 'bookings' are forward-looking (affecting May/June) or reflect April activity. The manufacturing PMI contraction and retaliatory measures are also significant headwinds.\n\nMy original analysis overweighted February data without adequately considering the April 2 tariff implementation date. Forecaster 2's March estimate of ~$260-270 billion (if goods are 65-70% of total) suggests exports were already near or potentially below the $262.578 billion threshold BEFORE the April tariffs hit.\n\nThe key question: Can April 2025 exceed $262.578 billion when operating almost entirely under tariffs that triggered a 45% shipping booking drop with a major trading partner? This seems highly unlikely.\n\nHowever, I don't fully agree with Forecaster 3's 8% because: (1) March goods growth of 6.8% YoY shows some underlying resilience, (2) the exact timing and measurement of the 45% shipping drop needs verification, (3) services exports may provide a buffer, (4) some contractual commitments may have been fulfilled regardless.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm significantly revising my forecast downward. The April 2, 2025 tariff implementation date is the critical fact I underweighted. Operating under the new tariff regime for essentially the entire month, combined with documented trade disruptions (45% shipping booking decline, retaliatory measures, manufacturing contraction), makes year-over-year growth extremely difficult.\n\nMarch 2025 data showing goods exports implying total exports near $260-270 billion means we were already at or potentially below the threshold before April's tariffs. For April to exceed $262.578 billion would require either maintaining March levels (unlikely given tariff headwinds) or growing from a potentially weak base.\n\nI'm not going as low as 8% because: the March goods YoY growth of 6.8% suggests not all trade collapsed, services may be more resilient, and there's measurement uncertainty about when tariff effects fully materialized. But I'm moving substantially lower from my original 65%.",
