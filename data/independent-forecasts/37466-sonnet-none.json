    "status_quo_outcome": "No - WorldAtlas.com continues to display 'Gulf of Mexico' on their North America page",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com maintains standard international geographic naming conventions and does not update their North America map page to reflect the U.S. government's unilateral name change. The website continues using 'Gulf of Mexico' as this remains the internationally recognized name used by most geographic authorities and organizations worldwide.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas.com updates their North America page to acknowledge the U.S. government's executive order renaming the body of water. They either replace 'Gulf of Mexico' with 'Gulf of America' or use both names (e.g., 'Gulf of America (formerly Gulf of Mexico)'), possibly to align with U.S. government usage or to reflect current political developments affecting their primarily U.S. audience.",
    "rationale": "This question relates to the recent executive order changing U.S. government naming of the Gulf of Mexico. With 54 days remaining, the key factors are: (1) The article URL already includes '(Gulf of America)' in the title, suggesting WorldAtlas is aware of and possibly preparing for the name change. This is significant evidence against pure status quo. (2) WorldAtlas.com is a U.S.-based commercial website that may be responsive to U.S. government changes, unlike international geographic authorities. (3) However, most authoritative international bodies (UN, National Geographic, IHO) continue using 'Gulf of Mexico' and changing established geographic names requires broad consensus. (4) Private websites have no legal obligation to follow executive orders about naming. (5) The short timeframe makes major changes less likely unless already planned. The evidence of '(Gulf of America)' already appearing in their article title is the strongest signal they might update. However, updating a major continental map page is more significant than an article title. Status quo bias suggests most geographic features retain their names, but the existing acknowledgment of the alternative name suggests a non-trivial probability of change. My forecast would be higher (60%+) if we had evidence of planned updates or if WorldAtlas had already changed other pages. It would be lower (10-20%) without the parenthetical reference already existing. I would update higher if: WorldAtlas announces planned changes, other similar websites adopt the new name, or their other pages start showing the change. I would update lower if: they issue a statement maintaining 'Gulf of Mexico', international geographic bodies explicitly reject the name change, or we pass mid-June without changes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
