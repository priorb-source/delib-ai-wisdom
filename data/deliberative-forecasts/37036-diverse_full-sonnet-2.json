    "review": "Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 both provide thoughtful analyses that largely align with my reasoning but reach slightly different conclusions (40% and 30% respectively, compared to my 25%). All three of us agree on the core evidence: Osborn's exploratory committee formed in early April, typical exploratory phases last 3-6 months, his 2024 announcement was in July, and he stated he'll decide by 'early summer.' The main area of disagreement is how to weight strategic acceleration factors versus historical precedent and timeline norms. Forecaster 2's case for 40% emphasizes fundraising urgency given Ricketts' wealth and Trump's endorsement, arguing strategic necessity could override conventional timelines. This is a valid point I underweighted. However, I find Forecaster 3's counterarguments compelling: as an independent with no filing deadlines, Osborn faces less structural pressure, and after a 2024 loss, he may need more time to assess viability. Forecaster 3's 30% forecast aligns closely with my thinking. The key uncertainty remains the interpretation of 'early summer' - while this could colloquially mean late May, it more naturally suggests June or later, especially given that summer officially begins June 20-21. Neither forecaster presented evidence that fundamentally changes my assessment, though the fundraising pressure argument deserves more weight than I initially gave it.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast modestly upward from 25% to 28%. The fundraising and strategic pressure arguments raised by Forecaster 2 have merit - Trump's April 11 endorsement of Ricketts and the advantages of beginning Q2 fundraising as a declared campaign could accelerate Osborn's timeline. Additionally, his existing name recognition and infrastructure from the 2024 race could reduce the typical exploratory phase. However, I remain on the lower end of the range because the preponderance of evidence still points to a post-June 1 announcement. With only 38 days until the deadline and just three weeks since forming his exploratory committee, an announcement before June 1 would represent an unusually compressed timeline. His statement about deciding by 'early summer' most naturally refers to June or later. His July 2023 announcement for the 2024 race suggests similar timing for 2026. Most importantly, as an independent with no primary filing deadlines, he lacks the structural pressure that might force an early announcement. The consensus forming around 25-40% seems appropriate, with my updated 28% reflecting modest upward adjustment for strategic acceleration possibilities while maintaining that the base case remains a June/July announcement.",
