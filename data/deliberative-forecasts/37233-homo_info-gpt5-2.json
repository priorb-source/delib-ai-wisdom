    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a useful datapoint I hadn’t cited: Ouattara’s January remarks to the diplomatic corps signaling good health but no decision and pointing to other RHDP options. That supports intentional delay and lowers the odds of a May declaration. Both F2 and F3 emphasize the lack of a scheduled May RHDP congress or deadline pressure, aligning with my base-case “wait” view. Forecaster 3’s point that the opposition looks weakened (e.g., reported late-April ruling affecting Tidjane Thiam) would further reduce any urgency to declare; I treat that specific claim cautiously since it wasn’t in the assistant’s brief, but the strategic logic is sound. Overall, their reasoning is coherent and slightly more conservative than mine, nudging me down modestly.",
    "rationale": "Key drivers remain: declarations in the region often come closer to filing deadlines; in 2020 Ouattara declared late; there’s no known May party conclave compelling an announcement; and third-party ministerial statements don’t resolve the question—only his own declaration does. The added January signal of deliberate timing and the absence of visible May triggers increase the weight on the status quo (no declaration by June 1). Conversely, strong intra-party signaling in late 2024/early 2025 keeps open the possibility of a sudden May rally or National Council meeting to lock in his candidacy. On balance, I’m lowering my forecast by 5 points (from 35% to 30%) to reflect the additional emphasis on deliberate delay and lack of a May forcing mechanism, while still reserving nontrivial probability for a quick, coordinated May announcement if RHDP chooses to preempt internal jockeying.",
