    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 10–14 days (polling day 1 May 2025; results expected 2–3 May)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the Conservatives currently hold the most seats on West Northamptonshire Council after winning a large majority in 2021.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A strong anti-Conservative swing focused in Northampton town lets Labour sweep most urban three-member wards, while Lib Dems and Greens take chunks of rural vote and a few seats, pushing the Conservatives below Labour as largest group.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives lose ground but retain enough rural three-member wards in Daventry and South Northants to remain the largest party, even if the council moves to No Overall Control.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: In 2021, the Conservatives won a large majority on the newly created West Northamptonshire Council (roughly two-thirds of the 93 seats). Geography favors them: rural wards in Daventry and South Northants tend to vote Conservative, and multi-member FPTP often delivers sweeps where a party leads comfortably. Status quo therefore points to Conservatives remaining the largest group. Headwinds: National polling as of April 2025 shows a large Labour lead, and local elections typically punish the party in national government. Northampton town is more favourable to Labour and could deliver many seats if the swing is strong, while Lib Dems/Greens can erode Conservative dominance in some rural wards. The 2018 county financial collapse and subsequent reorganization could still create anti-Conservative sentiment locally. Why not higher: The national environment is poor for Conservatives; a concentrated swing in urban wards plus opposition gains in select rural wards could make Labour the largest party. Why not lower: The Conservatives start from a very high seat base and enjoy structural advantages in rural areas; even a large vote swing may still leave them with the most seats, though likely short of a majority. What would move me up: Evidence of weak Labour/Lib Dem/Green candidate coverage; signs of Conservative resilience in ward-level canvass data; credible local polling showing Conservatives competitive in Northampton town; fragmented opposition contests. What would move me down: Credible ward-level polling or by-election-style results showing large urban swings and notable rural inroads by Lib Dems/Greens; reports of coordinated opposition targeting or pacts; major local Conservative scandals; indications of high anti-Conservative turnout in Northampton. Research assistant provided no additional info, so this forecast leans on 2021 results, geography, and national polling context, with extra weight on the status quo.",
