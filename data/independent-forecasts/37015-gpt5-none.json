    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 13 days (until end of May 4, 2025, local time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han, serving as acting president, prioritizes neutrality and stability, publicly declines or simply refrains from declaring. PPP coalesces around an alternative nominee, or legal/ethical norms against an acting president running deter a bid. No explicit candidacy announcement is made before May 5.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "PPP leadership formally drafts Han for the June snap presidential election; he accepts and makes a clear public announcement of candidacy before May 5 to meet compressed campaign timelines.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and time constraint: With only ~13 days left and no announcement yet, the status quo favors No. Announcements typically precede a June election by weeks, but the remaining window is still narrow.\n- Acting president precedent: In 2017, Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn declined to run in the snap election, citing the need for neutrality and governance continuity. This norm weighs against Han declaring while acting as head of state, even if not legally barred.\n- Candidate profile: Han Duck-soo is a senior technocratic figure rather than a campaign-oriented politician, which reduces the likelihood he personally opts into a hurried national race.\n- Countervailing pressure: The cited report indicates growing PPP interest in drafting Han for a June election. If PPP lacks a consensus alternative and wants a stability figure, party pressure could push an early declaration; if he runs at all, the compressed calendar makes a pre–May 5 announcement likely.\n- Net assessment: Weighing the strong status quo/precedent against the reported party draft effort and the urgency of a June election, a modest chance that he announces within the next two weeks seems warranted but still clearly below even odds.\n- Research assistant note: No additional information was available beyond the background reference.\n- Why not higher: Strong norms against an acting president campaigning, Han’s technocratic profile, and the very short window.\n- Why not lower: The report of active drafting efforts and the necessity for rapid decisions in a snap election create a real, time-compressed path to a quick announcement.\n- What would move the forecast up: Credible reports of Han forming a campaign team, meeting donors, or PPP leadership publicly uniting behind him with a timeline; legal/administrative steps enabling his timely resignation (if required) and succession plans.\n- What would move it down: A public statement by Han ruling out a run, PPP selecting another nominee, or legal/ethical guidance discouraging or barring an acting president’s candidacy this cycle.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Han Duck-soo announce his candidacy for South Korean president before May 5, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Chosun Daily: [Support grows in PPP to draft Acting President Han for June election](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464554)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Han Duck-soo announces his candidacy for president of South Korea before May 5, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
