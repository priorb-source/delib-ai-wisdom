    "review": "Both forecasters provided critical data I lacked in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's specific historical June data is particularly valuable: 1106 (2020), 434 (2021), 340 (2022), and 267 (2023) shows a clear downward trend, with the most recent June at only 267 reports - well below the 400 threshold. This contradicts my initial assumption that recent baseline reporting might have increased. The finding that all months in 2023-early 2024 stayed below 350 is strong evidence against exceeding 400. Forecaster 3's analysis of potential catalysts (Starlink, solar maximum, seasonal factors) is reasonable but speculative. Both forecasters converge on 30-33% probability, which I find more empirically grounded than my initial 55%. The key insight is that 400+ would require approximately a 50% increase over June 2023, representing a reversal of the established downward trend without a clear catalyst.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly lowering my forecast from 55% to 35% based on the concrete historical data provided by Forecaster 2. The evidence is compelling: June 2023 had only 267 reports, and there's a consistent downward trend since the 2020 COVID-era outlier. No month in 2023-2024 exceeded 350 reports. To exceed 400 would require a substantial reversal of this trend. However, I maintain slightly higher probability than the other forecasters (30-33%) because: (1) we still have time before June where unexpected events could occur, (2) Forecaster 3's points about Starlink launches and solar maximum provide plausible spike mechanisms, (3) historical data shows volatility is possible - June exceeded 400 in three of the five years from 2017-2021, and (4) a single viral event or media cycle could temporarily boost reporting. The status quo strongly suggests continuation below 400, but the tail risk of an anomalous spike warrants keeping the probability above 30%.",
