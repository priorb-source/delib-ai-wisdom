    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly in the 79-85% range, which increases my confidence that we're converging on a reasonable estimate. Forecaster 2 introduced important historical data I hadn't explicitly referenced: Stapleton's 17 prior ACM wins. This is compelling evidence of both his industry standing and his proven ability to convert nominations into wins, not just receive nominations. This strengthens the case for a Yes outcome. Forecaster 3 provided valuable counterbalancing points, specifically naming current competitors (Lainey Wilson, Luke Combs, Morgan Wallen, Jelly Roll) and emphasizing vote-splitting dynamics and category correlations. This latter point is important - the five nominations aren't truly independent events if there's a broader voting mood either favoring or disfavoring Stapleton across categories. If voters decide to reward other artists this cycle, the effective probability of winning at least one could be lower than simple independent probability calculations suggest. Both forecasters used similar probabilistic frameworks to mine, which validates the analytical approach. The main tension is between the strong historical track record (17 wins) pulling the forecast higher, and the competitive field plus vote-correlation concerns pulling it lower.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating slightly upward based primarily on the weight of Stapleton's 17 prior ACM wins, which I hadn't explicitly incorporated into my initial forecast. This track record is strong evidence that he doesn't just get nominated but actually wins at a high rate when nominated. However, I'm tempering this update because Forecaster 3's point about category correlations and vote-splitting is valid and suggests my initial independence assumption may have been too optimistic. If there's a voting mood shift toward other artists this year, multiple nominations provide less redundancy than pure probability would suggest. The named competitors represent a genuinely strong current field in country music. My updated forecast of 83% reflects a modest increase from 82%, acknowledging Stapleton's proven conversion rate while maintaining appropriate uncertainty about competitive dynamics and correlated voting patterns. The tight clustering of all three forecasts (79-85%) also increases my confidence that this range is appropriate.",
