    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a concrete (though unverified) data point: April 2025 at ~$0.632 and notes frequent recent crossings of the $0.630 line. If accurate, that materially increases the plausibility of a sub-$0.630 May print because only a modest downtick is needed. Their balance of near-threshold positioning vs. modest upward pressures is reasonable; however, 45% feels a bit high given the strict “under $0.6300” criterion and slight upward tilt recently. Forecaster 3 overstates the reduction in uncertainty from timing—mid-May means some data still to be realized—and leans on general stability rather than threshold-specific dynamics. The argument that we’d have heard about a spike is less relevant to the question (we only need a small downtick to get under). I find F2’s specific threshold-proximity reasoning more persuasive than F3’s broader narrative, but I still weigh upward cost pressures and the strict cutoff.",
    "rationale": "My prior was 28% for a Yes outcome (under $0.6300). The new element is F2’s claim that April is ~$0.632 and that the series has recently straddled $0.630. If April truly printed ~$0.632, a typical month-to-month move of 0.1–2.0 cents would make a sub-$0.630 outcome plausible. However, the strict requirement to be below $0.6300 (0.6300 resolves No) plus cited upward pressures (wholesaler price hikes, port fees) still bias odds toward a No. I discount F3’s timing argument and their reliance on the absence of “spike” news, since only a small move is needed and spikes aren’t the issue. Net effect: I move up modestly from 28% to reflect proximity to the threshold and the reported April level, but remain below 50% given slight upward drift and the strict cutoff.",
