    "review": "The other forecasters present significantly different information landscapes. Forecaster 2 claims specific details about massive protests since March 19, including hundreds of thousands of participants and nearly 1,900 detentions - none of which appear in my research assistant's report. Forecaster 3 describes May 1 events with 65,000 authorized marchers and 384 detentions, which is much more detailed than my report's mention of 'arrests made ahead of May 1st protests.' \n\nThis creates a critical epistemological problem: Are they working from additional sources, making reasonable inferences from the Wikipedia article, or overinterpreting limited information? My research assistant's report only mentions the Saraçhane protests (14 arrests) and preemptive May 1st actions. If protests with hundreds of thousands of participants actually occurred in March as F2 claims, this would be the dominant fact, not a minor detail about 14 arrests. \n\nF2's 78% reflects high confidence that large protests have already occurred and will be documented. F3's 55% reflects uncertainty about whether May 1 events meet the tracker's criteria. Both are substantially higher than my 23%, suggesting I may be underweighting the Wikipedia article as a signal or missing reasonable inferences from available information.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm maintaining relative skepticism about claims I cannot verify from my source material. However, I acknowledge three important considerations raised by the other forecasters:\n\n1. The Wikipedia article titled '2025 Turkish protests' is a stronger signal than I initially weighted - it suggests notable, documented protest activity worthy of encyclopedic coverage.\n\n2. The May 1st mention in my report ('arrests made ahead of May 1st protests') may indicate larger events than I assumed. Labor Day historically involves significant demonstrations in Turkey.\n\n3. My initial 23% may have been too anchored on government suppression capacity without adequately accounting for the possibility that large protests have already occurred or are more likely than baseline.\n\nHowever, I cannot responsibly increase my forecast to 55-78% based on specific claims (March protests with hundreds of thousands, 65,000 May 1 marchers) that don't appear in my source material. If such events occurred, the resolution is likely Yes, but I lack confirmation.\n\nI'm updating modestly upward to 35% to reflect: (1) the Wikipedia article as stronger evidence of significant protest activity, (2) acknowledgment that May 1 and Saraçhane may be part of larger dynamics, and (3) deference to other forecasters' confidence suggesting I may be missing something. But I'm not moving to their levels without verifiable evidence of the specific large-scale protests they describe.",
