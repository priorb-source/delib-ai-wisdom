  "information": "The IMF has conditioned an agreement on the implementation of several key reforms. While Lebanon has completed some prior actions, including passing amendments to the bank-secrecy law and establishing an electricity-tariff framework, significant obstacles remain. The passage of a bank-restructuring law and measures to control the cash economy are described as unresolved and politically contentious issues. The IMF has publicly characterized the progress in talks as 'slow' and has expressed specific concerns about provisions in the proposed banking reform law, including the composition of a 'Higher Banking Authority' and the scope of its powers.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement announced or signed that commits IMF money to Lebanon before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Lebanon fails to pass an IMF-compliant bank restructuring law and other prior actions (capital controls, cash-economy measures). IMF statements continue to describe progress as slow; no staff-level agreement with financing terms or Board meeting appears on the IMF calendar in June. Political paralysis and border tensions persist, delaying decisions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid breakthrough: Parliament passes an IMF-compliant bank-restructuring law and related measures; the authorities and IMF reach and announce a staff-level agreement that includes specific access amounts, with letters (LOI/MEFP) signed, or the IMF Executive Board approves an arrangement (e.g., EFF or RFI) and it’s announced in June with signed documents committing funds.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The IMF has conditioned financing on key reforms. According to the research assistant, while Lebanon has made some prior steps (bank-secrecy amendments, electricity-tariff framework), major sticking points remain: a credible bank-restructuring law, capital controls/cash economy measures, and governance design (e.g., the proposed Higher Banking Authority). The IMF characterizes progress as slow and has specific concerns with the draft banking law. With roughly one month left, legislative and political hurdles are substantial, and IMF processes (staff-level agreement, LOI/MEFP finalization, and/or Board scheduling) typically take weeks once prior actions are met. These factors make the status quo outcome a No. Why not higher: Short timeline; unresolved, politically contentious reforms; IMF’s cautious stance with Lebanon; requirement that the agreement include IMF money (SMP/PMB would not count). Why not lower: Tail paths exist—heightened regional risk could spur a stop-gap facility (e.g., RFI) with lighter prior actions, or a narrowly tailored staff-level agreement with explicit access could be announced if key laws pass quickly. What would move me up: - Credible reports that Parliament passes an IMF-compliant bank-restructuring law aligned with IMF feedback (including governance fixes). - Government enacts capital controls/cash-economy measures the IMF has requested. - IMF statements indicating imminent staff-level agreement with specified access or an IMF Board date set in June for Lebanon. - Publication/signing of LOI/MEFP. What would move me down: - Public IMF statements that reforms remain insufficient or that talks are stalled. - Escalation of political paralysis or security tensions that delay Parliament. - No signs of Board scheduling or staff-level progress by mid-June. Summary of assistant info affecting forecast: Key reforms incomplete; IMF says progress is slow; concerns over the bank-restructuring framework’s governance; some prior actions done but the most contentious items remain. Given the short window and persistent obstacles, a Yes is possible but unlikely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the IMF and Lebanon announce an agreement before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lebanon finance minister confident of a new deal with IMF to help crumbling economy](https://www.newarab.com/news/lebanon-finance-minister-confident-new-deal-imf)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Lebanon and the International Monetary Fund announce any economic agreement between the two entities signed after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025. In order to count, it must involve the IMF agreeing to provide money to Lebanon, whether through loans, grants, or any other means.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe IMF has conditioned an agreement on the implementation of several key reforms.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
