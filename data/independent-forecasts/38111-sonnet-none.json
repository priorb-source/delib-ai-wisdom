    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "31 days (the entire month of June 2025, from tomorrow June 1 through June 30)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no country announces recognition during June 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the UK and France initiative announced in May, the diplomatic process moves slowly. Both countries continue internal deliberations and coordination efforts, but no formal announcement of recognition occurs during the specific 30-day window of June 2025. Any recognition announcements are delayed until July or later months to allow for proper coordination and domestic political considerations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Building on the momentum from the May 20 UK-France initiative, one or both countries formally announce recognition of Palestine in June 2025. Alternatively, another UN member country inspired by this initiative or acting independently makes a formal recognition announcement during June. This could be part of a coordinated diplomatic effort or an individual country moving ahead on its own timeline.",
    "rationale": "The May 20, 2025 announcement that the UK joined France's initiative for Palestinian recognition is significant and provides recent momentum just 11 days before the evaluation period. However, several factors moderate the probability. First, the question asks about a very narrow 30-day window. Diplomatic recognition is a major foreign policy decision requiring internal government processes, parliamentary considerations, and often international coordination. The article describes an 'initiative' rather than an imminent announcement, suggesting a planning phase rather than immediate action. Historically, recognition announcements often occur during major summits or as coordinated diplomatic events, which require time to organize. The research assistant provided no additional information suggesting imminent specific plans for June. While the UK-France momentum is real and increases the probability above baseline, the narrow time window and typical pace of diplomatic processes suggest it's more likely that recognitions occur in subsequent months rather than this specific June window. My forecast is not higher because: (1) only 11 days elapsed between the initiative announcement and June, which is quite rapid for such decisions; (2) no specific June timeline has been reported; (3) coordinated announcements (which seem likely given the 'initiative' framing) take time to arrange. My forecast is not lower because: (1) there is genuine recent momentum; (2) major countries are involved; (3) it's possible one country moves independently on a faster timeline; (4) 30 days is enough time for a prepared announcement. I would update higher with reports of specific June announcement dates or government statements indicating imminent action, and lower if early June passes without movement or officials indicate longer timelines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a UN member country newly recognize Palestine in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[UK joins France's initiative for recognition of Palestinian state](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/05/20/uk-joins-france-s-initiative-for-recognition-of-palestinian-state_6741456_4.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, a UN member country announces that it recognizes Palestine as a sovereign nation. Resolves based on Al Jazeera's [tracking page](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/10/mapping-which-countries-recognise-palestine-in-2025) or other credible sources should the tracking page not be timely updated.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
