  "information": "A survey by the Imperial Data Bank found that for 2025, only 19.2% of companies in the Tohoku region expect an increase in revenue and profits, a three-year low, while 26.2% expect a decrease, citing fluctuating oil prices, inflation, and labor shortages. In April 2025, corporate bankruptcies in the region rose to 53, a 32.5% increase from the same month last year and the third consecutive month of increases. Additionally, new company establishments in the region decreased by 5% in 2024, the first annual decrease in two years.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2.5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "A slight month-over-month decrease or stagnation in industrial production, representing a reversion to the mean after an unusually strong March.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The economic headwinds identified in the region—such as rising bankruptcies and weak business confidence—translate into reduced orders and output. The large 7.6% increase in March creates a high statistical base, making a further increase difficult and resulting in a slight contraction or flat reading for April.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The strong momentum from the March rebound continues, driven by a sustained recovery in key manufacturing sectors like automotive or electronics. This sector-specific strength is enough to overcome the broader negative economic sentiment and produce a second consecutive month of growth.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards a slight contraction in April's industrial production. The primary driver for this assessment is the significant negative economic data for the Tohoku region. The research indicates that only 19.2% of companies expect growth in 2025, corporate bankruptcies rose 32.5% year-over-year in April, and new company establishments are declining. These are strong leading indicators of economic weakness that typically correlate with reduced industrial output. While the 7.6% production increase in March is a notable positive signal, such large monthly jumps are often followed by a period of consolidation or a slight pullback, a phenomenon known as reversion to the mean. The March data set a high baseline, making a consecutive increase less probable under the current challenging economic conditions.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 42% because the March figure was genuinely strong, indicating that some sectors may have powerful momentum that could have persisted into April. Industrial production data is inherently volatile, and back-to-back months of growth are not unprecedented, especially during a recovery from a slump (March was the 'first increase in three months').\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 42% because the wealth of negative forward-looking indicators and hard data on business health (bankruptcies, low profit expectations) outweighs the signal from a single month of production data. To forecast growth (>50%) would be to ignore the clear signs of distress in the regional economy.\n\nI would increase my probability if there were positive national-level industrial production data or specific news of major new orders in key Tohoku industries. Conversely, I would decrease it if regional energy prices spiked or major manufacturers in Tohoku announced production cuts.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Northeast Japan region (Tohoku) show a month-over-month increase in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tohoku's March industrial production index rises 7.6% from the previous month, the first increase in three months](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCC214DI0R20C25A5000000/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [industrial production announcement](https://www.tohoku.meti.go.jp/cyosa/tokei/iip.html) for April 2025 (expected approximately June 21, 2025) reports a monthly change in production (\"生産\") of greater than 0.0%.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA survey by the Imperial Data Bank found that for 2025, only 19.2% of companies in the Tohoku region expect an increase in revenue and profits, a three-year low, while 26.2% expect a decrease, citing fluctuating oil prices, inflation, and labor shortages.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
