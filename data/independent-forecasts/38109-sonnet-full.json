  "information": "Kalshi, a prediction market platform regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has been actively offering daily MLB markets since April 17, 2025. Sports-related contracts represent a significant portion of its business, accounting for over 80% of weekend trading volume. The company has handled substantial trading activity, including $27 million for the Super Bowl and $500 million for the March Madness basketball tournament. Kalshi has also filed with the CFTC to expand its offerings to include single-game predictions.\n\nThe platform faces legal and regulatory challenges. A judge in Nevada is expected to rule quickly on a case involving Kalshi's prediction markets. Major sports leagues have voiced concerns; the NBA has cited 'substantial integrity risks' due to a perceived lack of regulatory oversight compared to traditional sportsbooks, and Major League Baseball has highlighted the need for consumer protections equivalent to state-level regulations. In response, Kalshi has announced plans to enhance user protections, including voluntary opt-outs, self-imposed trading breaks, and deposit caps.\n\nJune is part of the MLB regular season, during which games are scheduled on nearly every calendar day. The MLB All-Star Game is scheduled for July 2025. Other baseball-related events in late June include the Liga Mexicana de Béisbol (LMB) All-Star Game, set to take place from June 27 to 29, 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 30 days until June 30, 2025 ends and the outcome is fully determined",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Kalshi continues offering daily MLB markets throughout June as they have been since April 17, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A No outcome could occur if legal/regulatory action forces Kalshi to suspend sports betting markets during June, if MLB or CFTC intervention halts operations, if technical issues prevent market offerings on any single day, or if there's a day in June without any MLB games scheduled and thus no markets to offer",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi maintains its current daily operations throughout June 2025, continuing to offer markets on at least one MLB game each day as it has been doing since mid-April, with no legal, regulatory, or operational interruptions during the month",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. Kalshi has been consistently offering daily MLB markets since April 17, 2025 - over six weeks of established operations. June falls squarely within MLB's regular season when games occur virtually every day, providing ample opportunity for market offerings. The financial incentives are compelling: sports contracts represent over 80% of weekend trading volume, with major events generating $27M (Super Bowl) and $500M (March Madness) in trading activity.\n\nHowever, several risks warrant caution. The Nevada legal case with a judge planning to rule 'quickly' creates regulatory uncertainty, though 'quickly' in legal terms may still allow operations to continue through June. MLB has raised integrity concerns and called for enhanced consumer protections, though Kalshi's announced protective measures (voluntary opt-outs, trading breaks, deposit caps) suggest proactive risk management. The requirement for markets 'every day' means even a single day's failure results in No - whether from legal action, technical issues, or operational decisions.\n\nThe strongest evidence supporting my forecast is the established pattern of daily offerings over six weeks, strong business incentives, and reliable game scheduling during the regular season. My forecast isn't higher because the 'every day' requirement is stringent and legal/regulatory risks, while uncertain in probability and timing, could materially impact operations. It isn't lower because the status quo is demonstrably strong, June is prime baseball season, and any legal intervention would likely take time to implement even after a ruling.\n\nI would update higher if: legal challenges are dismissed or delayed beyond June, Kalshi announces long-term commitments to MLB markets, or we observe continued stable operations through early June. I would update lower if: the Nevada ruling comes quickly and unfavorably, CFTC signals intervention, MLB escalates pressure, or we observe any operational disruptions in late May/early June.",
