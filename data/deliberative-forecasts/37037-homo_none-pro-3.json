    "review": "The deliberation process has been extremely valuable, revealing a critical flaw in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's contribution was pivotal. Their core argument—that a direct check of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) shows no active 50% tariff on Lesotho—completely refutes the premise I (and Forecaster 3) had based our forecasts on. My initial assumption, drawn from the background article, was that the tariff existed and bureaucratic inertia would keep it in place. Forecaster 2's evidence-based approach, relying on the primary source for resolution, is far more compelling than my assumption. Forecaster 3's reasoning about inertia is sound in theory, but they seem to have applied it to the same incorrect factual premise as I did. If the tariff does not currently exist, inertia actually supports the 'No' outcome, not the 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 95% was based entirely on the assumption that the 50% tariff described in the 2020 AP article was still listed in the HTS. Forecaster 2's analysis prompted me to verify this claim against the official HTS data, the explicit source for resolution. My verification confirmed Forecaster 2's finding: there is no HTS subheading that I can locate which applies a '+ 50%' duty to Lesotho. For the specific item mentioned in the article (a category of furskins), Lesotho, as a beneficiary of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), is eligible for duty-free treatment. The status quo is therefore a 'No' outcome. For the question to resolve as 'Yes', the US government would have to actively introduce a new 50% tariff on Lesotho and have it reflected in the HTS by June 1, 2025. Given the short time frame and the complete absence of any political or economic motivation for such a specific and punitive action, the probability of this happening is exceedingly low. I am therefore completely reversing my forecast. The small residual probability accounts for the non-zero chance of a major clerical error being published in the HTS or a truly unforeseeable 'black swan' geopolitical event.",
