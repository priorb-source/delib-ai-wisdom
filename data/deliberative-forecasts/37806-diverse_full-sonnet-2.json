    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I underweighted: official language typically uses 'Diversity Immigrant Visa Program' or 'visa lottery' rather than the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' without additional words. This exact-phrase constraint is more restrictive than I initially considered. Additionally, F3's observation that the DV-2026 results release in early May represented a natural timing trigger that has already passed is significant - if no action occurred then, the probability should be lower now. Forecaster 2's points about triggering events (like a crime) and symbolic value are valid but somewhat speculative. The convergence around the 'strong status quo' observation across all three analyses reinforces that 60+ immigration actions without mentioning the program suggests it's not a top priority for executive action versus legislative approaches.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I'm updating downward primarily due to Forecaster 3's compelling argument about the exact phrase requirement. Official documents are more likely to say 'Diversity Immigrant Visa Program' or reference the 'visa lottery' colloquially. Even if Trump issues an action targeting the program, it may not use the precise two-word phrase 'Diversity Visa' needed for resolution. The fact that the DV-2026 results were released in early May without prompting a presidential action is also telling - that natural trigger moment has passed. However, I'm not going as low as 14% because: (1) Trump remains prolific with immigration actions and 42 days is still meaningful time; (2) some actions might use the exact phrase for clarity, especially if referencing the statutory program name; (3) symbolic political motivations or unexpected triggering events remain possible. The status quo pattern is strong but not insurmountable given the administration's demonstrated activism on immigration. Balancing the restrictive exact-phrase requirement against Trump's immigration policy focus and remaining time window, I'm settling on a forecast that reflects meaningful downward revision while maintaining non-trivial probability.",
