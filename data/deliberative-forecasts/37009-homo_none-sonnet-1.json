    "review": "All three forecasters converged on a similar range (15-20%), which suggests we're likely in the right ballpark. The other forecasters raised two particularly important points I hadn't sufficiently emphasized: (1) the complete lack of preparatory signals (staff hiring, fundraising activity, media speculation) that typically precede major campaign announcements, and (2) the explicit principle that good forecasters should heavily weight the status quo. Forecaster 3's observation that the field may be 'stabilizing rather than expanding' after the April 10 dropouts is also insightful - rather than creating a scramble for new entrants, the vacuum may simply persist. These are valid arguments that should marginally decrease my probability.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast down from 20% to 17% based on the stronger emphasis my co-forecasters placed on the absence of preparatory signals. While I initially noted that time had passed without an announcement, I underweighted the significance of having zero reported signals of campaign preparation with only 10 days remaining. Major Senate announcements almost always have advance indicators - fundraising calls, staff movements, media inquiries, or party coordination leaks. The complete absence of such signals this close to the deadline is more telling than I initially credited. However, I'm not going as low as 15% because: (1) unexpected political announcements can occur within 10 days when party pressure intensifies, (2) the Democratic vacuum in this race arguably creates urgency that might compress normal timelines, and (3) Stevens remains a plausible candidate who hasn't definitively ruled out running. The status quo strongly favors No, but 10 days provides enough runway for a scenario where party leaders convince Stevens to enter the race on short notice.",
