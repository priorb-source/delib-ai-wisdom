    "status_quo_outcome": "The current Level 4 advisory remains in place but is not updated or reissued before the deadline, resulting in a 'No' outcome as a new advisory was not 'received'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US State Department's internal schedule for reviewing the Niger travel advisory falls outside the May-June 2025 window. No new major security incidents occur that would trigger an unscheduled update. The current advisory from 2023 remains unchanged on the website, and the question resolves as 'No'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A periodic review of the travel advisory, due since the last major update following the July 2023 coup, occurs before July 1, 2025. Given the ongoing instability, terrorism risks, and political uncertainty, the State Department reissues the advisory, maintaining the 'Level 4 – Do Not Travel' status with updated text. This act of reissuing the advisory satisfies the condition, and the question resolves 'Yes'.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high probability that the US State Department will reissue its Level 4 travel advisory for Niger in the specified timeframe due to procedural norms and the volatile security environment. Niger is already at 'Level 4 – Do Not Travel', a status implemented after the July 2023 military coup. The question, therefore, hinges on whether a new advisory or an official update is issued, not on a change in the country's risk level. The current advisory is well over a year old, making a periodic, scheduled review highly likely. The security situation has not improved; if anything, the withdrawal of US and French forces has created a greater security vacuum, and risks from terrorism and kidnapping persist. This makes a downgrade to a lower level of advisory extremely improbable. Thus, any review will almost certainly result in a reaffirmation of the Level 4 status. The primary uncertainty is the exact timing of this bureaucratic procedure. My forecast is not higher because the roughly two-month window is narrow, and the precise schedule for these reviews is not public; it could fall just outside the resolution period. My forecast is not lower because the combination of a volatile security situation, which could trigger an event-driven update at any moment, and the high likelihood of a scheduled review taking place soon makes an update before July 1 more likely than not. I would raise my probability if a significant security incident occurs in Niger, such as a major attack or kidnapping of a foreigner. I would lower my probability if it were revealed that a comprehensive review had just been completed in April 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Niger receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Niger Faces Growing Travel Risks: U.S. Travel Advisory Highlights Terrorism, Crime, and Limited Medical Care for Tourists in the Country](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/niger-faces-growing-travel-risks-u-s-travel-advisory-highlights-terrorism-crime-and-limited-medical-care-for-tourists-in-the-country/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Niger has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Niger.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
