  "information": "Sean O'Malley is the former bantamweight champion. This fight will be his first since undergoing hip surgery in October 2024 following his loss to Dvalishvili. In preparation for the rematch, O'Malley has been sparring with former UFC middleweight champion Israel Adesanya. O'Malley has stated he is confident in his skills and expects to be significantly better than he was in the first fight post-surgery.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3 months (UFC 316 is expected in late Aug/early Sep 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Fight proceeds as scheduled and Dvalishvili wins a cardio-heavy, wrestling-driven decision over five rounds.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The bout is canceled or the opponent changes (resolves No by rule), or O’Malley keeps it standing long enough to land a clean counter and wins by KO/TKO, or the fight ends in a draw/No Contest.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Dvalishvili reproduces the first meeting: relentless pace, chain wrestling, clinch control, and top pressure leading to a clear decision (48-47/49-46) or late accumulation stoppage.",
    "rationale": "Framing: The question resolves Yes only if Dvalishvili defeats O’Malley at UFC 316; if he doesn’t fight or fights someone else, it resolves No. So the overall probability is roughly P(fight happens as booked) × P(Dvalishvili wins if it happens).\n\nEvidence and weighting:\n- Status quo and matchup: Dvalishvili already beat O’Malley in their first fight. His style—elite cardio, pace, chain wrestling, clinch control—tends to carry well into rematches and five-round fights. Historically, high-output wrestlers with proven durability are consistent, and five rounds accentuate that edge.\n- O’Malley’s paths: He’s a dangerous precision striker with legitimate fight-ending power and excellent timing. Post-hip-surgery mobility could improve his movement and takedown defense recovery, and he’s getting high-level striking looks (e.g., with Israel Adesanya). Still, sparring with a striker doesn’t directly address the specific chain-wrestling and cage-riding sequences that troubled him. His most viable path remains a clean, early-to-mid fight counter that hurts Dvalishvili or creates finishing sequences, or a dramatic improvement in first- and second-layer TDD plus scrambles.\n- Durability/cardio: Dvalishvili has shown exceptional durability and engine across elite opposition; O’Malley has finishing upside but less margin for error in prolonged wrestling exchanges.\n- Event risk: UFC main events several months out carry non-trivial cancellation/rebooking risk (injury, illness, reshuffle). That risk pushes the overall probability down because any such change resolves No.\n\nBack-of-envelope: \n- P(fight happens as booked): ~80–85%.\n- P(Dvalishvili wins if they fight): ~62–70% (favoring the prior result and stylistic edge, allowing meaningful KO/adjustment equity for O’Malley).\nMultiplying midpoints (~0.85 × ~0.67 ≈ 0.57) yields a high-50s overall.\n\nWhy not higher: O’Malley’s KO threat, potential meaningful improvement post-surgery, and the non-trivial chance of cancellation/No Contest/draw keep this from the 60s–70s. Why not lower: The first-fight evidence, five-round dynamics, and Dvalishvili’s proven style/pace advantage point to him as a deserved favorite if they step into the cage.\n\nUpdates I’d watch for:\n- Upward for Dvalishvili: reports/video of O’Malley struggling with wrestling-heavy looks; confirmation of smaller cage; late odds movement toward Dvalishvili; clean bill of health and uneventful camp updates; successful, drama-free weigh-ins.\n- Upward for O’Malley (downward for this forecast): credible evidence of improved layered TDD and cage escapes; sustained wrestling-heavy sparring partners in camp; indications of compromised Dvalishvili cardio/injury; venue factors favoring movement/space; sharp betting moving the line toward O’Malley; any signs of Dvalishvili’s injury/illness or camp disruption.\n\nRA summary used: O’Malley had hip surgery after losing to Dvalishvili, has been sparring with Adesanya, and expects to be much improved. That adds some O’Malley-upside but doesn’t overturn the prior result and stylistic lean toward Dvalishvili.",
