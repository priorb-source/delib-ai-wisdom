    "review": "The two other expert forecasters have arrived at the same 10% probability as my initial forecast, and their reasoning is highly convergent with my own. Both analyses center on the significant inertia of the FATF 'black list', the extremely low probability of removing any of the three current members (North Korea, Iran, Myanmar), and the high political and procedural bar for adding a new member, particularly Russia. Forecaster 3's explicit mention of Russia's status as a G20 and UN Security Council member provides a valuable, concrete reinforcement of the political difficulty of blacklisting them, a point that was implicit in my own analysis. Forecaster 2's use of the 'Last known update' (LNU) principle, referencing the stable outcome of the February 2025 plenary, is also a useful framing device. Overall, their analyses did not introduce new evidence that would cause me to change my forecast, but rather they deepened my confidence in the original reasoning. The strong consensus solidifies the view that a 'No' outcome is highly probable.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 10%. The deliberation process has reinforced my initial assessment without introducing any contradictory evidence. The core of my reasoning remains unchanged: the FATF 'black list' is characterized by a very high degree of inertia, making changes rare and difficult.\n\n1.  **Removals:** There is unanimous agreement that removing North Korea, Iran, or Myanmar is not a credible possibility in the short term. The deep-seated political and structural issues in these jurisdictions prevent the kind of 'significant progress' the FATF would need to see.\n\n2.  **Additions:** The only plausible, albeit low-probability, scenario for a 'Yes' resolution is the addition of a new jurisdiction, with Russia being the sole candidate of note. Our collective analysis confirms that this is highly unlikely. The FATF's decision to maintain Russia's membership suspension for over two years, reaffirmed in February 2025, indicates a stable consensus that stops short of the black list. As the other forecasters noted, the political and economic ramifications of blacklisting a G20 and UNSC permanent member create an extremely high barrier to action, which would likely require a major new geopolitical catalyst to overcome.\n\nThe consensus among all three forecasters on both the final probability and the underlying rationale gives me high confidence in this position. The 10% forecast appropriately reflects the overwhelming likelihood of the status quo while acknowledging the small tail risk of an unexpected geopolitical shock forcing a change in the FATF's posture towards Russia.",
