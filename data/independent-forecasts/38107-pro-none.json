    "status_quo_outcome": "James Comey is not arrested and remains a private citizen.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service investigation into James Comey's social media post concludes without charges, or the inquiry is still ongoing past the resolution date. Mr. Comey is not arrested for any other reason, and the deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without incident.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Prosecutors determine the social media post constitutes a 'true threat' and a decision is made to arrest Mr. Comey before the deadline. Alternatively, a completely unrelated event occurs, such as a traffic stop that escalates or a public altercation, which results in him being taken into custody as defined by the resolution criteria.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored on the strong status quo and the extremely low base rate for the arrest of high-level former officials like an FBI director. An arrest of this nature would be an extraordinary event. The provided context points to a Secret Service inquiry over an ambiguous social media post. While the Secret Service must investigate all potential threats, the post itself (seashells spelling '86 47') is highly unlikely to meet the stringent legal standard of a 'true threat' required for prosecution, as established in cases like *Watts v. United States*. It is more plausibly interpreted as protected, albeit provocative, political speech. Given Mr. Comey's extensive legal background, it is probable he is aware of this distinction. Furthermore, the timeline is very short. To proceed from a preliminary inquiry to a formal arrest of a figure like Comey in just one month would require exceptionally clear and compelling evidence, which does not appear to be the case here. My probability is not zero because the political environment is highly polarized, and there is a non-zero chance that prosecutors might pursue a politically motivated charge, however weak. There is also a small background risk of an arrest due to an unforeseen, mundane incident. My forecast is not higher because the legal bar for the alleged offense is very high, the evidence is ambiguous at best, and the timeline is compressed. I would raise my forecast significantly if credible reports emerged of a grand jury indictment or an official announcement of pending charges. Conversely, I would lower it if the Secret Service officially stated the inquiry was closed with no further action.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
