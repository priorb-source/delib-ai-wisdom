    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 raised a critical piece of information I completely missed: the House has already passed the Tax Reform Bill. This is a major development that fundamentally changes the probability calculation. My initial 30% forecast was based on the bill needing to pass through the entire legislative process in both chambers, but we're actually much further along than I realized. Both forecasters correctly identify that only two steps remain (Senate passage and Presidential assent) with approximately two months left. I find their arguments about executive backing, the July 1 implementation target, and the politically popular nature of the real estate VAT exemption very compelling. However, I'm slightly more concerned than Forecaster 3 about the Q1 target slippage that Forecaster 2 mentioned - this suggests execution risk and potential for further delays. The legislative calendar constraints around Eid al-Adha and the risk of bicameral harmonization if the Senate makes changes are real concerns that could easily push this past July 1, especially given Nigeria's legislative processes can be slow even with executive priority.",
    "rationale": "I need to significantly update my forecast upward based on House passage, which is a major milestone I was unaware of. With one chamber already passed and strong executive backing with an explicit July 1 implementation target, the odds are considerably better than my initial 30%. However, I'm tempering enthusiasm slightly below Forecaster 3's 65% for several reasons: (1) the Q1 target was already missed, demonstrating schedule slippage risk, (2) two institutional hurdles still remain with compressed time, (3) any Senate amendments requiring harmonization could be fatal to the timeline, and (4) the legislative calendar with June recesses creates additional time pressure. The House passage moves this from 'unlikely' territory to 'moderately likely' territory. I'm settling at 55%, acknowledging the strong momentum while respecting the execution risks that have already manifested in missing the Q1 deadline.",
