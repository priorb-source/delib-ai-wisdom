  "information": "As of mid-to-late May 2025, New York Yankees player Aaron Judge had a batting average at or above .400. Reports from May 20th list his average as .401, while other reports from the preceding week cited it as high as .410 and .423. Through his first 46 games, he had a batting average of 0.401. His Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP) was .481, compared to his career average of .344. Statcast data calculated his expected batting average (xBA) at approximately .362.\n\nAs of May 18, 2025, Freddie Freeman of the Los Angeles Dodgers led the National League with a batting average of .375. Other top hitters in the NL included Will Smith (.336), Brendan Donovan (.330), and Manny Machado (.323). One report also listed Shohei Ohtani's average at .370. In contrast, three-time All-Star Marcus Semien was batting .174 for the Texas Rangers.\n\nHistorically, maintaining a .400 batting average is extremely rare in modern baseball. No MLB player has finished a season batting .400 since Ted Williams in 1941. Furthermore, no player in the last 25 seasons has had a batting average of .400 or greater on July 1. In 2023, Luis Arraez's average was .401 on June 23 but fell to .392 by July 1. Factors contributing to this difficulty include lower league-wide Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP), which is .288 in the current era compared to .300 in 1930.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "42 days (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Aaron Judge currently has a .401 batting average",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Judge's batting average regresses below .400 as his unsustainably high BABIP (.481 vs career .344) normalizes toward his expected batting average of .362. Over the next 30-36 games, he hits closer to his true talent level, and his average drops to around .380-.390 by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Judge maintains his hot streak and keeps his batting average at or above .400 through July 1, defying the strong regression indicators. With only 42 days remaining, he has enough of a cushion at .401 to absorb some decline while staying above the threshold, or alternatively, another player like Shohei Ohtani (.370) or Freddie Freeman (.375) gets exceptionally hot.",
    "rationale": "Judge currently sits at .401 with approximately 42 days until the resolution date. This situation presents competing forces: the status quo (he's currently above .400) versus strong regression indicators. The key evidence against maintaining .400: (1) His BABIP of .481 is 137 points above his career average, indicating significant luck; (2) His expected batting average (xBA) is .362, suggesting a 39-point overperformance; (3) No player has been at .400 on July 1 in the last 25 seasons; (4) Luis Arraez dropped from .401 to .392 in just 8 days in 2023. Mathematically, if Judge plays ~35 more games (140 at-bats) and hits at his xBA of .362, he would finish around .384. However, factors supporting a YES outcome include: (1) The relatively short 42-day timeframe (easier than sustaining for a full season); (2) His current 1-point cushion; (3) Judge's elite talent; (4) Random variance could work favorably; (5) Other players (Ohtani at .370) provide additional chances. The historical precedent and statistical regression strongly suggest this is unlikely, but not impossible given the short timeframe. I'm not higher because the regression indicators are overwhelming and no one has achieved this in 25 years on this date. I'm not lower because 42 days is a manageable timeframe and Judge has a cushion. I would update higher if Judge maintains .400+ through early June or if multiple players stay above .380. I would update lower if Judge drops below .390 in the next two weeks.",
