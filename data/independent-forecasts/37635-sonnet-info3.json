  "information": "An international survey by Morning Consult conducted between January 21 and 27, 2025, placed Claudia Sheinbaum's approval rating at 66% and Javier Milei's at 65%. A later report from April 30, 2025, citing Morning Consult data, showed Milei's approval at 61% and Sheinbaum's at 60%. In the January survey, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had the highest approval rating at 75%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 45 days (from May 14 to June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Milei currently leads with 61% approval versus Sheinbaum's 60%",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheinbaum's approval rating increases or Milei's decreases by at least 1 percentage point, resulting in either a tie or Sheinbaum lead. This could occur due to policy announcements, economic developments, or political events in either Mexico or Argentina that shift public sentiment.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milei maintains his current 1-point lead or expands it. This could happen if both leaders' approval ratings remain relatively stable over the next 45 days, or if Milei benefits from positive economic news in Argentina while Sheinbaum faces challenges in Mexico.",
    "rationale": "The most recent data from April 30, 2025 shows Milei leading 61% to 60%, giving him a razor-thin 1 percentage point advantage. Historical data reveals both leaders experienced declining approval from January (Sheinbaum 66%, Milei 65%) to April, with Sheinbaum dropping 6 points compared to Milei's 4-point decline. This suggests recent momentum slightly favoring Milei. However, the current margin is extraordinarily small - well within typical polling margins of error. The 45-day timeframe is relatively short, which normally favors the status quo outcome. Since the question resolves as No for ties, and the margin is effectively statistical noise, this is essentially a near-toss-up with only a slight edge to the current leader. The forecast is not higher because: (1) the 1-point margin could easily reverse with natural polling volatility, (2) both leaders have shown significant approval fluctuations, suggesting instability, and (3) political events in either country could shift dynamics. The forecast is not lower because: (1) status quo bias suggests the current leader has an advantage, (2) the short timeframe limits opportunity for dramatic shifts, and (3) recent trends show Sheinbaum declining faster. To update higher, I would need to see Milei's lead expand to 3+ points in subsequent polls or evidence of sustained upward momentum. To update lower, I would need polls showing Sheinbaum closing the gap or taking the lead, or major political developments favoring Sheinbaum over Milei.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Javier Milei have a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, Sheinbaum is at 60% as compared with Milei at 61%.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Javier Milei has a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum at [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. A tie or a lead by Sheinbaum resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAn international survey by Morning Consult conducted between January 21 and 27, 2025, placed Claudia Sheinbaum's approval rating at 66% and Javier Milei's at 65%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
