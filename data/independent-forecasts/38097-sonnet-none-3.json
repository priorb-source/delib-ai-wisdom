    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (from May 30, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - none of the five named candidates have been disqualified",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "All five candidates (Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, and Simone Gbagbo) remain on the electoral list and legally eligible through July 1, 2025. Any disqualifications that have occurred involve other candidates not on this list.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the five named candidates is removed from the electoral list or declared legally ineligible before July 1, 2025. This could result from judicial decisions, constitutional eligibility challenges, or administrative actions by electoral authorities. Given the BBC article mentions a main opposition leader has already been removed, one of these prominent candidates (particularly the Gbagbos who are high-profile opposition figures) may have already been disqualified.",
    "rationale": "This is a binary question with a very short remaining timeframe of 32 days. The key uncertainty is whether the disqualification mentioned in the BBC article involves one of the five specific candidates listed. The candidates include prominent opposition figures: Laurent Gbagbo (former president), Simone Gbagbo (his wife), and other major opposition leaders. Ivory Coast has a history of contentious electoral processes with candidate disqualifications. The status quo baseline would suggest no disqualification has occurred yet for these specific five candidates, given my research assistant found no additional information confirming this. However, the BBC article reference indicates electoral list removals have occurred. Without confirmation that the removed candidate is one of the five listed, I must weigh: (1) Evidence that disqualifications are happening in this election cycle, (2) These are prominent opposition figures who could be targets, (3) The very short timeframe limits opportunities for new disqualifications, but also means if it happened recently we might not have confirmation yet, (4) The lack of specific information suggests these five particular candidates may not have been affected. My forecast would be higher if I had confirmation one of these five was already disqualified. It would be lower if we had more time remaining or clear evidence all five remain eligible. I'm settling on a moderate probability reflecting genuine uncertainty about whether the reported disqualification involves one of these specific candidates.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these candidates be disqualified from running in the 2025 Ivorian presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBBC: [Main opposition leader removed from Ivory Coast electoral list](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l0j849143o)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) any of these candidates has been removed from the electoral list or otherwise become legally ineligible to run in the [2025 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Ivorian_presidential_election) of the Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) under the laws of the country: Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
