  "information": "In mid-March 2025, Ukraine received a disbursement from an IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) tranche amounting to $400 million, which is equivalent to approximately 16 billion UAH. Furthermore, the first tranche of EU ERA loans, valued at €1 billion, was expected in late March. Domestic bond auctions have continued to raise approximately 26 billion UAH per month. Debt servicing costs for March were reported to be modest.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Minimal. The question pertains to the debt level in March 2025. Given that the current date is April 22, 2025, the official data is expected to be released and reported by the resolution source within days or a few weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Ukraine's government debt has been significantly above the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold for years and has been on a steep upward trajectory due to wartime financing needs. The status quo is a continuation of this borrowing.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would require an unprecedented and unannounced event in March 2025, such as the forgiveness of over 4 trillion UAH (more than 70% of the total debt) by international and domestic creditors. Alternatively, a catastrophic data error or a sudden, radical change in accounting methodology by the official source could lead to this result.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The government of Ukraine continues to finance its wartime budget deficit by borrowing from international partners and issuing domestic bonds. The debt stock, already far exceeding the threshold, increases further in March 2025, ensuring the final figure is well above 1.90 trillion UAH.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the extremely high baseline of Ukraine's government debt leading into March 2025. At the end of 2023, the debt already stood at approximately 5.51 trillion UAH, and it continued to grow into early 2025. This baseline is already nearly three times the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold specified in the question. The information from my research assistant confirms that this trend continued in March 2025. Ukraine received approximately 16 billion UAH from the IMF and raised around 26 billion UAH from domestic bond auctions. These actions directly increased the total debt stock. Therefore, the final figure for March 2025 is certain to be higher than the February 2025 figure, pushing it even further above the threshold. My forecast is not 100% only to account for minuscule tail risks, such as a major clerical error in the data reported by the resolution source or a sudden, unannounced change in their reporting methodology. I would only lower my forecast upon seeing extraordinary evidence of a massive, previously unknown debt forgiveness agreement that was officially recorded in March.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's government debt be at least 1.90 trillion UAH in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's government debt is greater than or equal to 1.90 billion UAH Thousand (in other words, 1.90 trillion Ukrainian hryvnia for the month of March 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/government-debt). Under 1.90 billion UAH Thousand resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn mid-March 2025, Ukraine received a disbursement from an IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) tranche amounting to $400 million, which is equivalent to approximately 16 billion UAH. Furthermore, the first tranche of EU ERA loans, valued at €1 billion, was expected in late March. Domestic bond auctions have continued to raise approximately 26 billion UAH per month. Debt servicing costs for March were reported to be modest.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
