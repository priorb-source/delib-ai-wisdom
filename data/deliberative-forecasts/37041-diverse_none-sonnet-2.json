    "review": "The other forecasters raised several important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 3's clarification that CDC Travel Health Notices are specifically for time-bound outbreak advisories (not routine vaccination recommendations) is crucial - this means we're looking for active outbreak-related notices, raising the bar for what triggers a listing. Forecaster 2's detailed breakdown of the chain of events needed (imported case → local transmission → detection → CDC processing) effectively illustrates how improbable this is within 38 days. Forecaster 3's specific mention of Trinidad and Tobago (past epizootic concerns) and Panama's Darién region (ecological suitability) provides concrete pathways I should have considered more explicitly. The emphasis on historical base rates of North American yellow fever THNs being extremely low is also well-taken. However, I note that all three of us cluster between 5-15%, suggesting reasonable agreement on the core dynamics: very low probability due to status quo and short timeframe, but non-negligible due to the PAHO alert.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward. Forecaster 2's chain-of-events breakdown convincingly shows how many low-probability steps must occur sequentially within just 38 days. The distinction that THNs are for active outbreaks (not routine advisories) raises the threshold for what would trigger a listing. While the PAHO alert is concerning and Forecaster 3's identification of Trinidad & Tobago and Panama as plausible locations is valid, the combination of (1) historically very low base rate of NA yellow fever THNs, (2) extremely compressed timeframe, (3) lack of current evidence that the rising cases mentioned by PAHO include North America, and (4) generally robust public health infrastructure in most of North America all point toward a lower probability than my initial 12%. However, I'm not going as low as Forecaster 2's 5% because the PAHO alert's timing and specificity, plus the ecological plausibility in certain Caribbean and Central American locations, warrant maintaining a risk above trivial levels.",
