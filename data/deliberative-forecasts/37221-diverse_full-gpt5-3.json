    "review": "Both forecasters align with my main takeaways: consensus at 2.1%, a clear disinflation trend from Feb to Mar, negative energy contribution, easing food, decelerating wages, and weak activity. Their emphasis that multiple independent drivers point lower is convincing. The additional point from Forecaster 2 about statistical revisions nudging the figure above the threshold is less persuasive for this resolution, since Trading Economics typically reports to one decimal; a “Yes” likely requires 2.3%, implying a ≥0.2pp upside vs consensus. Neither added new concrete upside catalysts beyond generic volatility. Neither discussed the Easter timing shift (April 2025 vs March 2024), which I see as a modest upside risk via services. Overall, their analyses reinforce my base case rather than shift it.",
    "rationale": "To resolve as Yes on Trading Economics, April must print at least 2.3%. With March at 2.2%, consensus at 2.1%, ongoing negative/flat energy contribution, easing food, slowing wages, and weak demand, the central path is 2.0–2.2. Upside risks are primarily services—potential Easter effects and normal month-to-month noise—which could deliver a +0.1–0.2pp surprise, but the probability of a ≥0.2pp upside vs consensus is limited. I do not adjust upward based on the other forecasters’ arguments; they largely echo evidence I already weighted. Absent high national flashes (e.g., Germany/France/Spain) pointing to broad upside, the balance of risks remains skewed to a No outcome.",
