    "review": "Forecaster 2 introduces a crucial piece of evidence that I had not considered: the failure of the April 2025 foreign ministers' meeting to produce a joint communiqué. This strongly indicates significant internal divisions, making the unanimity required for expansion less likely. Forecaster 3 provides a compelling counter-scenario: a single, politically 'cheap' invitation could be a headline win for the host, Brazil, allowing them to demonstrate momentum without committing to a large, disruptive expansion. They also note that the partner pipeline might be weaker than it appears, with some countries like Kazakhstan opting out of seeking full membership. Both forecasters correctly highlight that Indonesia's recent elevation from partner to full member establishes a viable precedent, which is a point in favor of a 'Yes' outcome that I had not weighed heavily enough.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 15%. The new evidence provided, particularly Forecaster 2's point about the failed joint communiqué in April, reinforces my initial belief that BRICS is in a period of consolidation and institutional stress. High-level internal divisions make achieving unanimous consent for new members extremely difficult. This hard evidence aligns with the public statements from the Brazilian host favoring stabilization over expansion. Forecaster 3’s information that some partner countries are hesitant or have even ruled out seeking full membership (Kazakhstan) further weakens the case for a 'Yes' outcome by suggesting the 'pipeline' of candidates is not as robust as it may seem. While I find Forecaster 3's argument for a 'single cheap win' for Brazil to be a plausible and sophisticated scenario, I assess it as a lower-probability path. Faced with internal discord, a host nation is more likely to pursue a conservative agenda to avoid a public failure than to push for a potentially divisive 'win'. Therefore, I conclude that the new evidence strengthens the arguments for the 'No' outcome more than the 'Yes' outcome, validating my initial, relatively low forecast. The 15% probability continues to represent the non-zero chance that pro-expansion members (China/Russia) successfully lobby for a single symbolic invitation, but the headwinds against this are significant.",
