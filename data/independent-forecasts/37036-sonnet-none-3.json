    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement - Osborn continues exploring without making a formal candidacy announcement by June 1",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Osborn continues his exploration phase beyond June 1, either deciding against running altogether or determining he needs more time to build support, raise funds, and organize before making an announcement. He may also decide to run but delay his announcement until summer or fall 2025 to better align with his campaign strategy.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Osborn completes his exploration within the next 5 weeks and decides to challenge Senator Pete Ricketts in the 2026 midterm election. He makes a formal announcement before June 1, 2025, giving himself approximately 18 months to campaign, fundraise, and build his organization ahead of the November 2026 election.",
    "rationale": "As of April 3, 2025, Dan Osborn was publicly exploring a Senate bid, indicating serious consideration but not commitment. Twenty days have elapsed since that report with no announcement yet, suggesting the exploration is ongoing. The 38-day window until June 1 represents a relatively short timeframe for completing an exploration and announcing. Political candidacy explorations typically last weeks to months as candidates assess viability, build support networks, and secure initial funding commitments. While announcing by late May would provide substantial lead time for a 2026 race (18+ months), there's no compelling reason he must announce by June 1 specifically versus later in summer 2025. Status quo bias strongly applies here - the current state is exploration without announcement, and most political decisions involve careful deliberation rather than rapid action. The probability is not higher because: (1) no announcement has occurred in the 20 days since the Nebraska Examiner report, (2) serious Senate campaigns typically require extensive preparation before announcement, and (3) there's no indication of urgency or imminent announcement. The probability is not lower because: (1) public exploration signals genuine interest and often leads to candidacy, (2) 38 days provides sufficient time for a decision, and (3) early announcement is advantageous for fundraising and organization. I would revise upward with news of campaign staff hiring, fundraising infrastructure, or statements suggesting imminent announcement. I would revise downward if Osborn makes statements about needing more time or signals from his team suggest no near-term decision.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Dan Osborn announce his candidacy for US Senator from Nebraska before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNebraska Examiner: [Nebraska’s Dan Osborn exploring midterm bid against U.S. Sen Pete Ricketts](https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/04/03/nebraskas-dan-osborn-exploring-midterm-bid-against-u-s-sen-pete-ricketts/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Dan Osborn announces his candidacy for US Senator from Nebraska before June 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
