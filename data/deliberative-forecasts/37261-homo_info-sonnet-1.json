    "review": "The other forecasters provide crucial additional information. Forecaster 2 reveals April 5, 2025 'Hands Off!' protests with ~600,000 total participants across 1,200-1,400 events - a major coordinated action I hadn't considered. This is particularly significant because it occurred before the May 1 protests I analyzed. Forecaster 2's point about protest concentration in major metro areas is well-taken; historically, coordinated national protests do feature flagship events with tens of thousands even when distributed widely. Forecaster 3 introduces critical February 2025 data showing trends toward smaller, more distributed protests (60-88 average participants), and importantly notes we're 'already well into 2025 without a reported 10,000+ participant protest.' This last point is crucial - it suggests the Global Protest Tracker may not have documented the April 5 or May 1 events yet, or if it has, may not have recorded any single location with 10,000+ participants. Forecaster 3's skepticism is valuable but may be overly cautious given that April 5 alone had 600,000 total participants. The key insight I'm gaining: there's a distinction between protests occurring with large attendance and those protests being reported by the tracker with specific participant counts exceeding 10,000.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast downward but remaining fairly confident. The evidence now includes two major coordinated protest events (April 5 with 600,000 total participants and May 1 with 1,100+ events), both occurring in the question's timeframe. The April 5 protests are particularly compelling - with 600,000 total participants distributed across 1,200-1,400 locations, basic math suggests average attendance of 430-500 per event. However, protests are not evenly distributed. Historical precedent from major US protests shows significant concentration in cities like Washington DC, NYC, Los Angeles, and Chicago. When the Women's March 2017 saw 4+ million participants nationwide, DC alone had 500,000+. For coordinated national protests with 600,000 total, it would be unusual if no single location reached 10,000. The May 1 protests add further probability. However, three factors warrant downward adjustment from my initial 87%: (1) The critical uncertainty about whether the Global Protest Tracker has actually documented these events - Forecaster 3's observation that we're 'well into 2025 without a reported 10,000+ protest' suggests possible reporting gaps or delays; (2) The February 2025 data showing smaller average protest sizes indicates possible shifts in protest patterns; (3) We need the tracker to specifically report these events with participant counts, not just for them to have occurred. With approximately 2 months remaining, there's adequate time for the tracker to update its database or for additional large protests to materialize. The political environment remains active with multiple mobilizing issues.",
