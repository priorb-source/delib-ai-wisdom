  "information": "In April 2025, several protests occurred in India related to land and religious laws. On April 14, protests against a Muslim land law in eastern India turned violent, resulting in three reported deaths. Separately, from April 8-12, violent protests against the Waqf Act took place in Murshidabad, West Bengal. Muslim communities also held symbolic \"Lights Off\" protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025. Ongoing communal tensions have been noted in West Bengal and Uttarakhand.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo involves high social and political tensions in India surrounding new land and religious laws. Given India's history of mass mobilization, the continuation of these tensions makes it more likely than not that a protest exceeding 10,000 participants will occur and be reported, leading to a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tensions surrounding the new laws de-escalate due to government concessions or a shift in public focus. Alternatively, protests occur but fail to reach the 10,000 participant threshold, or a large protest happens but is not added to the Global Protest Tracker database before the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing anger over the Waqf (Amendment) Act or other land laws prompts a major political party, religious group, or civil society coalition to organize a large-scale demonstration in a major city, which easily surpasses the 10,000 participant threshold and is subsequently reported by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is 70% because the current political and social climate in India is highly conducive to large-scale protests, and the 10,000-participant threshold is relatively low for the Indian context. The primary driver for this forecast is the recent unrest reported in April 2025 concerning new land and religious laws, such as the Waqf Act. These protests, which turned violent, indicate a deep level of public anger and a willingness to mobilize. India has a robust history of mass demonstrations on contentious issues, a pattern that makes a protest of this size likely. My forecast is not higher due to the short two-month timeframe and reliance on a single data source for resolution; a qualifying protest could occur but not be recorded in time. My forecast is not lower because the underlying drivers are potent and recent events show a clear potential for escalation. The issues at hand are deeply emotive and historically have been major catalysts for social unrest. I would increase my forecast upon a formal call for nationwide protests by a major group, and decrease it if the government announced a suspension of the controversial laws.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in India with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nA protest with at least 10,000 participants that is active at the launch of this question does not count for resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn April 2025, several protests occurred in India related to land and religious laws. On April 14, protests against a Muslim land law in eastern India turned violent, resulting in three reported deaths. Separately, from April 8-12, violent protests against the Waqf Act took place in Murshidabad, West Bengal. Muslim communities also held symbolic \"Lights Off\" protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025. Ongoing communal tensions have been noted in West Bengal and Uttarakhand.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
