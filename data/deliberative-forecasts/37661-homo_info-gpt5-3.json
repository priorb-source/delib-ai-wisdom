    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds concrete, new evidence I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: two 10‑year BTRC licenses issued on Apr 30 (including import permission), a public trial on Apr 9, BIDA registration on Mar 29, and public targeting of a May launch. If accurate, those materially de‑risk regulatory hurdles and logistics relative to my prior. Their argument that Starlink often moves from trial to commercial availability within weeks is plausible, but I think their 78% overweights best‑case execution and underweights the tendency for the public map flip to coincide with live ordering, which depends on tariff/pricing approval, tax setup, payments, and inventory in-country. \n\nForecaster 3’s 62% captures both the acceleration potential from high‑level approval and the real risk that post‑approval steps slip beyond six weeks. I agree with their point that U.S. political noise is unlikely to be a near‑term blocker in Bangladesh. I also note their reminder that only “Available” counts for resolution; a pure “Waitlist” or “Coming Soon” outcome would not resolve Yes. Overall, I find F3’s balance more convincing than F2’s optimism, though F2’s specific licensing/import details shift my baseline upward.\n",
    "rationale": "Updating on the reported Apr 30 issuance of long‑term licenses plus import permission, prior public trial, and explicit target of a May launch, the main regulatory gates appear substantially cleared. With ~45 days left, a June availability flip is feasible if: (a) BTRC signs off on tariffs/pricing, (b) VAT/tax and payment rails are enabled on Starlink’s site for Bangladeshi orders, and (c) terminals have cleared customs and are staged. Starlink can serve via ISL without a local gateway, reducing technical risk.\n\nCounterweights: Bangladesh’s tariff approval and commercial enablement can be bureaucratic; Starlink typically marks a country “Available” only when it can accept orders and ship, and we’ve seen slippage from this point extend beyond a month in comparable markets. As of mid‑May there’s no public Bangladesh pricing on Starlink’s site and no launch announcement, suggesting some of these steps are still pending. That keeps a meaningful chance the public map flip slips into July.\n\nNet: The new licensing/import evidence moves me up materially from my prior 35%, but I remain below the 60–80% range absent clear signs of tariff approval and live ordering. I’ll set a modestly optimistic stance centered on a late‑June go‑live being possible but far from assured.\n",
