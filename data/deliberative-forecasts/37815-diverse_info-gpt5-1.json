    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a concrete base-rate model: 1–2 South America pilot reports per year at NUFORC, implying ~8–17% per month and ~12% using a Poisson λ≈0.125. That is a useful framing and highlights that my initial 24% implicitly assumed ~3+ per year. Forecaster 3 rightly notes that AARO/FAA U.S. data are largely irrelevant to NUFORC’s South America + pilot + month-specific funnel and emphasizes the rarity of such reports. I think F3’s 5% is too low if we accept F2’s 1–2/year assumption and an even monthly distribution; it would imply <0.7/year, which seems inconsistent with the cited Brazil Dec 2024 case and general NUFORC pilot category activity. I also partially disagree with the weight placed on NUFORC posting delays; the resolution allows checking on or after July 1, so routine lag is unlikely to be decisive unless unusually long. F2’s mention of barriers (language, alternative local channels) and the US-centric intake aligns with my earlier concerns. Neither forecaster considered that U.S. or other international pilots flying South American airspace may submit to NUFORC, slightly mitigating language/awareness barriers, but that only modestly lifts odds.",
    "rationale": "I’m updating downward from 24% to align more closely with the base rate. The key driver is the low historical frequency of NUFORC pilot-tagged reports from South America—plausibly ~1–2 per year—combined with a narrow one-month window. Using a Poisson model with λ in the 0.08–0.17/month range implies a 1−e^{−λ} of roughly 8–16%; adopting the midpoint (λ≈0.125) yields ~12%. I keep a small upward adjustment to 14% to reflect: (1) international pilots (including U.S. carriers) operating over South America who are more likely to use NUFORC; (2) ongoing visibility of satellite trains and occasional re-entries that can trigger pilot reports; and (3) the precedent of a recent Brazil pilot report showing the pipeline is active. I do not go higher because NUFORC remains US-centric, pilot-tagged entries are a small subset, and language/reporting-channel frictions are real. I do not go as low as 5% because that would underweight the observed feasibility and the multiple-country, many-flight opportunities within a month. Net: base-rate anchored with a modest upward nudge.",
