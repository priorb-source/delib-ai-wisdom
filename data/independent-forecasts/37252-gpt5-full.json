  "information": "South Korea has been experiencing significant political instability. President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in December 2024, leading to his impeachment. The country's Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment on April 4, 2025. Following these events, a snap presidential election has been scheduled for June 3, 2025. Additionally, law enforcement authorities recently conducted a search of former President Yoon's residence as part of corruption allegations.\n\nSeveral large-scale protests have occurred in South Korea in the first half of 2025. On January 4, an estimated 35,000 people protested. On February 2, reports on participant numbers in an anti-Yoon protest ranged from 38,000 to 100,000. On February 15, a rally in Seoul demanding impeachment reportedly involved 300,000 people. On March 29, a protest demanding the president's resignation was estimated at 12,000 participants. On May 1, a Labor Day rally in Seoul organized by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) had over 8,000 participants, with police estimating attendance as high as 13,000.\n\nMultiple civic and political groups have been actively organizing demonstrations. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) and the Democratic Labor Union held rallies for Labor Day on May 1. The KCTU has also announced its intention to organize a general strike in July. Groups such as 'Free Korea' and 'Candlelight Action' have consistently held rallies and counter-rallies in response to political developments. Conservative groups have also planned a rally for May 18th in Gwangju.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (from May 1, 2025 to June 30, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the tracker continues to treat the ongoing anti-government mobilization as a single movement that began before the question launched, so no new entry has a post–launch start date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Campaigning and the June 3 snap presidential election proceed without spawning a distinct new wave. Any 10,000+ gatherings (e.g., May 18 Gwangju commemoration, labor rallies) are folded by the Global Protest Tracker into the late-2024/early-2025 anti-government movement, whose start date predates the question’s launch.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A clearly new protest wave of 10,000+ participants begins after May 1—most plausibly large post-election demonstrations (e.g., alleging irregularities or responding to an unexpected outcome) or a separate, issue-specific mass rally—and the Global Protest Tracker creates a distinct entry with a May–June 2025 start date.",
    "rationale": "Evidence: South Korea has seen repeated mass mobilizations in 2025: ~35k (Jan 4), 38k–100k (Feb 2), ~300k (Feb 15), ~12k (Mar 29), and 8k–13k (May 1). Polarization remains high after President Yoon’s impeachment was upheld (Apr 4), and a snap presidential election is set for June 3. Organizers like KCTU remain active; conservatives also plan rallies (e.g., May 18, Gwangju). These facts indicate the capacity and propensity for 10k+ demonstrations in the near term.\nKey uncertainty is the Global Protest Tracker’s curation logic. GPT typically catalogs major protest waves/movements rather than every rally, and often assigns a single start date to a broader episode. Given ACLED’s framing of a surge beginning with the December 2024 martial law declaration, GPT could characterize subsequent large rallies as part of one continuous anti-government movement starting in late 2024 or early 2025. If so, even sizeable May–June events would not satisfy the ‘start date after launch’ condition.\nWhy not higher: Although large protests are likely around the election and commemorations, the most probable cataloging is a continuation of the late-2024/early-2025 movement, yielding a pre–question-launch start date. The general strike KCTU is signaling is in July (outside the window). Many campaign events are not protests per se.\nWhy not lower: The June 3 election is a strong focal point that could trigger a distinct new wave (e.g., post-election contention) that GPT could list separately with a fresh start date in June. Even absent election disputes, a sizable new issue-specific mobilization in May–June is plausible given the recent scale and frequency of protests.\nUpdates: I would move higher if (1) credible reporting shows 10k+ demonstrations beginning after May 1 framed as a new phase (e.g., ‘post-election protests’) or (2) GPT adds a new South Korea entry explicitly dated May–June 2025. I would move lower if the campaign period remains relatively calm, the election outcome is widely accepted without mass protests, or GPT visibly consolidates 2025 protests under a start date before May 1.",
