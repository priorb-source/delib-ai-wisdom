  "information": "As of early May 2025, Republika Srpska (RS) has taken several legislative and political steps. A draft for a new constitution, which includes rights to self-determination and provisions for confederal relationships, completed its public consultation phase in mid-April 2025. The RS government has also passed laws to ban Bosnia's central judicial, police, and intelligence agencies from operating within its territory. Milorad Dodik, the leader of RS, has stated he is willing to declare independence if the central authorities, with international support, attempt to take control of RS property. Similarly, Nenad Stevanović, President of the RS Parliament, warned that continued pressure would lead to a declaration of independence, stating that RS is a functional entity capable of implementing its decisions independently.\n\nInternational reactions to the political situation in Republika Srpska are varied. The U.S. and EU have expressed strong opposition to secession, with a U.S. envoy labeling RS's proposals as \"secession by another name.\" The U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo has warned that disobeying the decisions of Bosnia's Constitutional Court, such as celebrating the banned January 9th holiday, may constitute a criminal offense. In contrast, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković has expressed support for Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership while voicing concern over secessionist rhetoric from RS, warning that delays in EU integration could allow Russia and China to increase their influence. Russia has appeared supportive of moves by RS, and a Russian military documentary film festival was scheduled to take place in Banja Luka in May 2025.\n\nHistorical and legal precedents provide context for a potential referendum. Bosnia's Constitutional Court has ruled on multiple occasions that celebrating Republika Srpska Day on January 9 is unconstitutional. Despite this, RS held a parade for the banned holiday in January 2025. Analysis of other independence movements shows varying timelines: the process for Catalonia's 2017 referendum took approximately 7-8 months from legislative groundwork to the announcement, while Scotland's 2014 referendum process took about 2 years. In contrast, Crimea's 2014 referendum, under Russian influence, was organized in about two weeks. The political structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina is based on the 1995 Dayton Agreement, which divided the country into two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months until July 1, 2025 deadline",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Republika Srpska does not officially announce an independence referendum date",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "RS leadership continues aggressive rhetoric and legislative actions but stops short of announcing a referendum date, either due to international pressure, economic concerns, internal divisions, or a strategic calculation to maintain leverage through threats without crossing the critical line of actually scheduling a vote.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milorad Dodik or another authorized RS official announces a specific date for an independence referendum, potentially triggered by intensified international pressure, a Constitutional Court ruling against RS, or as a strategic escalation to consolidate domestic support. The announcement could occur quickly given the Crimea precedent of organizing a referendum in two weeks.",
    "rationale": "This forecast weighs several competing factors. On one hand, RS has demonstrated significant escalation: defying the Constitutional Court with the January 9 parade, passing laws banning central authorities, drafting a new constitution with self-determination provisions, and issuing explicit independence threats from both Dodik and Stevanović. The legislative groundwork appears in place, and historical precedent shows referendums can be organized quickly (Crimea's two weeks). With only two months until the deadline, any decision must come soon. Russian support and the pattern of escalation suggest momentum exists. On the other hand, status quo bias strongly favors inaction - announcing a referendum date represents a massive escalation beyond current positioning. The difference between threatening independence and officially scheduling a vote is enormous. Strong US and EU opposition creates significant deterrents through potential economic sanctions and international isolation. RS may calculate that threatening independence provides more leverage than actually scheduling it, which would force responses from all parties. Catalonia and Scotland precedents show longer timelines (7-8 months to 2 years), though these occurred in different political contexts. No specific triggering event has yet occurred that would precipitate immediate action. The forecast of 30% reflects genuine possibility given recent actions and tight timeframe, but gives greater weight to status quo since actually announcing remains a dramatic step with severe consequences. I would update higher if: a specific trigger event occurs (major court ruling, new sanctions), Dodik provides specific timeline statements, constitutional draft is formally adopted, or Russia provides explicit support for referendum. I would update lower if: signs of de-escalation emerge, diplomatic interventions succeed, economic pressure intensifies, or internal RS opposition develops.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early May 2025, Republika Srpska (RS) has taken several legislative and political steps.
