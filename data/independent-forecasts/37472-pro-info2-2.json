  "information": "The political landscape in Bangladesh is currently shaped by an interim government led by Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus. This government has stated its priority is a reform agenda and has indicated that national elections might be delayed until June 2026. On May 6, 2025, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina's long-time political rival, returned to Bangladesh after receiving four months of medical treatment in London. Following her return, her party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), has increased pressure on the interim government to hold elections sooner, with some leaders demanding polls be held by December 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month, 23 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Sheikh Hasina remains outside of Bangladesh, and the interim government continues its reform agenda without her physical presence in the country.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Faced with credible threats of arrest from the interim government and preferring to choose a more politically opportune moment, Sheikh Hasina remains abroad past the July 1 deadline. She continues to issue statements and lead her party from exile, waiting for the political climate to become more favorable.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Pressured by the recent return of her political arch-rival Khaleda Zia and seeking to re-assert her leadership, Sheikh Hasina makes a high-stakes return to Bangladesh. She arrives to rally her Awami League supporters, willing to risk potential arrest to counter the BNP's resurgence and challenge the interim government's authority directly.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on a balancing of two powerful, opposing forces. The primary factor against her return (favoring a 'No' outcome) is the current political reality. An interim government is in power with a reform agenda, which likely includes holding past leaders accountable. This poses a significant personal risk of arrest and legal jeopardy for Sheikh Hasina should she return. The status quo is that she is out of the country, and maintaining this is the path of least resistance. However, the political calculus was dramatically altered by the return of her rival, Khaleda Zia, on May 6, 2025. This event creates immense pressure on Hasina to return to remain politically relevant, lead her party, and counter the narrative of her opponents. Her own vow to return further commits her to this path. The short timeframe (before July 1) makes a quick, reactive return plausible. I have weighted the risk of arrest and the interim government's control of the state as slightly more powerful than the political pressure to return, hence a probability below 50%. The forecast is not lower because the political imperative created by Zia's return is a game-changing variable that makes a swift return a very real possibility. The forecast is not higher because the interim government has both the motive and the means to prevent her return or arrest her upon arrival, a risk she is unlikely to take without some form of assurance. I would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of negotiations for her safe return. I would decrease it if the interim government issues a formal arrest warrant or makes explicit threats against her.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sheikh Hasina return to Bangladesh before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFirstpost: [Bangladesh has turned into a ‘terrorist country’: Sheikh Hasina targets Yunus, vows to return](https://www.firstpost.com/world/bangladesh-has-turned-into-a-terrorist-country-sheikh-hasina-targets-yunus-vows-to-return-13878191.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
