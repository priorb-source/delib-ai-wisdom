    "review": "My initial forecast of 95% was overconfident as it failed to seriously consider the specifics of the resolution source. I focused almost exclusively on the high probability of a large protest occurring, overlooking how the Global Protest Tracker (GPT) might catalog it. Forecaster 2 correctly identified this as a key uncertainty. Forecaster 3's analysis was decisive. Their argument that the GPT tends to log broad protest movements with a single start date is a critical insight. If the tracker bundles all 2025 anti-government activity into a single entry starting in Dec 2024 or Jan 2025, then even a massive protest in June would not satisfy the 'start date after launch' criterion. This represents the most significant and plausible path to a 'No' resolution, a path my initial analysis completely missed. Forecaster 3’s reasoning is highly convincing and forces a major re-evaluation of the core drivers of the forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am making a significant downward update to my forecast, from 95% to 50%. My initial analysis correctly identified that the political environment in South Korea makes another 10,000+ person protest extremely likely before July 1. However, as Forecaster 3 adeptly pointed out, the core uncertainty is not whether a protest will happen, but how it will be recorded by the Global Protest Tracker (GPT).\n\nThe GPT's methodology of cataloging broad 'protest movements' with a single start date is the pivotal factor. There is a very high probability that any further rallies leading up to the June 3rd election will be categorized as part of the ongoing anti-government/impeachment movement that began well before this question's launch on May 1, 2025. In this highly plausible scenario, the question would resolve as 'No' regardless of the size of the protests.\n\nThe question will only resolve 'Yes' if a large protest occurs *and* is classified by the GPT as a new, distinct movement with its own start date after May 1. The presidential election on June 3 provides the most likely catalyst for such a new movement, for instance, if protests erupt to contest the election results or to oppose the incoming administration. The chance of such a new, distinct protest wave emerging and being cataloged separately is significant, but far from certain.\n\nMy updated forecast of 50% reflects this bifurcation. It combines the near-certainty of a large protest event with the roughly 50/50 uncertainty of whether that event will be framed by the resolution source as a *new* movement, thereby satisfying the specific criteria for a 'Yes' resolution.",
