  "information": "According to the US Census Bureau, the US trade deficit for goods reached a record $162 billion in March 2025, a 9.6% increase from February. This was driven by a surge in imports, which increased by $16.3 billion to $342.7 billion. This rise in imports was attributed to businesses stockpiling goods in anticipation of new tariffs. US exports of goods in March 2025 increased by $2.2 billion to $180.8 billion, a 1.2% increase from February and a 6.8% increase from March 2024.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The US Census Bureau typically releases monthly trade data about 6 weeks after the month ends, so April 2025 data should be published in early to mid-June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - exports will exceed the April 2024 baseline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Retaliatory tariffs from trading partners in response to Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs significantly reduce demand for US exports in April. Export orders decline particularly in manufacturing and agriculture sectors. Services exports also weaken due to global economic uncertainty and reduced business travel/tourism. The combination results in April 2025 total exports falling below $262.578 billion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The positive export momentum from March 2025 continues into April. US goods exports maintain their year-over-year growth trajectory of approximately 7%, supported by strong foreign demand and potentially favorable exchange rates. Services exports remain robust, driven by continuing demand for US professional services, technology, and intellectual property. Total exports for April 2025 exceed the $262.578 billion threshold.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report provides critical context: March 2025 goods exports were $180.8 billion, representing a 6.8% year-over-year increase from March 2024. This growth occurred despite the tariff environment mentioned in the background article. The threshold of $262.578 billion represents the April 2024 baseline that must be exceeded. Assuming goods represent roughly 65-70% of total exports (with services making up the remainder), March 2025 total exports would have been approximately $260-270 billion. If April maintains similar proportions and growth rates, it would likely exceed the threshold. Key supporting factors: (1) March demonstrated export resilience with 6.8% growth, (2) the month-over-month increase from February to March suggests positive momentum, (3) businesses were actively engaging in international trade despite tariff concerns. Countervailing risks include: (1) retaliatory tariffs from trading partners could suppress April exports, (2) the timing and implementation of 'liberation day' tariffs could have disrupted April more than March, (3) services export data is not provided and could underperform. My forecast is not higher because tariff retaliation effects may materialize more strongly in April than March, and we lack services export data. It's not lower because the March data shows strong fundamental export growth that typically persists month-to-month absent major shocks. I would update higher if early April trade indicators showed continued strong growth, or lower if reports emerged of significant order cancellations or retaliatory measures taking effect.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US exports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
