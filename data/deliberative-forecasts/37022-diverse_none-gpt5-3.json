    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a concrete and highly relevant datapoint I hadn’t explicitly cited: Trading Economics shows Feb 2025 at ~6.01 trillion UAH. That directly addresses the resolution source, strongly reducing any lingering definitional risk. Their logic about the implausibility of a >4T UAH drop in one month is sound. Forecaster 3 relies on general wartime dynamics and treats 1.90T as a meaningful benchmark; that underestimates how far above 1.90T Ukraine’s debt has been for years. Given the TE Feb figure, 78% is far too low absent evidence of a massive March write‑off or data anomaly.\n",
    "rationale": "My prior 97% already reflected that Ukraine’s public debt in UAH terms has been multiple trillions since 2022 and rising. Forecaster 2’s specific TE reading for Feb 2025 (~6.01T UAH) sharply lowers residual uncertainty about series definition and level at the resolution source. A fall below 1.90T in March would require an unprecedented, unannounced multi‑trillion UAH write‑off or a severe data error at TE; neither is plausible, and wartime financing in early 2025 points to stable or higher debt. I’m increasing my forecast to reflect this direct evidence while keeping a sliver of probability for a data glitch or metadata change.\n",
