    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 4 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The Colorado Rockies have been one of the worst teams in baseball for several years, a trend supported by reports of organizational dysfunction and a struggling farm system. The status quo is a continuation of this poor performance, making them a prime candidate for the league's worst record.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies go on a brief winning streak in late May or early June. Simultaneously, another struggling team, such as the Oakland Athletics or Chicago White Sox, endures a severe losing spell, possibly due to injuries or a difficult schedule, causing their winning percentage to drop below Colorado's by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies continue to play with a level of performance consistent with their roster's talent and their results from the first month and a half of the season. They struggle with their pitching, particularly on the road, and fail to win series, ensuring their winning percentage remains at or near the bottom of the MLB standings.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the strong influence of the status quo over a short timeframe. The question resolves in about four weeks, and by this point in the season (May 19), team talent levels are well-established. The Colorado Rockies have consistently been one of the league's worst teams, a situation highlighted by the provided background article indicating deep-seated organizational problems. Their challenges, especially in developing a competent pitching staff for their home ballpark, are chronic and not easily solved mid-season. The most likely scenario is that the trends established over the first 45-50 games of the season continue for the next 25-30 games.\n\nMy probability is not higher because there are other teams with comparable levels of low talent, chief among them the Oakland Athletics and Chicago White Sox. Baseball has significant day-to-day variance, and a short hot streak by the Rockies or a cold streak by another bottom-tier team could easily change the outcome. The difference between the 30th and 29th worst teams is often marginal, so while the Rockies are a strong candidate, it is far from a certainty. There are at least two other credible candidates for this distinction.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the fundamental weaknesses of the Rockies organization are profound. Unlike some other rebuilding teams that have elite prospects or a clear front-office strategy, the Rockies appear to lack a clear direction. This makes a sudden, sustained improvement in performance highly unlikely. For the outcome to be 'No', it would likely require another team to actively perform worse, which is certainly possible, but the Rockies' established record of poor play makes them the most probable holder of the lowest winning percentage.\n\nI would update my forecast upwards if other bottom-tier teams (like the A's or White Sox) show surprising signs of competence or go on a winning streak. I would update downwards if the Rockies suffer major injuries to their few productive players, solidifying their position at the bottom.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMile High Sports: [The Colorado Rockies have lost a generation of fans](https://milehighsports.com/the-colorado-rockies-have-lost-a-generation-of-fans/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
