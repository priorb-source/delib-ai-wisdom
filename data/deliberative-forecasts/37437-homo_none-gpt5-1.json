    "review": "Both forecasters closely mirror my priors: very short timeline, extremely high bar (PLA ground landing) with likely observable precursors, and an additional linguistic hurdle because the resolution requires a U.S. government accusation of an invasion by ground forces. They add nuance on Beijing’s preference for gray-zone, coast guard, or paramilitary tactics to muddy attribution and on the likelihood that Washington might choose calibrated language (“seizure,” “attack”) for limited outlying-island scenarios. Their indicator sets (RO-RO requisitions, amphibious staging, maritime/airspace closures, U.S./ally posture shifts) are aligned with my own. I don’t see new evidence, but I find their emphasis on language discipline and paramilitary ambiguity reinforcing. No argument pushes me meaningfully off my prior.",
    "rationale": "~8 weeks remain. The baseline is continued coercion below the ground-landing threshold. A PLA landing—whether main island or an outlying islet—would be strategically momentous, risky, and likely preceded by visible mobilization and maritime/airspace control measures. None are flagged. Even if a limited grab occurred, the U.S. might avoid the specific “invasion by ground forces” framing, which is required for a Yes resolution. Tail risk persists (e.g., a rapid move on Pratas/Kinmen with PLA Marines or airborne), but both operational and political incentives for Beijing argue against doing so on this timeline, and the added U.S.-language hurdle further lowers odds. I remain at a very low but non-zero probability. Upward triggers: credible reports of PLA amphib/airborne mobilization, RO-RO requisitions, exclusion zones, civilian shipping disruptions, U.S./ally posture surges, or actual PLA landings. Downward triggers: continued routine activity into mid-June without mobilization and/or de-escalatory diplomatic signals.",
