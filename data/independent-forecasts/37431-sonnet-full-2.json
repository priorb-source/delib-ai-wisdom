  "information": "The recall, issued on April 24, 2025, by ACC Central Kitchen LLC, is for approximately 64,000 to 65,000 pounds of frozen pork bun products. The recall is classified as Class I and was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared sesame allergen. The affected products were produced over an extended period, with some items dating back to November 2023. Distribution was limited to retail locations in New York. There have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption of these products.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) oversees the recall process. For a recall to be formally closed, the FSIS must complete effectiveness checks and verify that the company has removed all affected products from commerce, notified customers, and implemented corrective actions. Historical data for similar recalls show varied timelines; medium-scale allergen recalls (10,000-100,000 lbs) typically take 60 to 120 days to close. Other analyses suggest a mean closure time of 45 days for allergen/misbranding recalls, with about half of comparable recalls in 2023-2024 closing within 70 days.\n\nSeveral factors specific to this recall may influence its duration. Factors that could lead to a longer resolution time include the substantial volume of the product, the long production window, and the product's frozen nature, which means it may remain in consumer freezers for longer periods. Conversely, factors that could shorten the timeline include the recall's limited geographical scope (only New York), the reason being a misbranding/allergen issue rather than pathogen contamination (which typically involves a more complex investigation), and the company's proactive and voluntary initiation of the recall.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "57 days from today (May 5, 2025) until July 1, 2025. The recall was issued 11 days ago on April 24, 2025, giving a total window of 68 days from recall issuance to the resolution date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The recall remains Active. Since the recall was just issued 11 days ago and is currently in Active status, the default outcome if nothing changes is that it stays Active through July 1, 2025, resulting in a No resolution.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall remains Active on July 1, 2025 because FSIS effectiveness checks take longer than 68 days to complete. The large volume (65,000 lbs), extended production window (November 2023 to April 2025), and frozen nature of the products mean many items remain in consumer freezers and commerce. Verification of complete product removal and corrective action implementation extends beyond the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recall closes before July 1, 2025 because the company executes an efficient recall program. The limited geographical distribution (New York only) and allergen-based nature (rather than pathogen contamination) simplify tracking and verification. With no reported illnesses and a voluntary, proactive recall, FSIS completes effectiveness checks and verifies corrective actions within the 68-day window.",
    "rationale": "The recall has existed for 11 days with 57 days remaining until July 1, giving a total 68-day window. Historical data shows mixed signals: the mean closure time for allergen/misbranding recalls is 45 days (which would suggest closure by June 8), and approximately half of comparable 2023-2024 recalls closed within 70 days. However, medium-scale allergen recalls (10,000-100,000 lbs) typically take 60-120 days, placing 68 days near the lower end of this range.\n\nFavorable factors include: limited geographical scope (New York only makes tracking easier), the allergen/misbranding classification (simpler than pathogen investigations), voluntary proactive recall by the company, and no reported illnesses (reducing investigation complexity).\n\nChallenging factors include: substantial volume (65,000 lbs requires extensive verification), extremely long production window (17 months from November 2023 to April 2025 complicates tracking), and frozen product nature (items can remain in consumer freezers for extended periods, making complete removal from commerce difficult to verify).\n\nGiven the status quo bias toward Active status and the mixed historical data, I assess this as slightly below even odds. The 68-day window sits right around the median (70 days) but within a range where many recalls take longer. The frozen product aspect is particularly concerning for timely closure.\n\nThis forecast would increase if evidence emerges of rapid company action, quick verification progress, or simpler-than-expected effectiveness checks. It would decrease if complications arise, more affected products are discovered, or frozen products prove difficult to recall from circulation.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
