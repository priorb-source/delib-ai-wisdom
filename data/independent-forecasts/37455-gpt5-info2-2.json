  "information": "Starlink's service rollout timelines in other African nations have varied. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a license was granted around May 3-5, 2025, and service availability was announced by May 5, with the launch expected within days. The company also received a license from Somalia in April 2025. However, Starlink has faced regulatory challenges in other countries; it lacks a full operating license in South Africa, and authorities in Zimbabwe have asked the company to disconnect kits operating illegally in the country.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the Starlink map does not currently show Lesotho as Available.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Lesotho license requires additional steps (e.g., terminal type approval, spectrum/landing rights finalization, tax/VAT setup, local distribution/payment rails). Starlink keeps Lesotho as Coming Soon/Waitlist through June, potentially to avoid regulatory friction with neighboring South Africa or due to logistics, so the map never flips to Available before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink finalizes any remaining administrative steps and updates the availability map within the next few weeks, enabling orders and marking at least some area in Lesotho as Available (similar to the rapid license-to-availability cadence seen in DRC).",
    "rationale": "Lesotho granted Starlink a license on April 14, 2025. Starlink has recently moved quickly in some African markets after licensing: in DRC a license around May 3–5 was followed by availability announcements by May 5 with launch expected within days. Somalia also granted a license in April. This suggests that, once licensed, Starlink can flip the map to Available rapidly, especially now that inter-satellite links reduce dependence on local gateways. The time window remaining (~54 days) is ample for such a change. Countervailing factors: (1) As of today, the map still does not show Lesotho as Available despite ~3 weeks since license, hinting at possible remaining steps (type approvals, pricing/tax, reseller arrangements, or regulatory conditions). (2) Lesotho is a small market and is enclave within South Africa, where Starlink lacks a full operating license; Starlink may be cautious to avoid spillover usage and related regulatory tensions, which could slow rollout. (3) Starlink has faced regulatory pushback in some countries (e.g., Zimbabwe disconnecting illegal kits), showing willingness to delay or restrict service when compliance isn’t fully in place. Reasons the probability isn’t higher: the lack of a flip after several weeks post-license and potential administrative/logistical friction or political sensitivities tied to South Africa. Reasons it isn’t lower: the license is already granted; recent precedent (DRC) shows Starlink can move in days; and ~54 days remain, which is plenty based on typical rollouts. Upward updates: official Starlink/LCA statements confirming equipment approvals, pricing/orders in Lesotho, local reseller announcements, or signs that Somalia/DRC rollouts continue to flip the map quickly. Downward updates: indications of additional regulatory hurdles in Lesotho (e.g., delayed type approval), statements tying Lesotho activation to South African regulatory outcomes, or the Starlink map showing only Coming Soon for nearby new-license countries through late May/June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Lesotho as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lesotho grants license to Musk's Starlink](https://www.ewn.co.za/2025/04/14/lesotho-grants-license-to-musks-starlink)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Lesotho listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nStarlink's service rollout timelines in other African nations have varied. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a license was granted around May 3-5, 2025, and service availability was announced by May 5, with the launch expected within days. The company also received a license from Somalia in April 2025. However, Starlink has faced regulatory challenges in other countries; it lacks a full operating license in South Africa, and authorities in Zimbabwe have asked the company to disconnect kits operating illegally in the country.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
