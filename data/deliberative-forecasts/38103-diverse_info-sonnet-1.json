    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical point that I initially underweighted: the resolution depends on the page TEXT specifically mentioning Tesla as ineligible, not just the policy continuing. They identify a meaningful risk (20-30%) that BC Hydro revises the page to use brand-neutral language like 'U.S.-produced goods excluded' without explicitly naming Tesla, which would resolve as No even if Tesla remains ineligible in practice. This is a genuine communications consideration - organizations sometimes shift away from brand-specific language due to legal liability concerns or to appear less targeted. Forecaster 2's 97% appears to overlook this resolution quirk entirely, focusing solely on policy continuity. However, I think Forecaster 3 may slightly overweight the wording-change risk. The March 12 announcement was explicit and recent, the page was likely updated to reflect this specificity for consumer clarity, and only one month remains - a very short window for communications teams to decide on and implement such a revision. The explicit naming helps consumers who heard 'Tesla excluded' in news coverage understand what applies to them.",
    "rationale": "I maintain that policy continuity is nearly certain (~95%+) given the short timeframe, broader trade context, and Tesla's weakening market position. However, Forecaster 3's insight about the resolution mechanism is valid and important. There are two distinct paths to a No outcome: (1) policy reversal (~3-5% chance), and (2) page wording changed to generic U.S.-exclusion language while policy continues (~15-20% chance). The wording-change risk is real but somewhat limited by: the recency of the explicit announcement (2.5 months ago), consumer clarity needs, the short timeframe until resolution, and the fact that the government deliberately chose explicit language initially. Legal or diplomatic pressure could prompt language changes, but absent signs of such pressure, maintaining the explicit Tesla mention is more likely. My forecast should acknowledge both risks while recognizing that the base case - Tesla explicitly mentioned as excluded on July 1 - remains most probable.",
