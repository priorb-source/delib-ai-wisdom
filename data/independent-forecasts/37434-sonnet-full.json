  "information": "According to its latest financial reports, AquaBounty Technologies' cash reserves declined from $9.2 million at the end of 2023 to $230,000 as of December 31, 2024. The company reported a GAAP EPS of -$29.47 and revenue of $0.79 million for the fiscal year, a 68% year-over-year decrease. The company's former CFO stated, \"We do not have sufficient liquidity to continue operations,\" and management has issued a going-concern warning. The company's reported debt-to-equity ratio is 0.05.\n\nIn December 2024, AquaBounty announced it was ceasing fish farming activities, shutting down its last operational facility, and culling its remaining fish stock. The company laid off \"substantially all\" of its staff at the site. With production halted, there is no operating cash inflow. Management has acknowledged that its capital-raising efforts have been unsuccessful for over a year and has stated it is \"assessing alternatives\" for its Ohio facility.\n\nBy March 2025, AquaBounty's market capitalization had fallen to approximately $2.2 million, with its stock price dropping from a 52-week high of $3.05 to well below $1. The stock is trading below the NASDAQ compliance threshold, risking delisting. Despite the low price, institutional investor Epiq Partners LLC increased its holdings in the company by 423.5% in the fourth quarter. As of early 2025, institutional investors and hedge funds own 8.92% of the company's stock.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months (approximately 57 days from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - AquaBounty has not filed for bankruptcy yet despite severe financial distress",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty secures emergency financing, completes an asset sale or merger, or manages to survive on minimal cash burn by reducing expenses to near-zero while avoiding creditor action through the July 1 deadline. With low debt levels (0.05 debt-to-equity), creditor pressure may be minimal enough to avoid forced bankruptcy filing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty exhausts its remaining cash reserves, cannot meet basic obligations, and files for Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. With only $230K reported in December 2024, zero operational revenue, and failed capital-raising efforts, the company runs out of options and management determines formal bankruptcy is necessary to wind down operations or reorganize.",
    "rationale": "The financial situation is dire: cash declined 97.5% to $230K by end of 2024, operations ceased in December 2024, revenue dropped 68% to only $0.79M, and the CFO explicitly stated insufficient liquidity. These are classic bankruptcy indicators. However, several factors create uncertainty: (1) AquaBounty has survived 4+ months since the December report without filing, suggesting they found ways to minimize cash burn; (2) The debt-to-equity ratio of 0.05 is remarkably low, meaning minimal creditor pressure to force bankruptcy; (3) An institutional investor significantly increased holdings in Q4, suggesting some believe assets retain value; (4) Only 57 days remain until the resolution date. Companies in similar situations sometimes avoid bankruptcy by negotiating informal workouts, completing distressed asset sales, or finding last-minute strategic partners. The low debt burden is particularly important - without aggressive creditors, management has more flexibility to pursue alternatives. That said, with no operations and no successful capital raises in over a year, bankruptcy remains the most likely path. I'm not higher (>75%) because they've already demonstrated unexpected resilience by surviving this long, and the short timeframe means they only need to last 8 more weeks. I'm not lower (<65%) because the fundamentals are catastrophic and bankruptcy is typically how defunct companies formally wind down.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
