    "review": "Forecaster 2 is right that getting to 5 destinations is unlikely, but their emphasis on the 6‑week window and possibility of charters misses two key points: (1) FlightsFrom lists scheduled destinations in the next 12 months from the check date, so routes starting later in 2025 could still count if filed by July 1; (2) ad‑hoc charters wouldn’t count unless filed as scheduled service. Still, their overall direction (headwinds + inertia) is sound. Forecaster 3’s 42% feels high and also leans on the short timeline; they don’t engage with the scheduled-vs-charter distinction or the schedule-loading cycles. Both analyses reinforce that current state likely sits at 3–4 destinations (GUM, ICN, often PUS, intermittent NRT), and getting a fifth requires either HKG or another KR/JP city being in OAG by July 1. That remains a stretch given weak Japan demand and uncertain HKG execution.",
    "rationale": "Key update: While the 12‑month window on FlightsFrom modestly blunts the “6 weeks” argument, the practical constraint is whether airlines have filed additional routes into GDS by July 1. Winter 2025 schedules are often not fully loaded by early July (especially for LCCs), so the window benefit is limited. Charters don’t help unless filed as scheduled. The most plausible Yes paths are: (a) Hong Kong Airlines files HKG–SPN as scheduled service plus at least one additional KR/JP city (beyond GUM, ICN, PUS, NRT), or (b) two secondary KR/JP cities appear. Evidence for HKG is marketing-level, not schedule-confirmed, and Japanese demand remains weak. There’s also downside risk that PUS or NRT isn’t in the schedule window on July 1. Net, I lower my estimate: >4 requires two things to go right (HKG plus one more, or two KR/JP secondaries) with no slippage on existing routes. That stack seems unlikely absent concrete filings visible by July 1.",
