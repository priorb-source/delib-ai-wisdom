  "information": "The most recent post on Virgin Galactic's News page was dated January 30, 2025. The post before that was from December 12, 2024. Over the 10 complete months leading up to May 2025, five months contained at least one post. There was a four-month gap in posts from August to October 2024, and a three-month gap from February to April 2025.\n\nVirgin Galactic announced it will release its financial results for the first quarter of 2025 on Thursday, May 15, 2025, followed by a conference call. The company's Q4 2024 earnings release on February 26, 2025, was not posted on the main News page, nor was the press release announcing the date for the Q1 2025 results. These communications were issued via the Investor Relations section and PR wires.\n\nThe company is in a flight hiatus, with no crewed flights scheduled until 2026. The next generation of spaceplanes, the Delta SpaceShip, began assembly in March 2025. Commercial flights for this new craft are planned to begin in mid-2026, with private astronaut flights following in the fall of 2026. According to a regulatory filing, Geode Capital Management LLC increased its stake in Virgin Galactic by 19.1% during the fourth quarter of 2024.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be definitively known on June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Based on the recent three-month gap in posts from February to April 2025, the status quo is for the company to not post on its News page.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic decides to increase public engagement during its flight hiatus and posts a positive update on the manufacturing progress of its new Delta class ships, or announces a new partnership or executive hire.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The company continues its recent low-communication posture on its main News page, focusing resources on development. The Q1 2025 financial results are released solely through the investor relations portal, consistent with recent practice, and no other newsworthy events occur during May.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards a 'Yes' outcome, primarily driven by the strong evidence of the current status quo. The research indicates that as of late April 2025, Virgin Galactic has not posted on its News page for three consecutive months (February, March, April). This suggests a deliberate low-communication posture during the current flight hiatus. Furthermore, the most predictable news event in May, the Q1 2025 earnings release on May 15, is unlikely to appear on this specific page, as recent financial communications have been confined to investor relations channels. While the company posted news in 5 of the last 10 complete months, establishing a historical 50% base rate, the context has shifted. The company is now deep into a non-operational period focused on future development, reducing the frequency of potential news events like flight announcements. The status quo of no posts is the most powerful single factor. My forecast is not higher than 70% because a month is a significant period, and the company has a clear incentive to maintain public and investor confidence. A surprise announcement regarding a manufacturing milestone for the Delta fleet, a new commercial partnership, or a personnel change is a plausible event that would warrant a news post. My forecast is not lower than 70% because the recent three-month silence, combined with the specific knowledge about how earnings are handled, provides a compelling, evidence-based reason to believe this trend will continue through May. I would increase the probability of 'Yes' if there were reports of development delays. I would decrease it if the company hired a new Chief Communications Officer or if competitors in a similar development phase increased their public announcements.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe most recent post on Virgin Galactic's News page was dated January 30, 2025. The post before that was from December 12, 2024. Over the 10 complete months leading up to May 2025, five months contained at least one post.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
