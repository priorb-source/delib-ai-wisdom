    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I should weigh more heavily. Forecaster 2 raises an excellent point I underappreciated: the 5-year gap between the 2020 Global Compensation Deed and the first payment in 2025 reveals how glacially slow this process has been historically. This is strong evidence against rapid successive payments. Their skepticism about 'reaffirming commitment' as political messaging rather than actionable timeline is also well-founded. Forecaster 3's reasoning closely mirrors mine but emphasizes the status quo bias more heavily. Both forecasters note that the research assistant found NO evidence of imminent payments, which I mentioned but perhaps didn't weight sufficiently. All three of us acknowledge the payment mechanism is now operational as the main factor preventing even lower forecasts. However, I think we're all appropriately skeptical given the extremely short 38-day window and complete absence of information suggesting another payment is planned or imminent. The consensus clustering around 20-32% seems reasonable.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating downward slightly. The 5-year delay between agreement and first payment is more significant than I initially weighted - it suggests institutional inertia and resource constraints that won't disappear in 38 days. The complete absence of any information about imminent second payments from my research assistant is telling. While I maintain that the operational payment mechanism and April 10 reaffirmation represent genuine positive signals, the historical pattern Forecaster 2 identified strengthens the case for status quo (no second payment). Government financial processes in resource-constrained environments typically operate on quarterly or longer timescales, not weekly ones. The small size of the first payment could indicate sequential disbursements are planned, but without evidence of timing, I should assume they follow typical bureaucratic timelines - measured in months, not days. My updated forecast reflects slightly more weight on the historical pattern and information vacuum: 26%.",
