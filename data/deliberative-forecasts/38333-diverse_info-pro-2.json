    "review": "My initial forecast of 15% was in agreement with Forecaster 2, while Forecaster 3 was significantly higher at 30%. All forecasters agree on the key facts: the time remaining is short (26 days) and there is a complete lack of preparatory signals (leaks, paperwork, staff hires). The primary point of divergence is the weight given to the soft signal of an Axios article stating Suarez is 'weighing a bid'. I find Forecaster 3 overweights this, as their own analysis provides several strong arguments for a 'no' outcome. Forecaster 2's reasoning was most convincing and introduced a crucial piece of new information I had not considered: the potential for the Miami City Commission to move the city's election, which would extend Suarez's term and provide a powerful incentive to delay any gubernatorial announcement. This new evidence strongly reinforces my initial lean.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 15% was based on the lack of any logistical groundwork for a campaign launch within the short remaining timeframe. After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast. Forecaster 2's reasoning was particularly compelling, introducing two points that strengthen the case for a 'No' resolution. First, the new information that the Miami City Commission may move the city's election date provides a strong, specific incentive for Suarez to delay any announcement, as it could extend his current term. This lessens the rationale for a rushed entry into the governor's race. Second, the observation that Suarez's low polling numbers (5%) argue for more quiet groundwork before a formal launch, rather than a quick announcement, is a strategically sound point. These arguments diminish the likelihood of a surprise announcement, which was the main reason my forecast was not lower initially. Given these strengthened arguments for a strategic delay, I am reducing my forecast from 15% to 10%.",
