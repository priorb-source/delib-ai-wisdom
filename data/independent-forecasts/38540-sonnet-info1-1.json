  "information": "According to a June 11, 2025 snapshot, Google’s Gemini-2.5-Pro model ranked first on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard with an Elo score of 1478, while OpenAI’s best model was 53 points behind. The competitive landscape in early 2025 has been characterized by a narrowing gap between top models; the Elo score difference between the top-ranked and 10th-ranked model decreased from 11.9% in 2024 to 5.4% in early 2025. Previous leaderboard leaders in 2025 have included Grok-3 by xAI, which held the top spot in February.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 16 days until July 1, 2025, when the question will be resolved",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Google's Gemini-2.5-Pro currently holds the #1 rank on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard as of June 11, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "OpenAI does not release a new competitive model before July 1st, and their existing models fail to gain the 53 Elo points needed to overtake Gemini-2.5-Pro through natural evaluation accumulation. The rankings remain relatively stable through the end of Q2.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "OpenAI releases a powerful new model (such as GPT-5 or a significantly improved variant) in the next two weeks that quickly accumulates evaluations and achieves top ranking, OR their current best model experiences an unexpected surge in Elo score through favorable matchups and evaluations, closing the 53-point gap.",
    "rationale": "The timeframe is critically short - only 16 days until resolution. The research shows OpenAI is currently 53 Elo points behind the leader, which is a substantial deficit to overcome in such a brief period. While the competitive landscape has tightened in 2025 (with the top-10 spread decreasing from 11.9% to 5.4%), and leadership has changed hands multiple times this year (Grok-3 topped in February), these dynamics typically play out over months, not weeks. For OpenAI to reach #1 by July 1st, they would need to either: (1) release a new model immediately and have it accumulate sufficient evaluations to establish a stable high Elo rating within days, or (2) gain 53+ points through natural evaluation drift with their existing model. Both scenarios are challenging given the compressed timeline. The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. However, I'm not assigning an extremely low probability because: the leaderboard has proven dynamic in 2025, the competitive gap has narrowed significantly making position changes more feasible, and OpenAI has the resources to potentially execute a surprise release. My forecast is not higher because 16 days is simply too short for the typical model release, evaluation, and ranking stabilization cycle. It's not lower because the tightened competition means rankings are more fluid than in 2024, and OpenAI remains a leading AI lab with potential unreleased capabilities. I would update higher if evidence emerged of an imminent OpenAI model release, or if their current models showed rapid Elo gains. I would update lower if we moved closer to July 1st without any OpenAI announcements.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill an OpenAI model be ranked #1 overall on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of the 2nd Quarter of 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMethodology: [Chatbot Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating LLMs by Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a model owned by OpenAI is in the number 1 overall rank (ties count) at the [Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this is not the case, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nScroll down to Arena Overview and the resolution is based on the \"overall\" rank.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to a June 11, 2025 snapshot, Google’s Gemini-2.5-Pro model ranked first on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard with an Elo score of 1478, while OpenAI’s best model was 53 points behind. The competitive landscape in early 2025 has been characterized by a narrowing gap between top models; the Elo score difference between the top-ranked and 10th-ranked model decreased from 11.9% in 2024 to 5.4% in early 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
