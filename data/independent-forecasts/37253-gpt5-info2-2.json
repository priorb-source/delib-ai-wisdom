  "information": "In late April 2025, North Korea conducted the first weapons system tests for its new 5,000-ton 'Choe Hyon-class' destroyer. The tests, observed by leader Kim Jong Un, included the launch of supersonic cruise missiles, strategic cruise missiles, and anti-aircraft missiles. The warship is expected to be delivered to the navy and enter service in early 2026. Earlier in 2025, North Korea conducted several other weapons tests. In April, it tested the 'Haeil-2' underwater attack drone. In February, it test-launched strategic cruise missiles. In January, it conducted its first missile test of the year, firing an intermediate-range ballistic missile with a hypersonic glide vehicle.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "North Korea continues frequent missile, UAV/USV, and cruise-missile demonstrations and rhetoric but refrains from detonating a nuclear device. Satellite imagery shows no clear last-mile test preparations at Punggye-ri (e.g., sustained tunneling activity, dewatering, significant vehicle traffic), and there are no credible alerts from South Korean/US/Japanese intelligence or the CTBTO IMS. July 1 arrives without a confirmed nuclear test.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A seventh nuclear test occurs at Punggye-ri (likely Tunnel 3), timed around a political date (e.g., June 25) or as a response to allied exercises/sanctions. The CTBTO’s IMS registers a seismic event consistent with an underground nuclear explosion and governments/major outlets confirm, leading to swift inclusion on Wikipedia’s list of DPRK tests.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates and recent behavior: North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test since September 2017 despite years of speculation (especially 2022–2024) that a seventh test was imminent. With only ~2 months left, the status quo strongly favors no test.\n- Capability vs. decision: Indicators since 2022 suggest Punggye-ri was reconditioned, so a test is technically feasible on short notice. However, Pyongyang has repeatedly chosen missile/cruise/space demonstrations instead of a nuclear detonation, likely balancing signaling value against diplomatic costs (especially with China and Russia, whose tacit tolerance matters). This pattern points to restraint on nuclear testing absent a strong trigger.\n- Recent activity (from research assistant): In 2025 to date, DPRK has tested an IRBM with a hypersonic glide vehicle (Jan), strategic cruise missiles (Feb), the Haeil-2 underwater drone (Apr), and in late April ran the first weapons tests for a new 5,000-ton destroyer, launching supersonic and strategic cruise missiles and AA missiles. These are escalatory in breadth but remain below the threshold of a nuclear detonation; they fit a continued preference for conventional and missile signaling.\n- Timing considerations: Key dates inside the window include June 25 (Korean War outbreak anniversary), which could be used for a dramatic step. That raises risk modestly but not enough to dominate, given many past anniversaries passed without a nuclear test.\nWhy not higher: There are no current public indicators of imminent Punggye-ri activity (e.g., sustained logistics, dewatering), no fresh allied intelligence warnings flagged in open sources, and DPRK has sustained a 7+ year pause despite ample provocations and technical reasons to test. The window is short.\nWhy not lower: DPRK retains the capability and often escalates unpredictably. The regime may seek to validate new warhead designs (e.g., tactical or HGV-compatibility) or leverage a test amid regional tensions. China/Russia may be more tolerant now than in 2017, marginally reducing the external cost of testing.\nWhat would move me up: Clear satellite imagery of last-mile test prep at Punggye-ri; credible government or CTBTO indications of imminent testing; intensified DPRK nuclear rhetoric tied to a specific date; breakdowns or new sanctions that Pyongyang publicly vows to counter with a ‘strategic’ step.\nWhat would move me down: Signals of Chinese pressure discouraging a test; initiation of talks or incentives that offer Pyongyang alternative gains; evidence that recent activity at Punggye-ri is dormant; DPRK opting for other high-profile but non-nuclear actions (e.g., satellite launch) in June.\nOverall, with a short horizon and no current imminent-test indicators, the status quo (No) is favored but not guaranteed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill North Korea test a nuclear weapon before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and in 2017.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting such as the [International Monitoring System’s ](https://www.ctbto.org/our-work/detecting-nuclear-tests) and the sources cited at Wikipedia's [List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn late April 2025, North Korea conducted the first weapons system tests for its new 5,000-ton 'Choe Hyon-class' destroyer.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
