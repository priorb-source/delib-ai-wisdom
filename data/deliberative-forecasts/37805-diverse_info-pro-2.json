    "review": "My initial forecast of 15% was far too low, primarily because I misinterpreted the resolution criteria. I assumed a new flight route would have to be operational by July 1, 2025, a nearly impossible feat in six weeks. Forecaster 2 provided the most critical insight: the source, FlightsFrom.com, lists any route scheduled to operate at any point in the *next 12 months*. This dramatically lowers the barrier, as an airline merely has to announce and file a new route (e.g., for the winter 2025 season) by July 1 for it to count. This point alone warrants a significant update.\n\nFurthermore, Forecaster 2 introduced new evidence I had not considered, specifically that Hong Kong Airlines lists Saipan as a potential destination and that there is elevated search interest from Hong Kong. This provides a concrete candidate for a fifth destination, moving the possibility from abstract to specific. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on the strength of the Korean market, while part of their justification for a higher-than-warranted forecast (given their own reasoning about short timelines), does add weight to the idea that more than one Korean city (e.g., both Seoul and Busan) could be served, reinforcing the base number of routes.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly increasing my forecast from 15% to 40%. The primary driver for this change is the clarification of the resolution criteria provided by Forecaster 2. The fact that a flight only needs to be added to the schedule for any point in the next year—not actually flying—by July 1, 2025, makes a 'Yes' outcome far more plausible. The short six-week timeframe is now for an announcement and schedule filing, not for launching a service.\n\nThe current situation appears to be 3-4 destinations: Guam (GUM), Seoul (ICN), and Busan (PUS) seem relatively stable, with Tokyo (NRT) being promoted by United but historically intermittent. For the question to resolve 'Yes', Saipan needs at least 5 destinations. This means the existing 3-4 routes must be maintained, and at least one new route must be announced and scheduled. \n\nThe evidence for a potential Hong Kong (HKG) route, as noted by Forecaster 2, is a compelling potential '5th' destination. Paired with the strong Korean tourism demand, which could support the existing ICN and PUS routes, the path to five destinations is now visible. My updated 40% forecast reflects the much higher likelihood of a schedule addition within the next six weeks, while still acknowledging that airline route planning is uncertain and that Saipan's tourism sector has faced documented headwinds.",
