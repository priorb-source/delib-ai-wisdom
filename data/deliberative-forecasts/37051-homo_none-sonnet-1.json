    "review": "The three analyses show remarkable convergence on both reasoning and probability (3%, 4%, 3%). All emphasize the same critical constraints: the 67-day timeline, mandatory IRS procedural requirements, Harvard's certain legal challenges, and the absence of evidence that formal proceedings have begun. Forecaster 2 usefully articulates specific update conditions - they would move to 15-25% if formal revocation proceedings were underway, or down to 1-2% with successful preliminary injunctions. Forecaster 3 makes a valuable distinction between presidential rhetoric and implementable administrative action, noting the IRS's traditional operational independence. No forecaster has identified information suggesting actual IRS action has been initiated beyond threats. The consensus strengthens confidence that we've identified the key factors correctly: this would require completing in 67 days a process that typically takes months or years, surviving immediate legal challenges from a well-resourced institution, and overcoming unprecedented procedural barriers. The tight clustering of our independent forecasts (3-4%) suggests this probability range accurately captures both the formidable barriers to a 'Yes' resolution and appropriate tail risk for an unusual political environment.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find no compelling reason to update my forecast. The strong consensus validates the core reasoning: (1) The 67-day timeline is far too compressed for standard IRS revocation procedures, (2) there is no evidence formal proceedings have begun - only threats reported in media, (3) Harvard would immediately seek injunctions that would likely succeed in delaying any rushed action, (4) historical precedent shows major universities essentially never lose 501(c)(3) status, especially on such timelines. All three forecasters independently identified these same barriers using similar logic, which increases confidence in the analysis. The 3-4% range appropriately accounts for tail risk in an unusual political environment where unprecedented actions are theoretically possible, while recognizing that the procedural, legal, and temporal obstacles remain extremely high. I would update significantly higher only if credible reporting emerged showing the IRS had formally initiated revocation proceedings with an explicit expedited timeline, which has not occurred. The current situation remains at the 'threat' stage without concrete administrative action.",
