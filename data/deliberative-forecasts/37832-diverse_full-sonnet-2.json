    "review": "All three forecasters converge on a 14-20% probability range, showing strong agreement on the core factors: the January 2025 funding round reducing urgency, lack of public IPO preparation signals, the CEO's flexible timing approach, and the tight 5-6 week window. Forecaster 3 raises two particularly valuable points I had underweighted: (1) The resolution mechanism concern - announcing IPO plans on a company blog without an accompanying S-1 filing creates securities law 'gun-jumping' risks, making a blog-only announcement highly unlikely. This means the two resolution paths are effectively one path (S-1 filing with possible simultaneous blog post). (2) Summer timing - late June/early July is historically a slower IPO window, and if Databricks targets a fall listing, they could remain confidential through June and file publicly later. Forecaster 2 appropriately emphasizes that the funding included employee liquidity, reducing a key IPO pressure. All forecasters correctly identify the Data + AI Summit as providing some upside possibility but view it as unlikely. The reasoning across all analyses is internally consistent and well-supported.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, the other forecasters' arguments strengthen the case for a slightly lower probability. The gun-jumping concern is particularly compelling - companies rarely announce IPO intentions via blog posts without simultaneous S-1 filings due to SEC regulations. This effectively collapses the two resolution paths into one, centered on a public S-1 filing. The summer timing factor also matters: if Databricks is planning a fall listing, they have no incentive to file publicly in late June rather than remain confidential and file in August/September. Combined with the lack of preparatory signals (no underwriter selection, no leaks, no confidential filing reports), the extremely short 5.5-week window, and the fact that the company just raised massive capital with employee liquidity provisions, the status quo of remaining private through June appears even more likely. The Data + AI Summit provides minimal upside since major IPO announcements through conference keynotes (rather than SEC filings) would be highly unusual. I'm updating slightly downward from 15% to 14% to better reflect these resolution mechanism and timing considerations.",
