    "review": "Both forecasters raise crucial historical evidence I underweighted: Trump didn't grant his first pardon until August 2017 (month 8 of his first term), and didn't exceed 2 people in a single month until well over a year into his presidency. Since June 2025 would be months 5-6 of his second term, this historical timing pattern is quite damning for the Yes case. Forecaster 3's point about clemency being 'lumpy' and clustered around holidays/term endings rather than random mid-year months further strengthens this. However, I note that both forecasters acknowledge second-term dynamics could differ - Trump may be less norm-constrained and has explicitly promised to pardon Jan 6 defendants. The Guardian article reference is ambiguous about whether it indicates recent May 2025 activity or cumulative effects. The threshold remains genuinely low (just 3 people), which both forecasters acknowledge as increasing probability above base rates.",
    "rationale": "I'm revising my forecast downward from 45% to 40% based on the compelling historical timing evidence. The fact that Trump didn't exceed 2 people monthly until well into his first term is a powerful base rate I initially underweighted. June being a non-holiday mid-year month with no special significance also argues against a batch release. However, I'm not going as low as Forecaster 2's 35% because: (1) Second-term presidencies often differ from first terms in risk-taking and norm-breaking; (2) The political pressure regarding Jan 6 defendants is real and Trump has made explicit promises; (3) The threshold is extremely low - just one small symbolic gesture of 3-4 pardons would suffice; (4) We're very close to June (May 29), and the absence of signals could mean either no plans or simply no leaks. I find Forecaster 3's balanced 38% compelling, but maintain slightly higher at 40% given the combination of low threshold and second-term unpredictability.",
