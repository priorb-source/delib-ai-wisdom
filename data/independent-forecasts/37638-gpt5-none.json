    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "47 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The regular session adjourns by late May without passing a bill that fully bans the sale of THC, and the governor does not call a special session on this topic before July 1. Existing arrangements persist: illicit marijuana sales remain illegal, the medical low‑THC program and FDA‑approved THC drugs continue, and hemp-derived product rules may tighten but not amount to a total ban.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A late-breaking bill or a special session measure advances rapidly with language that fully prohibits the sale of THC statewide (sweeping in hemp-derived products and effectively overriding the medical THC program and prescription THC products). The governor includes it on a special session call and signs it into law before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time and process: Texas’ regular session in odd years ends in late May (around May 26). It is already mid-May, and House deadlines for originating bills are largely past. While Senate bills can still move, the window for moving a sweeping, controversial measure through both chambers and conference is very tight. After Sine Die, passage would require a governor-called special session with THC explicitly on the call before July 1.\n- Criteria stringency: The question only resolves Yes if a law fully prohibits the sale of THC statewide. Most realistic Texas proposals target hemp-derived intoxicating cannabinoids (delta-8/delta-9 from hemp) or set age/packaging limits. A true “full prohibition” would also implicate Texas’ Compassionate Use Program (low-THC medical cannabis) and potentially FDA-approved THC medications (e.g., dronabinol). That is far more sweeping than the usual legislative intent and would face significant legal, medical, and political pushback.\n- Politics: The Texas Senate leadership has been more open to cracking down on hemp intoxicants, but the House has repeatedly been a brake. A complete THC sales ban would be an even higher bar. The governor’s recent special-session priorities have focused on border, public safety, property taxes, and school choice rather than hemp/THC. Calling and passing a full THC sales ban by July 1 would be unusually aggressive and politically costly.\n- Status quo inertia: Given the high threshold (full ban), limited time, and cross-pressures (medical program, business interests), the base case is No.\n- Research assistant info: No additional information available; nothing to suggest a live vehicle is near passage.\nWhy not higher: Very limited legislative runway; the requirement is a total ban, not a partial/retail-only restriction; significant political and policy obstacles.\nWhy not lower: Non-zero chance of a surprise late-session amendment or a narrowly tailored bill being interpreted as a full ban (depending on drafting), or an unexpected special session that includes a sweeping THC prohibition.\nSignals to update upward: A bill emerges that explicitly bans sale of THC in all forms passes one chamber and is on the calendar in the other; the governor adds THC ban to a special session call; House leadership signals support for a comprehensive ban. Signals to update downward: Regular session adjourns without such a bill clearing both chambers; public statements from leadership ruling out a comprehensive ban; special session call excludes the topic.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
