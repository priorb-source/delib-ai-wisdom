  "information": "According to multiple news reports from late May 2025, former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo is considered disqualified from the 2025 presidential election. This is due to a 2018 conviction for the looting of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), which resulted in a 20-year prison sentence and the loss of his civic rights. Sources such as Le Point, tunisienumerique.com, and Abidjan.net state that he remains struck from the electoral list. His political party, the People's African Party-Côte d'Ivoire (PPA-CI), announced in late April 2025 that it would evaluate the situation in the first half of June 2025 and consider a 'new level in the fight' if his status on the electoral list does not change.\n\nThe political climate in Côte d'Ivoire is marked by the disqualification of several opposition figures ahead of the October 2025 election. In April 2025, Tidjane Thiam, leader of the main opposition party PDCI-RDA, was disqualified after a court ruled he did not meet eligibility conditions due to his prior dual French-Ivorian nationality, despite having renounced his French citizenship. This and other exclusions have led to protests and accusations of electoral manipulation. Reports also mention that other political figures like Charles Blé Goudé and Guillaume Soro have been excluded from the electoral process due to judicial convictions. In response to the political tensions, various groups, including religious leaders and the UN, have called for peaceful dialogue.\n\nSeveral of the candidates named in the question have officially announced their intention to run in the 2025 presidential election. Jean-Louis Billon, a member of the PDCI-RDA party, announced his candidacy in late May 2025, positioning himself as an alternative within his party following the disqualification of its leader, Tidjane Thiam. Simone Gbagbo, former first lady, has also announced her candidacy under the banner of her party, the Movement of Capable Generations (MGC). Pascal Affi N'Guessan is also presented as a candidate for the FPI party.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Laurent Gbagbo appears to already be disqualified",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "All five candidates (Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, and Simone Gbagbo) remain eligible to run or successfully appeal any disqualifications through July 1, 2025. This would require either Laurent Gbagbo's reinstatement to the electoral list or confirmation that he was never formally removed from it for the 2025 election cycle.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Laurent Gbagbo's current disqualification status is confirmed as a formal removal from the electoral list that occurred before July 1, 2025. Alternatively, one or more of the other four candidates faces legal challenges resulting in disqualification in the next month, following the pattern of opposition exclusions seen with Tidjane Thiam and others.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report indicates that Laurent Gbagbo is already considered disqualified as of late May 2025 due to a 2018 conviction resulting in loss of civic rights, and he 'remains struck from the electoral list.' This is the critical factor. If this disqualification status is formally recognized as occurring before July 1, 2025, the question resolves as Yes. The timing is crucial - his party PPA-CI plans to evaluate the situation in early June and may escalate their fight if his status doesn't change, suggesting they view him as currently disqualified but hoping for reversal. The political context supports high probability: Côte d'Ivoire has seen multiple opposition disqualifications (Tidjane Thiam in April 2025, plus Charles Blé Goudé and Guillaume Soro), creating a pattern of electoral exclusions amid accusations of manipulation. The other four candidates (Jean-Louis Billon, Simone Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, and Gnangbo Kacou) show no immediate disqualification risks based on available information - three have announced candidacies without reported legal obstacles. However, the volatile political climate means additional disqualifications remain possible in the 32 days remaining. My forecast is not higher (95%+) because there's uncertainty about whether Gbagbo's status constitutes a formal 'removal from the electoral list' for 2025 specifically, versus an ongoing ineligibility from 2018. It's not lower because the evidence strongly suggests at least one candidate (Gbagbo) is already in a disqualified state. I would revise upward with formal confirmation of Gbagbo's disqualification timing or news of other candidates facing legal challenges. I would revise downward if Gbagbo successfully appeals or evidence emerges that his 2018 conviction doesn't apply to the 2025 electoral list.",
