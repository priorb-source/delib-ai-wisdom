  "information": "On April 5, 2025, demonstrations under the \"Hands Off!\" campaign occurred across all 50 U.S. states and in several international cities. A coalition of over 150 groups, including Indivisible and MoveOn, organized the events in response to administration policies such as federal layoffs, rising tariffs, and civil rights rollbacks. Participation estimates varied: one report cited over 1,400 events with nearly 600,000 attendees, while another stated over 600,000 people participated in more than 1,200 rallies. Solidarity protests were also held in cities like Berlin, London, and Paris.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker does not report any U.S. protests with 10,000+ participants before July 1, 2025. This could occur if the April 5 'Hands Off!' protests, despite their large total participation (~600,000), were distributed across 1,200-1,400 events such that no single location reached 10,000 participants. Alternatively, the tracker may not document these protests in time, or may use different participation estimates that fall below the threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker reports at least one U.S. protest with 10,000+ participants. Most likely, this occurs through documentation of the April 5, 2025 protests, where major cities like Washington D.C., New York, or Los Angeles had individual gatherings exceeding 10,000 participants. Alternatively, additional large-scale protests occur in the remaining two months before July 1, driven by the ongoing political tensions around federal policies, civil rights, and economic issues.",
    "rationale": "The April 5, 2025 'Hands Off!' protests represent strong evidence for a Yes resolution. With ~600,000 total participants across 1,200-1,400 events nationwide, the average per-event attendance was 428-500 people. However, protest participation is rarely evenly distributed. Major U.S. protests typically concentrate in large metropolitan areas, particularly Washington D.C., New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago. Historical precedent suggests that coordinated national protests often feature flagship events in these cities with tens of thousands of participants, even when the national average is much lower. The mobilization infrastructure demonstrated by the coalition of 150+ organizations, combined with protests spanning all 50 states and international solidarity events, indicates sophisticated organizing capacity. The triggering issues (federal layoffs, tariffs, civil rights rollbacks) are substantive policy concerns likely to sustain mobilization. Critical uncertainties include: (1) whether any single April 5 location actually reached 10,000 participants, (2) whether the Global Protest Tracker has documented or will document these events before July 1, and (3) the possibility of additional large protests in the two months remaining. The forecast is not higher because the distributed nature of the protests creates uncertainty about individual event sizes, and we lack confirmation that the tracker has recorded these events. The forecast is not lower because large coordinated U.S. protests typically do produce individual events exceeding 10,000 participants, two months provides adequate time for either documentation or new protests, and the current political environment supports continued mobilization. I would update higher with confirmation that at least one April 5 protest location had 10,000+ participants or with news of planned large-scale protests. I would update lower if detailed reporting confirms no single location reached 10,000 or if the tracker's methodology excludes these events.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in the United States with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBrookings Institution: [The power of protest in the US](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-power-of-protest-in-the-us/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in the United States with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn April 5, 2025, demonstrations under the \"Hands Off!\" campaign occurred across all 50 U.S. states and in several international cities.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
