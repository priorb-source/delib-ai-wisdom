    "review": "All three forecasters independently arrived at similar conclusions (30-40% range), which validates the overall reasoning approach. We all identified the same key factors: historical male dominance in this category, recent positive trends toward gender equity at James Beard Awards, the Foundation's active diversity efforts, and critically, the lack of specific information about the 2025 finalists. Forecaster 2 provided a useful datapoint suggesting 30-40% of recent Outstanding Chef finalists have been women, which helps ground the estimate. Forecaster 3 appropriately emphasized that finalists are already fixed, so this is purely about selection from a known pool we cannot see. None of the forecasters introduced fundamentally new evidence or arguments that I hadn't considered, but the convergence of independent estimates in the 30-40% range provides useful calibration. The slight spread (30%, 35%, 40%) reflects reasonable disagreement about how much weight to give recent positive trends versus historical base rates.",
    "rationale": "The consensus among all three forecasters falling in the 30-40% range provides validation that this is a reasonable estimate given available information. However, I was at the higher end (40%) while the others were more conservative (35% and 30%). Upon reflection, without access to the specific finalist composition, being slightly more conservative is warranted. The middle ground of the range (around 35-37%) better balances the competing factors: (1) historical male dominance in the category suggests probability below 50%, (2) recent winners like Mashama Bailey (2022) and positive industry trends suggest meaningful probability above historical base rates, (3) James Beard Foundation's diversity efforts support upward adjustment, but (4) the persistent gender imbalance in elite culinary positions and our complete lack of information about the actual 2025 finalists argues for caution. I'm adjusting downward slightly to 37% to reflect a more moderate position within the consensus range, acknowledging that my initial 40% may have been slightly optimistic given the uncertainty.",
