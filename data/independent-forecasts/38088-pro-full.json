  "information": "As of April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy. As of May 29, 2025, the position was occupied by Vladimir Potanin of Russia.\n\nAnalysis of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index indicates several distribution patterns. U.S. representation is strongest in the top tiers but diminishes at lower rankings. In the 200-300 range, approximately 62% of positions are occupied by non-U.S. billionaires. Over the past year, overall U.S. representation in the top 500 has reportedly declined from 40% to around 35%. Some analyses suggest a seasonal variability, with U.S. billionaires showing stronger representation in the fourth quarter and weaker representation in the first and second quarters.\n\nIn late May 2025, several economic developments were reported. The US Consumer Confidence Index rebounded to a four-year high in May after falling to a five-year low the previous month, an improvement attributed to the temporary suspension of tariffs. US stock indexes, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, rose in anticipation of major tech earnings reports. The EU was given until July 9 to reach a trade deal with the US, a delay that experts considered a positive market signal. A prior 90-day delay in raising import tariffs led to a record $304 billion increase in the combined wealth of the world's richest people, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, as the resolution date is on or after July 1, 2025, and today's date is May 29, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of May 29, 2025, the 250th-ranked person is Vladimir Potanin of Russia.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Global markets continue their current trends, or international markets slightly outperform US markets through June. The general distribution of wealth, where non-US billionaires hold a majority of positions in the 200-300 rank range, persists. Consequently, on July 1, 2025, the 250th position is occupied by a billionaire from Europe, Asia, or another non-US region.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Positive US economic sentiment, driven by the rebound in consumer confidence and delayed tariffs, fuels a significant rally in US stock indices during June. This disproportionately benefits US-based billionaires, particularly in the tech sector, causing several to see their wealth increase enough to push a US national into the 250th spot by the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the structural distribution of wealth on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index and the current status quo. The strongest evidence pointing to a 'No' outcome is the current data: as of today, the 250th position is held by a Russian citizen, and historically, approximately 62% of the positions in the 200-300 rank range are occupied by non-U.S. billionaires. This establishes a strong base rate against a 'Yes' outcome. Furthermore, the overall trend over the past year shows a decline in US representation in the top 500, from 40% to 35%, which reinforces the 'No' case.\n\nHowever, I am not forecasting a lower probability because there are significant short-term factors that could favor a 'Yes' outcome. The recent rebound in the US Consumer Confidence Index to a four-year high and the positive market reaction to delayed tariffs on EU imports could drive a US market rally in the coming month. A previous tariff delay led to a substantial increase in billionaire wealth, and a similar event could elevate a US billionaire, currently ranked just below 250, into the median position. The inherent volatility of wealth rankings at this level means that relatively small market shifts can result in significant positional changes.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the structural data (the 62% non-US majority in this range) and the longer-term trend of declining US representation are more powerful indicators than short-term market sentiment. While a US rally is possible, overcoming the existing distribution in just one month is not the most likely scenario. The status quo is a non-US individual, and in forecasting, the status quo carries significant weight over short time horizons.\n\nI would increase my probability forecast if there were specific news of a major breakthrough in the US-EU trade deal or if US tech stocks began to radically outperform global peers. Conversely, I would decrease the probability if international markets, particularly in China or Europe, showed unexpected strength, or if US markets stumbled.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked name on the list was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
