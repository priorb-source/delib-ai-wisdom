    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short horizon, low leverage reducing creditor-forced timing, and the plausibility of out-of-court wind-down versus immediate filing. New to me was the explicit focus on near-term catalysts like the Q1 10-Q deadline/auditor issues as triggers, and the point that bankruptcy costs themselves can delay filing. I find their reasoning coherent: distress is severe, but the short runway and low debt argue against >50% odds before July. Their mentions of Chapter 7 as a realistic path if caretaker/public-company costs can’t be met in June are persuasive.",
    "rationale": "a) Time left: ~8 weeks (to July 1, 2025).\nb) Status quo outcome if nothing changes: No filing by July 1 (they’ve persisted into May without a petition).\nc) No outcome scenario: They continue a bare-bones shell, stretch payables, pursue out-of-court alternatives (asset sale/ABC/dissolution), or secure a small bridge/LOI that extends runway beyond July without court protection.\nd) Yes outcome scenario: Cash runs out for June obligations (audit/10-Q, insurance, lease/security, legal); board opts for Chapter 7 to orderly wind down, or a creditor action/default precipitates a quick in-court process.\n\nUpdated reasoning: The company’s liquidity is critically low, operations are shuttered, and capital raises have failed—classic precursors to bankruptcy. However, very low financial debt reduces immediate creditor pressure and allows out-of-court wind-down or delay. The short window tilts toward No by inertia. That said, I’m nudging up due to near-term reporting/compliance costs (10-Q in May) and caretaker expenses that could force a decision in June, plus the absence of operating inflows. I still weight non-bankruptcy paths and delay as the base case, but see a substantial risk of a Chapter 7 before July if they cannot fund filings/audit or an asset sale falls through.\n\nChange: Up from 30% to 35%, reflecting the added catalyst risk around the Q1 10-Q/audit and June cash needs within the remaining short horizon.",
