  "information": "Following the March 2025 Greenlandic parliamentary elections, the Demokraatit party, which advocates for a gradual path to independence, emerged as the winner. The new Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, favors incremental autonomy and has emphasized economic development. While the more staunchly pro-independence Naleraq party doubled its number of parliamentary seats, it remains in the opposition. The government has initiated some formal steps, including the presentation of a draft constitution in May 2023 and the formation of a commission under the Self-Government Act to handle independence negotiations; this commission has been given a multi-year mandate.\n\nPublic sentiment in Greenland shows strong support for the principle of independence, with various polls indicating approval from over 80% of the population. However, opinions on the timing vary, with many favoring a more gradual approach. A January 2025 survey revealed that while 84% support independence, 45% of supporters would reconsider if it meant a decline in living standards. The debate over independence has been recently intensified by comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump about acquiring the island, which also prompted a solidarity visit from Danish King Frederik X in late April 2025 and a visit from a U.S. private sector delegation exploring investment opportunities.\n\nGreenland's economy is substantially dependent on an annual block grant from Denmark, which amounts to approximately 4.3 billion Danish kroner and makes up about half of the government's budget. The current government's stated priority is to develop Greenland's mineral resources to build economic self-sufficiency before moving toward political independence. The 2009 Self-Government Act provides the legal basis for Greenland to declare independence through a referendum. Past referendums, such as those in 1979 and 2008, had significantly longer preparation and lead times than the period before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Demokraatit-led government keeps its gradualist stance, focuses on economic measures and the multi‑year independence commission, and does not table or pass a referendum law nor issue a government decree setting a date. Parliament’s agenda fills with other priorities and July 1 arrives without an official scheduling announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "To satisfy pro-independence sentiment or secure parliamentary support on unrelated legislation, the government (Naalakkersuisut) or a parliamentary majority rapidly advances and approves a measure that officially sets a referendum date—potentially years in the future—or announces an advisory independence referendum date by executive decision. The announcement is made by an authorized Greenlandic authority before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and political incentives: The new government under Jens‑Frederik Nielsen (Demokraatit) favors a gradual path and has emphasized economic development and self‑sufficiency first. This makes a near‑term scheduling unlikely, especially within two months. Naleraq’s gains increase pressure but they remain in opposition. Governments prioritizing gradualism rarely lock in a referendum date quickly because it limits flexibility and creates expectations. \n- Institutional/procedural friction: Even if the Self‑Government Act allows an independence referendum, formally scheduling typically requires a parliamentary act or a government decision with legal force. Drafting the question, legal basis, and administrative planning generally take time. Past Greenland referendums (1979, 2008) had long lead times, suggesting a low base rate for rapid scheduling. While a date could, in theory, be set far in the future, doing so still entails political cost and process. \n- Public opinion and constraints: Support for independence is high in principle (≈80%+), but conditional—many would reconsider if living standards fall. Greenland’s budget depends heavily on Denmark’s block grant (~4.3bn DKK, about half the budget). The government’s stated priority is building economic capacity (e.g., minerals) before independence, aligning with not rushing a date. \n- Recent context: The election result labeled as a win for “independence gradualists,” the multi‑year commission mandate, and the lack (so far) of concrete legislative steps toward a referendum date point to inertia over the next 60 days. Heightened attention (e.g., Trump comments, royal visit, U.S. business interest) raises salience but does not by itself create a procedural path to an imminent scheduling. \nWhy not higher: Very little time remains; the governing party’s stance and institutional lead times make a quick official scheduling improbable. No reporting of a referendum bill or coalition pledge to schedule imminently. \nWhy not lower: A low‑probability path exists: the government could announce a distant or advisory referendum date to placate pro‑independence constituencies, or as part of a tactical deal in the new parliament. If the executive has authority to set consultative referendum dates, this could be done relatively quickly. \nWhat would move me up: Public release of the government platform or a coalition/legislative agreement promising to set a date this spring; tabling of a referendum bill; placement of a referendum scheduling item on the Inatsisartut agenda; authoritative statements by the PM or Naalakkersuisut indicating intent to name a date before summer. \nWhat would move me down: Clear government statements ruling out scheduling this year; the parliamentary calendar filling up or adjourning without any referendum item; signs the commission timetable explicitly defers any scheduling decision beyond 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing the March 2025 Greenlandic parliamentary elections, the Demokraatit party, which advocates for a gradual path to independence, emerged as the winner.
