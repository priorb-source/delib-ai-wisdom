  "information": "Broader geopolitical factors include Japan's decision to undertake its largest military expansion since World War II, with the goal of doubling its defense budget by 2027, partly in response to the perceived Chinese threat to Taiwan. The U.S. and Japan have conducted joint military exercises on Japanese islands near Taiwan. Economically, a report in The Economist suggested the U.S.-China trade war could influence events, though some scholars believe China's internal economic situation makes military action less likely. The Council on Foreign Relations has assessed a security crisis in the Taiwan Strait as 'moderately likely' in 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "PLA continues air and naval coercion, gray-zone actions, and possibly a tighter quasi-blockade or Coast Guard pressure around Kinmen/Matsu/Pratas, but no PLA ground troops land on Taiwan-controlled territory; the US criticizes coercion without using “invasion” language.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A PLA marine/army unit lands and seizes a Taiwan-administered island (e.g., Pratas/Dongsha or a Kinmen/Matsu islet), and the White House/State/DoD publicly states that China has invaded Taiwan by inserting ground forces without Taipei’s consent.",
    "rationale": "Baseline inertia strongly favors no PLA ground incursion in the next ~8 weeks. A cross-strait ground landing—even a limited seizure of an offshore islet—would be a sharp escalation with high military and geopolitical risks for Beijing and would likely be preceded by observable mobilization (amphibious units marshaling, large civilian vessel requisitions, coastal closures, logistics staging). There are no widely reported indicators at that scale as of May 5, 2025. Even if a broader “security crisis” is moderately likely in 2025 (per CFR), the subset event here is far narrower: it requires both (1) PLA ground forces entering Taiwan-controlled territory and (2) the US government publicly accusing China of an invasion on those grounds. Many plausible escalations—air/missile strikes, blockade, Coast Guard or maritime militia actions, ADIZ pressure—would not meet the criterion. Moreover, Washington may avoid the specific term “invasion” given sensitivities of the One China policy, especially for limited or ambiguous incidents. The assistant’s research mentioning Japan’s defense buildup and US-Japan exercises supports deterrence and suggests that while tensions are elevated, the cost calculus for a sudden ground move remains steep. China’s economic headwinds cut both ways in theory but, near-term, favor caution rather than a rushed amphibious action. Why not higher: The two-month window is short, the act is extreme, and wording requirements are specific. Why not lower: A non-zero tail risk exists that Beijing could attempt a fait accompli on an outlying feature (Pratas or a small Kinmen/Matsu islet) using marines; in such a case, US officials might choose explicit “invasion” language to deter further escalation. What would move me up: Credible reports of PLA amphibious mobilization (satellite imagery of staging, port activity with RO-RO requisitions, announced/executed large-scale East China Sea closures), evacuation orders or unusual civil defense moves in Fujian/Guangdong, PRC political signaling prepping domestic audiences for conflict, or an armed clash around outlying islands. What would move me down: Sustained de-escalatory diplomacy (e.g., high-level US-China/Taiwan strait messaging), resumption/expansion of mil-mil confidence measures, visible stand-down of PLA activities, or simply getting to mid-late June without mobilization indicators.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCFR: [Why China-Taiwan Relations Are So Tense](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-taiwan-relations-tension-us-policy-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
