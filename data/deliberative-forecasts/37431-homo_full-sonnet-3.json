    "review": "All three forecasts converged remarkably on 40-45%, suggesting strong agreement on fundamentals. Forecaster 2 makes a compelling mathematical point: if approximately 50% of comparable recalls close within 70 days, then 68 days should yield a probability close to but slightly below 50%. This is more precise reasoning than my initial approach. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the 17-month production window (November 2023 to April 2025) and the verification challenges with frozen products persisting in consumer freezers is well-articulated and reinforces concerns about timely closure. Both forecasters appropriately applied status quo bias given only 11 days have elapsed. The key tension is between the statistical median (suggesting ~50%) and the specific negative factors of this recall (frozen products, extended production period, Class I classification) that could push it below average.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I weighted the negative factors too heavily relative to the statistical baseline. If 50% of comparable recalls close within 70 days, starting at 40% for a 68-day window requires strong justification. The frozen product nature and 17-month production window are genuinely concerning, but the limited geographic scope (NY only) is a significant positive factor that may offset some delays. The allergen/misbranding classification and voluntary proactive recall also favor efficiency. While I maintain that 68 days is at the lower end of the typical range and frozen products create real verification challenges, the mathematical argument about proximity to the 70-day median is sound. I'm updating moderately upward to better reflect that we're near the median closure time, while still acknowledging the specific factors that suggest this recall may take longer than average.",
