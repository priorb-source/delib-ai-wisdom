    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize multiple independent pathways to Yes (scandal-driven exits, cabinet appointments, baseline churn). Forecaster 3 adds a useful caution about the window excluding June 5–9 and pegs the baseline to 40–50%, which likely improves on my earlier, slightly high baseline. Forecaster 2’s framing that a No requires all triggers to fail is directionally right, though the triggers aren’t independent, so it can overstate the combined probability. Both are right to flag the June 16–19 plenary as a focal point and that Qatargate shows some indicted MEPs resist resigning for months. Neither provided concrete, new names or firm timelines for cabinet appointments; thus the uplift from national-government formation remains probabilistic rather than confirmed. Overall, their reasoning nudges me modestly upward, but I remain below their 70–72% due to stickiness in resignation behavior (vs. suspending party membership or stepping down from committee posts) and the tight 21-day window.",
    "rationale": "Updated view: \n- Baseline: Using historical replacements (80–120 over five years) but recognizing clustering earlier in the term and that many replacements are not pure resignations, a 21-day baseline of ~40–50% for at least one resignation seems reasonable.\n- Scandal channel: Arrest of Martusciello and pending immunity waivers for others, plus zero-tolerance postures and a mid-June plenary vote, create a real catalyst. However, Qatargate shows MEPs often resist resigning quickly; many first relinquish roles rather than the seat. That tempers the scandal-driven probability within this narrow window.\n- Government appointments: Portugal presents the most plausible near-term source of resignations, but specifics (names, swearing-in dates) aren’t confirmed. Timing risk remains; announcements could slip into July or appointees may not be MEPs.\n- Net: Combining a ~45% baseline with moderate, partly correlated boosts from scandal and possible cabinet appointments supports mid-to-high 60s rather than 70s. The June 16–19 plenary is the key pivot; if immunity is lifted and parties apply pressure, an announcement could follow promptly and satisfy the resolution (announcement in-window even if effective later). Absent fresh, concrete signals, I avoid >70%.\n- Triggers to move: Up on confirmed cabinet lists including MEPs with late-June swearing-in or clear party ultimatums tied to immunity votes. Down if JURI/plenary timing slips or implicated MEPs receive backing to stay on, or if Portugal’s cabinet formation timeline pushes to July.",
