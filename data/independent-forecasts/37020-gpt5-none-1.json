    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 16 days (until May 8, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — given four nominations and at least one massively impactful collaboration, the base case is that he wins at least one award.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ACM voters coalesce around core country acts (e.g., Lainey Wilson, Luke Combs, Chris Stapleton, Jelly Roll), and Post Malone’s entries finish runner‑up in tightly contested categories; “I Had Some Help” loses Single/Music Event to a more traditional pick, and any video/song categories break against him, resulting in a shutout.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He converts one of his four nominations, most plausibly via “I Had Some Help” (with Morgan Wallen) in Music Event or Single of the Year, or a visual/media category, where its commercial dominance and cultural footprint carry the vote.",
    "rationale": "Timing: We’re ~2 weeks out; ballots are likely set or nearly so, limiting new information. Base rates: With four nominations and roughly five nominees per category, an equal‑strength, independence naïve model gives 1 − (4/5)^4 ≈ 59% for at least one win. Realistically, outcomes are correlated: either voters embrace or resist the crossover, increasing variance and slightly lowering the naïve at‑least‑one probability. Countering that, “I Had Some Help” was a blockbuster country hit in the eligibility window, which likely makes at least one category a near‑favorite rather than a pure coin flip. Netting these, I place the probability modestly above the naïve 59%.\nEvidence/intuition: ACMs have shown willingness to reward high‑impact collaborations and big singles, even with pop crossovers, when they dominate the year. Post Malone’s four nominations signal broad industry recognition, not a fringe nod. The Morgan Wallen pairing boosts competitiveness in categories like Music Event or Single. Reasons against: Some ACM voting blocs may favor traditional artists; competition from perennial winners (Stapleton, Wilson, Combs, Jelly Roll) is fierce; and correlation risk means a love‑it or leave‑it outcome could produce a shutout.\nWhy not higher: Correlated outcomes and strong rivals could block him in all four categories. Why not lower: Multiple shots plus at least one likely strong category (especially Music Event/Single) push the chance above 50%.\nUpdates that would move me up: Credible odds/industry chatter naming his entries as category favorites; final ballot leaks; pre‑telecast winners showing momentum toward collaborations; confirmation that his nominations include categories where the field is weaker. Updates that would move me down: Strong consensus forecasts favoring rivals in his specific categories; signs of a traditionalist tilt in early announced winners; indication that his four nominations cluster in especially competitive fields.\nResearch assistant input: None beyond confirmation of timing and four nominations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Post Malone win an award at the 60th Academy of Country Music Awards?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe awards are scheduled to be held on May 8, 2025. Malone has 4 nominations.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Post Malone wins an award at the [60th Academy of Country Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_Academy_of_Country_Music_Awards).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
