  "information": "Polling data from key regions indicates specific strengths for each party. In Quebec, the Liberal Party holds a lead with 40% support, compared to 25% for the Conservatives. The Liberals also maintain a lead in Ontario. In contrast, the Conservatives lead in the western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. In British Columbia, the race is reported to be tied, with both parties at 42% support.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months. The election must be held on or before October 20, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Based on current polling, the Liberal Party's leads in Canada's two most populous provinces, Ontario and Quebec, would allow them to win the national popular vote.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Liberal Party maintains its polling advantage in Ontario and Quebec. Despite the Conservative Party's strong performance in the western provinces, the population density of central Canada secures the national popular vote for the Liberals.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative campaign successfully sways undecided voters in Ontario by focusing on economic issues like inflation and housing. This erodes the Liberal lead in Ontario, which, combined with strong results in Western Canada, is enough to secure a plurality of the national popular vote.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the provided polling data, which indicates a significant structural advantage for the Liberal Party in winning the national popular vote. Their leads in Ontario and Quebec, which contain a majority of the Canadian electorate, create a high barrier for the Conservatives to overcome. The Conservative strongholds in Alberta and Saskatchewan are less populous, meaning their large victory margins there are often insufficient to win the overall popular vote. Given these facts, the status quo outcome is 'No'.\n\nHowever, I am forecasting a 35% probability, not a lower figure, because with approximately six months until the election, there is ample time for public sentiment to shift. The Conservative party could capitalize on economic discontent, or the governing Liberals could commit a significant unforced error. A tightening of the race in Ontario is plausible and would dramatically increase the Conservatives' chances.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because overcoming the current Liberal leads in both Ontario and Quebec simultaneously is a difficult task. The Conservatives have a clear but narrow path to winning the popular vote, which relies heavily on flipping voter intention in populous central Canada, where they are currently trailing.\n\nI would increase my probability for 'Yes' if future polling showed the gap in Ontario closing to within the margin of error. Conversely, I would decrease the probability if the Liberal lead in Ontario or British Columbia widened.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
