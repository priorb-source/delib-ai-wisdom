    "review": "All three forecasters converged on the 60-65% range, identifying December 2024's 6 cube-shaped sightings as the pivotal data point. Forecaster 2 and I both landed at 65%, while Forecaster 3 chose 60%. The key new information raised includes: (1) the ~300 reports/month baseline calculation at NUFORC, (2) June's seasonal increase in outdoor activity potentially boosting sightings, and (3) Forecaster 3's 1-2% estimate for cube-shaped reports. However, I find the 1-2% estimate problematic - if applied consistently to 300 monthly reports, it would yield 3-6 cube reports per month, contradicting the 'rare' designation. The 'rare' label strongly suggests most months have zero cube-shaped sightings, making December's 6 an outlier rather than typical. The critical uncertainty remains: how frequently do months contain at least one cube-shaped sighting? The word 'rare' suggests infrequency, but December's recent occurrence with 6 reports (not just 1) provides meaningful evidence that these reports do happen. No forecaster presented evidence about January-May 2025, which would be highly informative.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain my 65% forecast. The convergence around 60-65% suggests our collective assessment is well-calibrated. The new arguments don't fundamentally change my analysis: (1) The ~300 reports/month calculation confirms an active reporting system but doesn't tell us about cube-shape frequency; (2) The seasonal factor for June is a modest positive but unlikely to be decisive; (3) The 1-2% estimate appears inconsistent with the 'rare' designation when properly calculated. The core logic remains: December 2024's 6 cube-shaped sightings occurred recently and robustly exceeded the threshold of 1, we only need a single report for resolution, NUFORC remains operational, and the UAP reporting environment is active. The 'rare' designation prevents a higher forecast (75%+), but the recent empirical evidence and low bar prevent a lower forecast (50% or below). The 5% spread between Forecaster 3 (60%) and myself/Forecaster 2 (65%) represents reasonable uncertainty about whether December was moderately unusual or highly unusual. I lean toward 65% because December's 6 reports suggest a non-negligible baseline probability of at least one occurrence.",
