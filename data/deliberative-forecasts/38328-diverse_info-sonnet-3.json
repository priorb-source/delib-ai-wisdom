    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises crucial information I underweighted: the Huawei scandal has already led to one MEP's arrest (Fulvio Martusciello) and immunity waiver requests for four others, with votes scheduled during the June 16-19 plenary - a concrete catalyst within our window. The Qatargate precedent showing political groups enforce 'zero-tolerance' is compelling. However, 70% seems too high given that even in Qatargate, many MEPs resisted resigning for months. Forecaster 3's base-rate approach (80-120 replacements per 5-year term ≈ 1.3-2.0/month) provides valuable quantitative grounding and their 60% forecast appropriately balances scandal effects against historical resistance to quick resignations. Both forecasters correctly identify mechanisms I underweighted: the scandal pathway with specific parliamentary procedures, and the early-term effect. The June 16-19 plenary is particularly important as it falls squarely in our window and could generate immediate pressure.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating upward from 40% to 52% for three reasons: (1) I significantly underweighted the Huawei scandal mechanism - with one arrest and four immunity waiver requests being voted on June 16-19, there's a concrete parliamentary process that could generate immediate resignation pressure within our window; (2) The base rate data suggests ~1.5-2.0 resignations per month, higher than I implicitly assumed, though I'm skeptical this distributes evenly; (3) I now see multiple independent pathways: Portugal government formation (my original focus), the scandal/plenary mechanism (Forecasters 2 & 3's focus), and other national political shifts. However, I'm not going as high as 60-70% because: historical precedent shows MEPs often resist resigning even under scandal pressure (Qatargate took months to unfold); the 22-day window remains very constrained for timing precision; and the base rate itself may not be evenly distributed across time. The combination of scandal + plenary timing + government formations justifies moving from 40% to the low-50s range, but the short window and historical resistance patterns prevent me from going higher.",
