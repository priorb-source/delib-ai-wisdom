    "review": "All three analyses converge on the key structural factors: ~6-7 weeks remaining, likely one FOMC meeting in mid-June, the Fed recently paused after cutting, and strong status quo bias in central bank behavior. Forecaster 3 and I both independently arrived at 25%, while Forecaster 2 is at 35%. The main difference is that Forecaster 2 places more weight on the Fed's recent willingness to cut rates (showing they're in 'easing mode') as evidence they might cut again soon. This is a fair point - the Fed being in a recent cutting cycle could lower the bar for another cut compared to if they had been on hold for an extended period. However, I think this somewhat underweights the significance of the 'pause' decision itself. When the Fed explicitly pauses after cutting, this is typically a deliberate signal that they believe policy is appropriately positioned and they want to assess the lagged effects. The pause represents the most recent policy signal and should carry substantial weight. Forecaster 3's analysis aligns closely with mine on emphasizing that the Fed rarely makes abrupt reversals within 6-week windows without significant economic developments, and that the pause signals satisfaction with current policy stance.",
    "rationale": "After considering the other forecasters' analyses, I find strong validation in the convergence on key factors and the identical 25% forecast from Forecaster 3. Forecaster 2's higher forecast of 35% is defensible but requires believing the Fed's recent cutting cycle outweighs the more recent pause signal. I believe the pause is the dominant signal here. The Fed is deliberate, data-dependent, and typically maintains a policy stance for multiple meetings when they explicitly signal a pause. For them to cut in the single June meeting would require deteriorating conditions that we have no current evidence of as of mid-May. The 6.5-week window is simply too short for the Fed to observe sustained trends that would justify reversing their just-announced pause. While I acknowledge the non-zero probability due to potential unexpected shocks or rapid data deterioration, the status quo heavily favors no cut. The fact that two of three forecasters independently arrived at 25% provides additional confidence in this assessment. I see no compelling reason to update my forecast.",
