  "information": "Specific industries and markets have shown negative reactions to the economic climate. Moody's Ratings downgraded the retail industry's outlook to 'negative' due to 'bleak' prospects amid the ongoing trade war, predicting that tariffs will harm profitability and raise consumer prices. In response to tariffs, Volkswagen has implemented an 'import surcharge', and companies like Temu, Shein, and Hermès announced price increases. The financial markets have also been volatile, with the S&P 500 Index falling significantly after the tariff announcement. Separately, the U.S. beef industry has expressed concern that poor consumer sentiment could negatively impact demand.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–3 weeks (preliminary May 2025 reading likely released around Fri, May 9–10, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "A slight rebound from an extremely depressed April level, yielding a May reading just above 50.8 (i.e., Yes).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Further risk-off news in late April/early May (equity selloff, higher gasoline prices, weak jobs report, fresh tariff escalations or price-hike headlines) pushes sentiment down or keeps it at/below 50.8.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Stabilization or mild improvement in markets, no new negative tariff shocks, and steady gas prices lead to a modest mean-reversion bounce above 50.8.",
    "rationale": "The April print (50.8) is the second-lowest on record, an extreme level that historically tends to be followed by some mean reversion absent new shocks. Because the bar for a Yes is very low (any uptick above 50.8), even a modest bounce would suffice. The preliminary May release (which resolves the question) arrives early in the month, limiting exposure to later data (e.g., mid-May CPI). Key near-term drivers before the prelim are the early-May jobs report, equity market tone, and fuel prices. The research assistant notes multiple headwinds—retail outlook downgrade, tariff-related price increases, and market volatility—all of which plausibly contributed to April’s plunge. Those negatives could persist, but much of that shock may already be embedded in the April reading. Why not higher: Ongoing tariff headlines, potential market weakness, elevated inflation expectations, and a soft jobs print could easily keep or push the index at/under 50.8. Why not lower: Given the extraordinary low base, modest stabilization in markets and news flow often yields a small bounce. What would move me up: A resilient early-May jobs report, equity stabilization/rally into the release, flat-to-lower gas prices, and fewer negative pricing headlines. What would move me down: Fresh tariff escalations or retaliations, renewed market selloff, a weak jobs report, or visible gas price increases into the survey window.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSpecific industries and markets have shown negative reactions to the economic climate.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
