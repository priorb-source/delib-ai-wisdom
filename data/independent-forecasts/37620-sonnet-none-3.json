    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days, until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Kadyrov remains Head of the Chechen Republic",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Kadyrov's May 6 statement about wanting to step down does not materialize into actual resignation before June 1. His statement proves to be political rhetoric, or the transition process requires Kremlin coordination that extends beyond the deadline, or he simply delays the decision.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kadyrov follows through quickly on his stated desire to step down, possibly due to health issues or a pre-coordinated plan with Moscow. An official announcement is made and he formally ceases to hold the position before June 1, with either an acting replacement or successor named.",
    "rationale": "The key evidence is Kadyrov's May 6, 2025 statement to The Moscow Times that he wants to step down as Chechen leader. This is significant and recent (only 6 days old), but several factors favor the status quo. First, 20 days is a very short timeframe for a major political transition in Russia's system. Even if Kadyrov is serious, transitions of this magnitude typically require Kremlin approval, coordination on succession, and bureaucratic processes that could easily extend beyond May 31. Second, political statements about stepping down don't always translate to immediate action - they can be tactical positioning, health-related concerns being voiced without immediate plans, or exploring options. Third, Kadyrov has held this position since 2007, suggesting institutional stability. However, I'm not going lower because: the statement is explicit and from a credible source; if health issues are urgent or if this was pre-coordinated with Putin, rapid action is possible; and unexpected political developments can occur quickly in autocratic systems. I would update higher if: additional reports indicate active transition planning, a successor is named, or Kadyrov's health issues are confirmed as serious. I would update lower if: days pass without further action, Kremlin sources indicate no immediate plans, or Kadyrov's recent statements suggest continuity.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ramzan Kadyrov cease to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Moscow Times: [Kadyrov Says He Wants to Step Down as Chechen Leader](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/06/kadyrov-says-he-wants-to-step-down-as-chechen-leader-a88991)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) Ramzan Kadyrov ceases to be the [Head of the Chechen Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_the_Chechen_Republic) before June 1, 2025, for any reason. Otherwise, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
