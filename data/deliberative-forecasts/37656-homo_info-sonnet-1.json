    "review": "Forecaster 2 introduces crucial information I missed: CPB has $535 million in Congressional appropriations through September 2027 and has filed a lawsuit asserting independence from executive control. This fundamentally changes the analysis. An executive order alone cannot override Congressional appropriations - that requires either Congressional action (extremely unlikely in 6 weeks with bipartisan support for public media) or protracted legal battles. Forecaster 3's point about Congressional opposition (including Murkowski) reinforces this barrier. All three of us identified the critical 14-day lag as revealing the tracker maintainers' standards - they're clearly waiting for actual implementation, not just policy announcements. The combination of pre-existing Congressional funding through 2027, active legal challenges, and only 6 weeks remaining creates nearly insurmountable barriers to marking this 'complete.'",
    "rationale": "I'm updating significantly downward based on structural barriers I underweighted. The Congressional appropriation through 2027 is the decisive factor - the executive order cannot unilaterally stop funds already appropriated by Congress. The tracker maintainers' 14-day non-response to the executive order demonstrates they require actual cessation of funding, not merely policy declarations. With CPB actively litigating its independence and Congressional funding locked in through 2027, there's no plausible mechanism for actual defunding to occur and be verified within 6 weeks. The only scenarios for Yes involve either the maintainers dramatically lowering their completion criteria (which the 14-day lag suggests they won't) or unprecedented rapid Congressional action to rescind appropriations (which bipartisan opposition makes impossible). Forecaster 2's 18% appropriately weights these structural barriers. I'm going slightly higher at 22% only because there's minor residual uncertainty about whether the maintainers might retroactively decide the executive order alone suffices, but this seems unlikely given their revealed preference.",
