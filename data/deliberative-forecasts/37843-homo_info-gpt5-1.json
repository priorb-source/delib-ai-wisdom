    "review": "Both forecasters correctly stress that, under the resolution criteria, the main path to Yes is a public S-1; a company blog/news post pre-filing is unlikely due to gun‑jumping concerns. I agree with their timing take: with ~5.5 weeks left, the status quo leans No. They add useful nuance: (1) banker selection in March makes a June public S-1 plausible (though not necessary), (2) some peers have filed weeks to months ahead, and (3) specific updaters to watch (governance changes, imminent roadshow chatter). I’m slightly less persuaded by the implication that a June public filing is common for a fall listing; most late-stage tech issuers tend to keep drafts confidential and go public closer to the roadshow. Forecaster 3’s point on mixed/volatile market conditions also nudges odds lower for a near-term public filing. Overall, their arguments modestly increase the plausibility of a June S-1 but don’t overcome the baseline No.",
    "rationale": "Base case remains No because (a) there is no public S-1 as of May 23, (b) companies often keep filings confidential until 4–8 weeks pre-roadshow, and (c) summer seasonality favors late July/August public filings for September/October listings. The blog/news-post path is unlikely given gun‑jumping risk. Evidence supporting a Yes—credible reporting of 2025 IPO plans and named lead banks—keeps a non-trivial chance that Discord opts to publicly file in June. The deliberation added reasonable scenarios where a June S-1 would make sense (starting SEC review publicly, pipeline momentum), but absent concrete signals of an imminent filing (e.g., governance moves, leaks of a draft, timing reports), I still view a pre–July 1 announcement as less likely than not. I edge my forecast up slightly to reflect the group’s argument that the IPO window is open enough for a June move.",
