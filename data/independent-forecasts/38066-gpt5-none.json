    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Both give separate solo talks/firesides with no overlap or handoff on stage; or one appears virtually; or one cancels or is a no‑show; or security/PR concerns keep them apart.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "YC schedules a joint fireside/panel, a closing Q&A including both, or an on-stage handoff where one briefly joins the other for an intro/exit (even a short handshake/photo-op) during the conference window.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: Conferences usually schedule headline speakers in separate solo slots; joint headliner appearances are less common unless explicitly billed. With no schedule yet, the status quo favors No.\n- Relationship/risk: Altman and Musk have a publicly adversarial relationship (e.g., Musk’s high-profile criticism/litigation against OpenAI/Altman). That makes a joint stage appearance less likely due to PR and security risk for YC, unless marketed as a debate. This pulls the probability down.\n- Attendance risk: Altman is likely to attend given YC ties; Musk is more uncertain and is known for last-minute changes. Any no-show or virtual appearance resolves No.\n- Countervailing factors: YC likes marquee moments; Altman previously interviewed Musk on a YC stage (2016), proving it’s not unprecedented. Even a brief on-stage handoff would count. If both attend in person, there’s a non-trivial chance of a short overlap engineered for buzz.\n- Decomposition (rough): P(Altman attends in person) ~0.9; P(Musk attends in person) ~0.7–0.75 ⇒ P(both) ~0.63–0.68. Conditional on both attending, chance of any on-stage overlap (panel/debate or brief handoff) ~0.15–0.20 given current tensions and standard event practice. Combined yields ~10–13%.\n- Research assistant: No additional info available; no schedule or organizer statements to move off base-rate reasoning.\n- Why not higher: Lack of announced joint session; adversarial context; common practice of solo headline talks; Musk attendance uncertainty.\n- Why not lower: YC’s appetite for buzz; historical precedent of them sharing a YC stage; low bar for “sharing a stage” (even a brief overlap counts) if both attend in person.\n- Up-side updates: Official schedule showing a joint session; organizer/PR tease of a debate or closing panel with both; credible reports that both will participate in a joint Q&A. Any of these would raise to 60–85%.\n- Down-side updates: Schedule showing strictly separate slots and staging; guidance to press that speakers will not overlap; reports of Musk switching to virtual or canceling; security constraints. These would drop to 2–8%, or 0% on a cancellation/virtual confirmation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
