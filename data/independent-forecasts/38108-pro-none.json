    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) identifies and claims significant savings, perhaps in the range of $120-$180 billion, by July 1, 2025. While a substantial achievement, this figure falls short of the $200 billion threshold due to bureaucratic delays, political pushback, or the simple difficulty of quantifying that level of waste in a few months.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capitalizing on high-level political support and advanced data analytics, Doge quickly identifies several massive areas of waste or fraud, particularly in pandemic relief funds and procurement contracts. Motivated to make a significant public impact, the department employs optimistic estimation methods to aggregate these findings, allowing them to publicly claim a total savings figure of $200 billion or more by the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant challenge of identifying and quantifying $200 billion in government waste within a very short timeframe. The initial estimate from February 2025 was 'over $100 billion,' and doubling this figure in approximately four months is an extraordinary task, even for a well-supported new department. The status quo for government initiatives is slow progress and resistance from entrenched interests, which strongly favors a 'No' outcome. The research assistant's report provided no additional information to alter this baseline. The key factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the resolution criteria, which hinge on a 'claim' rather than audited, realized savings. This provides significant leeway for politically motivated or optimistic accounting, especially for a 'disruptor' entity seeking to make a bold statement. My probability is not lower than 35% because the potential for identifying large-scale fraud (e.g., in COVID-19 relief funds) combined with aggressive accounting makes the high target plausible. My probability is not higher because government inertia is a powerful force, and the July 1, 2025 deadline is extremely close, leaving little time to clear bureaucratic hurdles and finalize such a large claim. I would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of a massive, specific find (e.g., a single fraud scheme exceeding $50 billion). I would decrease it upon news of significant political roadblocks or the departure of key personnel from the department.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Doge claim a total savings of $200 billion or more on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Tech guru admired by Elon Musk estimates ‘over $100 billion’ in taxpayer money is being wasted or stolen](https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/us-news/tech-guru-admired-by-elon-musk-estimates-over-100-billion-in-taxpayer-money-is-being-wasted-or-stolen/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Department of Government Efficiency [claims](https://doge.gov/savings) a total estimated savings of greater than or equal to $200 billion when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
