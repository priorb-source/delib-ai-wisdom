    "review": "My initial forecast of 60% was anchored on the current rig count of 585 being very close to the 583 threshold, acknowledging that the year-over-year trend was negative. The other forecasters provided critical context I had underweighted. Forecaster 2's introduction of the ~$65 WTI price environment and the negative Dallas Fed survey data provided a strong, immediate, cyclical reason for a decline, moving beyond my more structural argument. Forecaster 3's use of Q1 earnings from oilfield service companies showing a slowdown provided excellent, broad-based evidence confirming this negative momentum. Both arguments were highly convincing and revealed that my initial forecast was too conservative by not fully appreciating the strength of these current headwinds.",
    "rationale": "I am increasing my forecast from 60% to 75%. My initial analysis correctly identified the long-term structural trend towards capital discipline and efficiency, leading to a year-over-year decline. However, the other forecasters' evidence demonstrated that the short-term cyclical pressures are also strongly aligned in favor of a rig count decrease. \n\nThe WTI price of ~$65, as highlighted by Forecaster 2, is a powerful negative catalyst. At this level, many producers lack the incentive to add rigs and are more likely to reduce activity to preserve capital. This is corroborated by the Dallas Fed survey indicating a deteriorating outlook and rising uncertainty. Furthermore, as Forecaster 3 noted, the Q1 2025 earnings reports from major service companies like Baker Hughes and Halliburton confirm that this slowdown is not theoretical but is actively occurring across the industry.\n\nThis confluence of a negative structural trend, a weak commodity price environment, and confirmation of a broad slowdown from industry leaders makes a net decline of at least 3 rigs over the next five weeks highly probable. While the starting count of 585 is just above the threshold, the combined weight of these factors creates a strong downward momentum that is unlikely to reverse in such a short timeframe without a significant external shock. I am updating to 75% to reflect this much stronger conviction in a 'Yes' outcome, while still leaving a 25% probability to account for weekly data volatility and the low probability of a rapid sentiment shift.",
