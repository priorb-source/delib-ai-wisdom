    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the very short time horizon and the entrenched nature of censorship in these regimes. They add the useful framing that any real policy liberalization in China/Iran/NK/Turkmenistan/Myanmar over ~3 weeks is implausible, and they treat Pakistan/Tanzania/Turkey/India events as largely irrelevant to the seven in question. I agree that the dominant risk is not on-the-ground policy change but Wikipedia editorial reclassification, with Venezuela the weakest link and Russia a secondary risk. Where I differ is in sizing those Wikipedia risks for a conjunction event: to get to ~95%+, each country’s probability must be extremely high, and Venezuela/Russia don’t meet that bar for me given past ambiguity (intermittent throttling vs. full block, partial availability) and potential editorial churn if the page is updated to add Tanzania.\n",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~26 days favors status quo strongly.\n- Status quo outcome: Yes (all seven currently listed).\n- No scenario: Wikipedia reclassifies/removes any one of Russia or especially Venezuela from “current,” perhaps reflecting partial/intermittent blocking evidence or a sourcing cleanup prompted by other updates (e.g., Tanzania’s addition).\n- Yes scenario: No new credible measurements or policy changes emerge; editors leave the section as-is through end of June.\n- Update vs. prior: I initially overweighted the chance of near-term editorial reclassification. Given the very short window and lack of any new country-specific signals for the seven, I’m raising my forecast. However, I remain below 90% because this is a seven-way conjunction and Venezuela (and to a lesser extent Russia/Myanmar) have the most fluid classification histories on Wikipedia. Even a modest (5–10%) per-country reclassification risk on one or two entries meaningfully drags the joint probability.\n",
