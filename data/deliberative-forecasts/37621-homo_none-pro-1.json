    "review": "The other two forecasters presented compelling arguments that were similar in substance, both arriving at a 5% probability. Their core reasoning, which I found highly persuasive, was an emphasis on the NFL's procedural norms and institutional inertia. They correctly highlighted that the primary window for rule changes—the Annual League Meeting in March—has already passed. The failure to pass a ban then is a very strong signal that the required 24-owner consensus does not exist. They framed a rule change at this late stage as 'highly irregular' and 'unprecedented,' which more accurately captures the difficulty than my initial assessment of it being merely 'procedurally difficult.' They convinced me that I had overweighted the general controversy surrounding the play and underweighted the immense procedural hurdles to acting outside the established league calendar.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 15% to 5%. The deliberation with the other forecasters was crucial in refining my perspective. My initial analysis acknowledged the short timeframe and procedural difficulties, but I did not assign enough weight to the strong negative signal sent by the league's inaction during the March 2025 annual meeting. As the other forecasters argued, that was the proper venue for this debate. The fact that a vote was either not held or did not pass indicates a lack of the supermajority required for such a contentious rule change. For a ban to happen before the June 1 deadline, the league would need to convene a special meeting and the pro-ban coalition would have had to suddenly gain significant support in the last two months, providing enough urgency to break with longstanding NFL procedure. There is no evidence to suggest such a shift has occurred. The arguments of my fellow forecasters have convinced me that the probability of such an extraordinary series of events is much lower than I initially estimated. Therefore, I am decreasing my forecast by 10 percentage points to align with their more realistic assessment of the situation.",
