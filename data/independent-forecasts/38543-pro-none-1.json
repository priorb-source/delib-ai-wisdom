    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "15 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Presidential visits to major powers like China are complex diplomatic and logistical operations planned months in advance. With no visit currently announced or rumored, the status quo is that no visit will occur.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The remaining days of June pass without any major diplomatic breakthrough or international crisis that would necessitate an emergency, in-person meeting between President Trump and the leader of China. The deadline of July 1, 2025, arrives with Donald Trump not having visited China.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, acute international crisis erupts, for example, a military standoff in the Taiwan Strait, which requires an emergency in-person summit to de-escalate. Citing the need for direct talks, President Trump undertakes a hastily arranged, last-minute trip to Beijing before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The probability of this event is extremely low, primarily due to the very short timeframe of just 15 days. A US presidential visit to China involves immense security, logistical, and diplomatic preparation that is typically set in motion many weeks or months in advance. The current status quo, with no visit scheduled or being discussed publicly, is a very strong prior for a 'No' outcome. The only realistic, albeit highly improbable, scenario for a 'Yes' vote would be a sudden and severe international crisis that necessitates an emergency summit. My forecast is not zero to account for this 'black swan' possibility and Donald Trump's known preference for dramatic, personal diplomacy. However, the logistical barrier is immense. My forecast would only increase if there were credible intelligence or public reports suggesting a visit was being actively planned or that a crisis of sufficient magnitude was unfolding.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit China before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFox News: [Trump touts 'very positive' breakthrough with Xi after slamming China for trade violation](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-touts-very-positive-breakthrough-xi-after-slamming-china-trade-violation) | Wikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after this question opens and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits China.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
