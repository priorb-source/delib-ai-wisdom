  "information": "Airlines increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025. Jet2.com announced it would offer 1.6 million seats for the summer season, an 8% increase from 2024, with new routes from Bournemouth and London-Luton starting in April. Vueling offered over 145,000 seats to and from the islands for the Easter period, a 10% increase from the previous year. Air Nostrum increased its seat offerings by 7% for the same period. Binter also launched new routes from Córdoba to Gran Canaria starting in mid-April 2025.\n\nPassenger arrival data for the Canary Islands showed year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2025. AENA reported that traffic in the Canary Islands grew by 3.6% in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024. Monthly data showed a 2.2% increase in February and another 2.2% increase in March compared to the same months in 2024. The Easter holiday period in 2025 fell entirely within April, whereas in 2024, it was in late March.\n\nOn April 28, 2025, a massive power outage occurred on the Iberian Peninsula, affecting mainland Spain and Portugal. While the Canary Islands' power grid was not directly hit, the event caused significant disruptions to air travel. Reports indicated that air traffic at major hubs was operating at reduced capacity, leading to widespread flight delays and cancellations. Canary Islands airports experienced knock-on effects, with numerous flights connecting to the mainland being cancelled or delayed. One government official stated that 344 out of 6,000 scheduled flights in Spain were cancelled on that day.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The official data for April 2025 is expected to be published in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The established trend for the Canary Islands in early 2025 was continued year-over-year growth in passenger arrivals, supported by increased airline capacity.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The powerful growth drivers, particularly increased airline capacity and the entirety of the Easter 2025 holiday period falling within April, significantly boost passenger numbers, easily overcoming the negative impact of flight disruptions in the final days of the month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The knock-on effects of the Iberian power outage are more severe and prolonged for Canary Islands routes than initially reported, causing substantial cancellations and depressing traffic enough to narrowly erase the growth from the first 27 days of the month.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the overwhelming evidence pointing to year-over-year growth, making a decline ('Yes' outcome) unlikely. The primary evidence supporting a 'No' outcome includes a consistent growth trend, with a 3.6% increase in passenger traffic in Q1 2025 and 2.2% growth in both February and March. Furthermore, major airlines like Jet2.com, Vueling, and Air Nostrum significantly increased their seat capacity to the islands for the spring 2025 season. Critically, the entire Easter holiday period, a peak travel time, fell in April 2025, whereas it was in late March in 2024. This calendar effect alone should provide a substantial boost to the April 2025 numbers. The main argument for a 'Yes' outcome is the massive power outage on the Iberian Peninsula on April 28, which caused flight cancellations. However, this event occurred in the last three days of a 30-day month. While disruptive, the impact of a few hundred cancelled flights is unlikely to be large enough to reverse the strong growth trend established over the preceding 27 days, especially given the Easter holiday boost. My probability is not lower because the disruption was a real event that introduced significant last-minute uncertainty, and its full impact on Canary Islands tourism is not yet precisely known. My probability is not higher because the combined positive effects from the growth trend, increased capacity, and Easter timing create a very high baseline that would be difficult to fall below.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAirlines increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025.
