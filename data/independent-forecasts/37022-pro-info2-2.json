  "information": "In mid-March 2025, Ukraine received a disbursement from an IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) tranche amounting to $400 million, which is equivalent to approximately 16 billion UAH. Furthermore, the first tranche of EU ERA loans, valued at €1 billion, was expected in late March. Domestic bond auctions have continued to raise approximately 26 billion UAH per month. Debt servicing costs for March were reported to be modest.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome is likely already determined as the month in question, March 2025, has passed. The official data from the Ministry of Finance via Trading Economics is expected to be released imminently.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Ukraine's government debt has been significantly above the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold for several years. The prevailing trend is one of continued debt accumulation to finance the national budget and war effort, making the status quo a clear 'Yes'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "For the outcome to be 'No', the debt would have to fall below 1.90 trillion UAH. This scenario is exceptionally unlikely and would require an event such as an immediate and massive debt jubilee wiping out over 75% of Ukraine's existing debt, or a catastrophic error in the data reporting from official sources.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "This scenario involves the simple continuation of the established reality. Ukraine continues to finance its war-time budget deficit through borrowing from international partners and domestic bond sales, causing the total debt stock—already far exceeding 1.90 trillion UAH—to increase further through March 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the fact that the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold has been surpassed by Ukraine's government debt for a long time. According to the specified source, which cites Ukraine's Ministry of Finance, the debt stood at approximately 5.5 trillion UAH in early 2024 and has been on a consistent upward trajectory since. The primary driver is the need to finance a large budget deficit caused by the ongoing war. The information from my research assistant confirms this trend continued in the relevant month. The receipt of an IMF tranche (~16 billion UAH), an anticipated EU loan (~43 billion UAH), and ongoing domestic bond auctions (~26 billion UAH) in March 2025 all contribute to a net increase in the total debt stock, pushing it further above the very low threshold. The status quo strongly supports a 'Yes' resolution. My probability is not 100% simply to account for the extremely remote possibility of a major data reporting error, a retroactive revision, or a fundamental misunderstanding of the question's metric. However, based on all available economic data and trends, the outcome is a near-certainty. I would only lower my forecast upon evidence of a massive, unannounced debt forgiveness program being applied retroactively or a confirmed major error in the data source.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's government debt be at least 1.90 trillion UAH in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's government debt is greater than or equal to 1.90 billion UAH Thousand (in other words, 1.90 trillion Ukrainian hryvnia for the month of March 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/government-debt). Under 1.90 billion UAH Thousand resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn mid-March 2025, Ukraine received a disbursement from an IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) tranche amounting to $400 million, which is equivalent to approximately 16 billion UAH. Furthermore, the first tranche of EU ERA loans, valued at €1 billion, was expected in late March. Domestic bond auctions have continued to raise approximately 26 billion UAH per month. Debt servicing costs for March were reported to be modest.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
