    "review": "Forecaster 2’s argument aligns with my priors: the binding constraint is not just whether a big protest happens, but whether GPT creates a new entry with 10,000+ participants and a qualifying start date. Their claim that GPT has only one recent Turkey 10k+ entry (Oct 2023) reinforces a low base rate in this specific source. The emphasis on state repression and short horizon is sound. Forecaster 3’s reliance on the existence of a 2025 Wikipedia page is weak evidence for this question: (a) the link appears non-functional or minimal, (b) Wikipedia notability does not map to GPT inclusion, and (c) the question requires a new GPT entry with a post-launch start date. That key curation filter is largely unaddressed in their analysis, making 65% look overstated.",
    "rationale": "About 7 weeks remain. For a Yes, GPT must add a new Türkiye entry with a start date after launch and before July 1, and mark it at 10,000+. GPT tends to list distinct protest waves, not annual commemorations or continuations, and updates are conservative. Turkey can mobilize large crowds, but bans and policing often fragment events below the threshold unless the government permits a mass rally. Near-term catalysts exist (Gezi anniversary late May; Pride late June; potential regional trigger), but these are often contained or not treated by GPT as a new movement. The added “new GPT entry” requirement materially lowers odds versus “a large protest occurs” in general. Forecaster 2’s base-rate point about GPT’s sparse 10k+ entries for Turkey nudges me slightly lower than my prior. I would move higher on credible calls for a distinct, large nationwide action likely to be framed as a new wave (e.g., a clearly branded economic or political protest) or signs GPT is adding fresh 2025 entries of similar scale; lower if late May passes quietly and no large mobilizations are announced for June.",
