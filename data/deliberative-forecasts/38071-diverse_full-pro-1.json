    "review": "The deliberation with my fellow forecasters was valuable. All three of us identified the same key variables: Levar Stoney's lead in fundraising and a single internal poll, Aaron Rouse's strong organizational support and regional base, the large percentage of undecided voters, and the six-candidate field dynamics. Forecaster 3's analysis and 35% probability mirrored my own initial assessment almost perfectly, giving significant weight to the race's volatility and Rouse's plausible path to victory through superior mobilization in a low-turnout primary. Forecaster 2, arriving at a more bearish 23% for Rouse, placed greater emphasis on Stoney's concrete frontrunner advantages—money and polling—arguing these are the most reliable indicators. This perspective was particularly compelling, as it forced me to re-evaluate whether I was underestimating the power of a significant cash advantage to sway the large pool of undecided voters in the final, critical weeks of the campaign.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am making a modest downward adjustment to my forecast. My initial 35% forecast was based on the premise that in a fluid, low-turnout primary, Rouse's organizational strength could largely offset Stoney's financial and polling advantage. While I still believe this is Rouse's clearest path to victory and keeps him as a very credible contender, Forecaster 2's analysis convinced me to assign more weight to Stoney's dual advantages. With 63% of voters undecided as of March, the final three weeks will be a battle for name recognition and persuasion, particularly in the vote-rich Northern Virginia media market. Stoney's superior fundraising gives him a significant edge in that battle. Therefore, while Rouse remains a strong second with a viable path to winning, the status quo favors Stoney more than I initially calculated. I am adjusting my probability down by five points to reflect a slightly higher confidence in Stoney's ability to convert his financial advantage into votes among the large undecided population.",
