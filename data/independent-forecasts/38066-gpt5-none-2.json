    "yes_outcome_scenario": "YC schedules a joint panel/debate or an opening/closing segment where headline speakers are brought on stage together; or one drops in on the other’s session leading to a brief overlap on stage, with clear public evidence (photos/video).",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: At large conferences, headline speakers typically appear in separate keynotes/fireside chats unless a joint panel is explicitly announced. Without a published schedule indicating a joint session, the status quo favors No.\n- Relationship dynamics: Elon Musk and Sam Altman have been publicly adversarial; Musk has criticized OpenAI/Altman and filed (then dropped) a lawsuit in 2024. This makes a choreographed joint appearance less likely, as both sides have reputational and strategic reasons to avoid sharing a stage.\n- Logistics/security: High-profile figures often have tailored security and schedules; minimizing overlap is common unless a joint segment is a deliberate feature.\n- Reasons for Yes: YC could engineer a buzzy, student-facing “Future of AI” panel featuring both; YC has ties to both figures, and a joint appearance would generate enormous attention. Even a brief, orchestrated on-stage group segment or closing photo could satisfy the criteria if both are simultaneously on the platform and publicly documented.\n- Attendance risk: A Yes requires both to be physically present. Musk’s attendance at conferences can be volatile; any remote appearance or cancellation drives the probability down.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information available, so no evidence of a planned joint segment.\nWhy not higher: No schedule or teaser of a joint panel yet; strained relationship; base rates suggest separate appearances.\nWhy not lower: Both are announced headliners at a two-day event, creating multiple opportunities for YC to stage even a brief shared moment. YC might actively pursue a marquee joint session.\nUpdate signals upward: Official schedule or marketing indicating a joint panel/debate; public hints from YC/Garry Tan/Altman/Musk about appearing together; signs of a détente between OpenAI and Musk/xAI.\nUpdate signals downward: Either speaker cancels or appears remotely; schedule showing strictly separate venues/times with tight security; public statements implying they will not share a stage.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
