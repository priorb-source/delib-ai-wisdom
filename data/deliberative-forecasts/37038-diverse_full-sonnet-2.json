    "review": "The other forecasters provide compelling additional arguments that strengthen the case for a YES outcome. Forecaster 2's point about bureaucratic inertia is well-taken - maintaining the status quo requires no action, while changing it requires multiple deliberate steps. More importantly, both forecasters emphasize the leverage argument: keeping the '+17%' listed (even if suspended) maintains negotiating pressure. Why would the administration voluntarily surrender this leverage before securing a final agreement? This is a crucial strategic consideration I underweighted. Forecaster 3's detailed procedural analysis (Presidential Proclamation, Federal Register notice, HTS database update) clarifies the administrative barriers to a NO outcome, which could easily extend beyond 38 days even if a deal is reached. The broader trade context - with this administration actively using tariffs as negotiating tools across multiple fronts - also supports maintaining the listing through June 1. All three of us forecast in the 82-87% range, suggesting reasonable convergence. The main scenarios for NO (rapid deal concluded + immediate implementation + HTS update by June 1) face significant procedural and strategic headwinds that these forecasters have articulated more clearly than I did initially.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find their arguments about leverage and procedural barriers particularly persuasive and believe they actually strengthen rather than weaken my original forecast. The status quo - with '+17%' already listed in the HTS, regardless of suspended status - satisfies the YES resolution criteria. For a NO outcome within the next 38 days, we would need: (1) rapid conclusion of trade negotiations, (2) deliberate US government action to remove or modify the tariff, and (3) timely HTS database updates. The leverage argument is especially compelling: this administration views tariffs as negotiating tools, and removing the listing before finalizing a deal would surrender bargaining power for no gain. The 90-day suspension to July 9 signals that's the actual negotiation deadline, not June 1. While the US-Israel relationship is special and Israel has proactively eliminated its own tariffs, these factors don't overcome the short timeline and strategic incentives to maintain the current listing through early June. The procedural requirements for changing the HTS - even with political will - could easily consume the entire remaining window. I'm maintaining my 87% forecast as the evidence and arguments support this level of confidence that the +17% listing will persist through June 1.",
