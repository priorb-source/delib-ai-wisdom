    "review": "- I agree with both analysts that the status quo strongly favors No and that Sadr’s public messaging (March–May) is categorical.\n- The emphasis on the May 4 alliance-registration deadline is directionally right but somewhat overstated for resolution purposes: the question resolves on an announcement to field candidates, not formal registration. An announcement could precede or pressure an extension, or use a non-alliance vehicle. Still, the deadline is a real practical headwind and a signal of intent.\n- Forecaster 3’s timing analogy is flawed: Sadr’s 2021 reversal (mid-August for an Oct 10 election) came ~2 months before E-day. For a Nov 11, 2025 election, the analogous window would be mid-September, not late June. That weakens the case for a pre–July 1 announcement based on historical timing.\n- The “indirect participation” pathway wouldn’t necessarily count for resolution unless the Sadrist movement (regardless of branding) announces it will field candidates; proxies without such an announcement would likely resolve No.\n- The voter-record-update signal is weak/ambiguous; I wouldn’t weight it much without accompanying softening in rhetoric or organizational moves.",
    "rationale": "I keep the base case as No given: (1) repeated, emphatic boycott declarations; (2) no visible bargaining trajectory or concessions that would justify an early reversal; (3) historical pattern of late pivots suggests a reversal closer to September if it happens at all; (4) practical hurdles (alliance-registration window closing) decrease the plausibility of an imminent, credible re-entry. \n\nI slightly lower my prior (15%) to 14% after deliberation. The key change is recognizing that the historical timing argument actually cuts against a pre–July 1 announcement, not for it. I do not drop further because (a) Sadr’s reversals are well documented, (b) IHEC deadlines can be adjusted, and (c) he could announce intent first and solve mechanics later, which would still resolve Yes.\n\nUpside triggers: clear rhetorical softening (conditional participation), credible reports of negotiations that offer face-saving concessions, visible reactivation of campaign structures, or IHEC timeline adjustments/extensions. Downside triggers: May/June reiterations of a hard boycott with enforcement threats, organizational wind-downs, or movement toward influence via unbranded proxies without any announcement.",
