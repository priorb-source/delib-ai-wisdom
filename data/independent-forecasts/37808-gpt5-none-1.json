    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (roughly 42 days) until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the Step 1 “Submit an Entry” instructions page remains accessible at the specified travel.state.gov URL.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A State Department web redesign or CMS migration changes URL paths, leaving this specific URL returning a 404 or redirecting to a page that is not the Step 1 instructions; or an unexpected policy change removes the DV entry instructions page entirely.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "No major site changes occur before July 1, 2025, and the existing DV Step 1 instructions page continues to be hosted at the same URL (or the URL resolves to that exact page content).",
    "rationale": "- Base rate/status quo: U.S. government program pages on travel.state.gov are typically stable for long periods, and the Diversity Visa program has operated annually for decades. The Step 1 instructions page is generally present year-round, even when the entry window is closed. The time horizon is short (6 weeks), further favoring continuity. \n- Program/policy risk: Eliminating DV would require legislation; there has been political debate in past years, but no imminent repeal is publicly known, and such a change within 6 weeks is unlikely. Court actions have affected processing timelines, not the existence of the instructions page. \n- Technical/website risk: The main risk is a site reorganization or CMS update that alters URL structures or temporarily breaks specific pages. Government sites try to avoid link rot and often maintain legacy URLs or redirects, but the resolution requires that the Step 1 instructions page be “at this location.” If the URL redirects to a different page that Metaculus judges not to be the Step 1 instructions, that could resolve No. A brief outage is less concerning because the criterion allows access “on or after” July 1. \n- Why not higher: Small but real risk (~5–10%) of a web restructure or content shuffle that changes this exact path, plus minor operational outage/complication risk and ambiguity about whether a redirect would count. \n- Why not lower: Short time horizon, bureaucratic inertia, and the long-standing stability of travel.state.gov content argue strongly for persistence. \n- What would move me up: Confirmation that the URL currently resolves to the correct Step 1 instructions; explicit State Department notice that no near-term web migration is planned; evidence from web archives that this exact path has remained unchanged over multiple years. \n- What would move me down: Any sign of an ongoing travel.state.gov redesign/migration, the current URL beginning to 404 or redirect to a non-Step-1 page, or credible legislative movement to eliminate DV imminently. \n- Research assistant note: No additional information available; forecast based on general program stability and website continuity patterns.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US State Department's Diversity Visa page still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | [Donald Trump's 2017 tweet discussing the DV program](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925684982307348480)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Step 1 Submit an Entry page with instructions for registering for the Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) Program is at [this location](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html) when attempted to be accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
