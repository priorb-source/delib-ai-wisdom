  "information": "As of late May 2025, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) publicly claims total estimated savings of approximately $175 billion on its official tracker website. This figure represents a series of increases throughout early 2025. In late February, the claimed savings were $55 billion, which grew to $115 billion by mid-March. The claimed savings have been attributed to the cancellation of over 25,000 federal contracts and grants. According to DOGE, the most significant savings have been achieved at the Department of Health and Human Services, the General Services Administration, and the Education Department.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "31 days (question resolves on July 1, 2025, and today is May 31, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - DOGE currently claims $175 billion in savings, which is below the $200 billion threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "DOGE's claimed savings growth continues to slow as they exhaust easier targets. They face increased scrutiny on their methodology or political pushback, resulting in them reaching only $190-195 billion by July 1st, falling short of the $200 billion threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "DOGE maintains its recent pace of approximately $6 billion per week in claimed savings, or accelerates slightly as they approach the psychologically significant $200 billion milestone. They identify additional contract cancellations or savings opportunities, pushing them past $200 billion by early-to-mid June.",
    "rationale": "DOGE needs to claim an additional $25 billion in savings over the next 31 days to reach the $200 billion threshold. Historical trajectory shows: late February at $55B, mid-March at $115B (a $60B increase in ~2-3 weeks, or roughly $20-30B/week), and late May at $175B (a $60B increase over ~10 weeks, or roughly $6B/week). The pace has clearly decelerated over time, suggesting diminishing returns or increased difficulty in identifying claimable savings. However, at the recent pace of ~$6B/week, DOGE would accumulate approximately $26B over the next 4.4 weeks, just barely exceeding the needed $25B. Several factors favor reaching $200B: (1) they're very close to a psychologically and politically significant round number, (2) there's strong political incentive to demonstrate success, (3) the claims are self-reported with flexibility in methodology. Factors against: (1) the clear slowing trajectory suggests harder targets ahead, (2) 31 days is a relatively short window with no margin for error, (3) increased scrutiny could slow new claims. The forecast is not higher because the slowing pace indicates real constraints, and any disruption could prevent them from reaching the threshold. It's not lower because their current trajectory does technically get them there, and political pressure likely favors pushing to $200B. I would update higher if I saw evidence of acceleration in claimed savings or new major savings announcements; I would update lower if claims stalled or faced significant public challenge.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Doge claim a total savings of $200 billion or more on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Tech guru admired by Elon Musk estimates ‘over $100 billion’ in taxpayer money is being wasted or stolen](https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/us-news/tech-guru-admired-by-elon-musk-estimates-over-100-billion-in-taxpayer-money-is-being-wasted-or-stolen/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Department of Government Efficiency [claims](https://doge.gov/savings) a total estimated savings of greater than or equal to $200 billion when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) publicly claims total estimated savings of approximately $175 billion on its official tracker website.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
