    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 47 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Mark Carney is not currently Prime Minister; Morning Consult would not report an approval rating for him, so the condition would not be met.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Justin Trudeau remains PM (or any non-Carney PM remains in office) through and after July 1, so Morning Consult does not list Carney; or Carney becomes PM but his approval is equal to or lower than Trump’s when Metaculus checks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid leadership change occurs before (or very shortly after) July 1: Trudeau resigns, Liberals install Mark Carney as leader/PM on an expedited basis, Morning Consult adds him to the tracker, and he enjoys a honeymoon approval that exceeds Trump’s mid-40s approval when Metaculus checks on/after July 1.",
    "rationale": "The key hinge is whether Mark Carney is Prime Minister by the time Metaculus checks the Morning Consult tracker on or after July 1, 2025. If he is not PM, he will not have a Morning Consult approval rating, and the question resolves No by construction. Given today’s date (May 15, 2025), the time window for such a leadership transition is very short. While it is constitutionally possible for a governing party to replace its leader and for that leader to become PM without a general election, the practical path for Carney is unlikely in the next 6–8 weeks: he is not currently an MP nor party leader, and Canadian leadership selection processes typically take months; interim leaders, if needed, would more plausibly be senior sitting ministers. Morning Consult’s U.S. presidential approval for Trump is likely in the low-to-mid 40s and relatively sticky; if Carney somehow became PM, a short honeymoon could plausibly put him above Trump, so conditional on Carney becoming PM, the chance of beating Trump’s approval might be better than even. But the dominant uncertainty is Carney becoming PM in time, which appears to be a low-probability event. Research assistant provided no additional info; thus I weight base rates and process constraints heavily. Why not higher: because leadership turnover to Carney by early July would require an unusually fast and coordinated party transition. Why not lower: a small tail remains for a sudden resignation/appointment scenario with caucus acclamation, and if that occurs, Carney’s initial approval could readily exceed Trump’s. Updates that would move me higher: credible reports of Trudeau announcing resignation; strong caucus/party backing for Carney with an expedited process; signals that Morning Consult would list Carney promptly upon appointment; Trump’s approval dipping further. Updates that would move me lower: confirmations that Trudeau will stay at least through the summer; party signals preferring a different interim or permanent leader; Trump’s approval rising.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mark Carney has a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
