    "review": "- Forecaster 2: Largely aligns with my prior. Sound emphasis on CFTC precedent (ErisX NFL disapproval) and the fragility of an \"every day\" criterion. I agree with their weighting of status quo and with the key update triggers.\n- Forecaster 3: The main push upward is the implicit assumption that Kalshi already runs real-money MLB markets and can trivially automate daily listings. That’s plausible operationally, but unproven here; a category/tag page isn’t sufficient evidence. I agree with their compounding-reliability point, but if we model even 98–99% per-day reliability, the 30-day success rate is only ~55–74% conditional on the product being live, and that still needs to be multiplied by the chance that sports markets are permitted and ongoing in June. Without verified current listings or regulatory comfort, 62% feels too high.\n- New arguments considered: (1) If sports/MLB are already live, the incremental cost to hit daily coverage is minimal; (2) MLB plays every day in June, so demand-opportunity exists. These nudge me modestly upward, but do not overcome regulatory/base-rate and the all-days requirement.",
    "rationale": "I started at 20% on the basis that: (a) the CFTC has a history of treating sports event contracts as contrary to the public interest/gaming; (b) I lack confirmation that Kalshi currently lists real-money MLB markets; and (c) the \"every day\" criterion is brittle—one missed day resolves No.\n\nUpdating on the deliberation:\n- I credit Forecaster 3’s point that, conditional on MLB markets being live, daily listing is operationally easy and MLB’s schedule supports it. That boosts P(continue daily | already live).\n- However, absent verification that real-money MLB markets are already up, and given correlated regulatory/strategic risk that could pause sports, my prior on P(already live and uninterrupted through June) remains modest. The compounding math is also a brake: even with 99% per-day reliability, you only get ~74% across 30 days, and that’s conditional on listings existing and not being halted for policy reasons.\n\nNet: I make a small upward adjustment to reflect the feasibility if live, but I still weight the regulatory base rate and the strictness of the criterion heavily. I would move up quickly if we observe consecutive early-June days with MLB listings or a clear statement from Kalshi about daily MLB coverage; I’d move down immediately on any missed day or adverse regulatory signal.",
