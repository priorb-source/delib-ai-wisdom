  "information": "Six Democrats are running in the June 17 primary for Virginia lieutenant governor: Alex Bastani, State Sen. Ghazala F. Hashmi, Babur B. Lateef, State Sen. Aaron R. Rouse, Victor Salgado, and former Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney. While the candidates agree on many core policies, such as repealing Virginia's right-to-work law and increasing the minimum wage, they differ on specific issues like gaming and education. Rouse, a former Virginia Beach City Council member, has sponsored legislation to strengthen protections for renters and to create a regulatory framework for the state's recreational cannabis market. Stoney has positioned himself as both business-friendly and committed to helping families. Hashmi, a former professor, highlights her six years of experience in the Senate.\n\nAccording to campaign finance records reported around May 1, 2025, Levar Stoney led the six-candidate field in fundraising, having raised approximately $1.4 million. State Senators Aaron Rouse and Ghazala Hashmi were also among the fundraising leaders. In late May, Carl Eggleston, a former candidate for lieutenant governor and the first African American to be elected to the Farmville Town Council, endorsed Levar Stoney, citing his executive experience. Reports also indicate Stoney has the backing of several Richmond-area elected officials, while Rouse has support from labor and progressive-issue groups.\n\nAn internal poll conducted for the Levar Stoney campaign in March 2025 showed Stoney leading the primary field with 16% support, followed by Aaron Rouse at 10%, and Ghazala Hashmi at 8%; 63% of voters were undecided. Geographically, Rouse's political base is in the Hampton Roads area (Virginia Beach/Norfolk), while Stoney's is in the Richmond metro area. Northern Virginia represents the largest voting bloc in the primary but does not have a candidate from the region.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The primary election is scheduled for June 17, 2025, which is 21 days from today's date of May 27, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Levar Stoney wins the primary. His current lead in fundraising and early polling suggests he is the frontrunner, and without a major shift, he is best positioned to win over the large number of undecided voters.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Levar Stoney leverages his significant fundraising advantage to run a strong advertising campaign in the expensive Northern Virginia media market, winning over a large portion of the undecided voters. Stoney's executive experience as former Richmond mayor, combined with key endorsements, resonates more with primary voters than Rouse's legislative record, leading to a plurality victory for Stoney.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Rouse's support from labor and progressive groups translates into a superior get-out-the-vote operation that outperforms polling. He solidifies his Hampton Roads base while Levar Stoney and Ghazala Hashmi split the vote in the Richmond area. Rouse makes sufficient inroads with undecided voters in Northern Virginia to win a narrow plurality in the crowded six-person field.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the current state of the race, which shows Levar Stoney as the nominal frontrunner and Aaron Rouse as a strong but second-place contender. The most significant factor is the high number of undecided voters, reported at 63% in a March 2025 internal poll. This indicates the race is still highly fluid. However, Stoney holds key advantages. He leads in fundraising, having raised $1.4 million by early May, which provides a crucial resource for advertising and outreach in the final three weeks, particularly in the vote-rich Northern Virginia media markets. The same internal poll, while needing to be viewed with caution, placed Stoney ahead of Rouse, 16% to 10%. Stoney also has endorsements from figures like former candidate Carl Eggleston and Richmond-area officials, bolstering his base. Rouse's path to victory is plausible. His strengths include a solid geographic base in Hampton Roads, where he is the only major candidate, and support from labor and progressive groups, which can be critical for get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts in a potentially low-turnout primary. A strong GOTV operation could outperform a campaign more reliant on paid media. The crowded six-candidate field also lowers the threshold for victory, meaning a candidate can win with a plurality rather than a majority. My forecast is not lower than 35% because Rouse is a credible state senator with a clear base and institutional support, making him a serious contender in a fluid race. My forecast is not higher because he is currently trailing on the two most powerful predictive metrics: fundraising and polling. To increase my forecast for Rouse, I would need to see new public polling showing the race tightening or Rouse taking the lead, or evidence of a significant late-game momentum shift such as a major endorsement from a Northern Virginia politician. Conversely, new data showing Stoney expanding his lead would cause me to lower the probability.",
