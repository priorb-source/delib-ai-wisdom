  "information": "The typical process for an initial public offering of this size involves preparatory steps that have not been publicly observed for Anthropic. There have been no reports or leaks to major financial news outlets like Reuters, the Wall Street Journal, or Bloomberg about the company hiring investment banks or filing a confidential S-1 form. Among U.S. venture-backed companies valued at over $10 billion (decacorns), the base rate for going public is approximately one to two companies per year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks, from May 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Anthropic has not announced IPO plans and there are no public signals of imminent IPO preparation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic continues operating as a private company, possibly raising additional private funding rounds to support its operations and research. The company decides that remaining private offers more strategic flexibility, or market conditions are not favorable for an IPO. No S-1 filing or official announcement occurs before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic surprises the market by filing an SEC Form S-1 or announcing on their website that they are planning an IPO. This could happen if the company has been preparing confidentially and decides to accelerate their timeline, or if competitive pressures or strategic opportunities make a quick public offering attractive.",
    "rationale": "The probability of this resolving Yes is very low based on several factors. First, the timeframe is extremely short - only 6.5 weeks remain. IPOs of this magnitude typically require months of visible preparation including hiring investment banks, conducting roadshows, and extensive regulatory filings. My research assistant confirms there have been no reports or leaks to major financial outlets about such preparations. Second, the base rate is unfavorable - only 1-2 decacorns IPO per year from a much larger pool of candidates. Third, Anthropic recently floated a $40 billion private valuation, suggesting they have access to private capital and may not need the public markets immediately. Fourth, the resolution criteria require very specific, concrete actions (S-1 filing or official website announcement) - not just speculation or preliminary discussions. The probability is not zero because companies can sometimes accelerate timelines for strategic reasons, and confidential preparations could theoretically be underway. However, given the complete absence of any preparatory signals and the extremely compressed timeline, I would need to see concrete evidence of investment bank hiring, leaked S-1 preparations, or official company statements to meaningfully increase this forecast. Conversely, announcements of new private funding or statements ruling out near-term IPO plans would push this even lower.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe typical process for an initial public offering of this size involves preparatory steps that have not been publicly observed for Anthropic. There have been no reports or leaks to major financial news outlets like Reuters, the Wall Street Journal, or Bloomberg about the company hiring investment banks or filing a confidential S-1 form. Among U.S. venture-backed companies valued at over $10 billion (decacorns), the base rate for going public is approximately one to two companies per year.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
