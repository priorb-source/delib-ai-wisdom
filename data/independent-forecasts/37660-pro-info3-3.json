  "information": "Reports from late April and early May 2025 provide context on Starlink's expansion in the region. Bangladesh's telecommunication regulator granted Starlink two 10-year operating licenses, making it the second South Asian country after Sri Lanka to approve the service. Officials indicated that Starlink was preparing to launch service in Bangladesh by May 2025. In contrast, Starlink's full license in Pakistan is delayed pending permanent registration and the clearance of technical and security checks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, May 16, 2025, the Starlink availability map does not show service as 'Available' in Sri Lanka.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite receiving its license in 2024, Starlink encounters unexpected logistical delays in deploying ground infrastructure or importing user terminals. Alternatively, last-minute administrative or security reviews by the Sri Lankan government, similar to delays seen in Pakistan, push the operational launch past the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Having completed the necessary ground infrastructure deployment in the ten months since receiving its license, and leveraging the operational momentum from its recent launch in Bangladesh, Starlink officially activates service in Sri Lanka. The Starlink availability map is updated to 'Available' sometime in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "The key factor driving this forecast is the substantial lead time. Starlink received its operating license from Sri Lanka in August 2024, providing nearly a year for all necessary logistical, technical, and administrative preparations. This timeframe is typically more than sufficient for Starlink to prepare a new country for service. The status quo, where the service is not yet active, is expected at this stage, but the groundwork for change has been laid. My confidence is further bolstered by Starlink's concurrent and successful expansion in the region, particularly the imminent launch in Bangladesh. This indicates a clear strategic focus on South Asia and suggests that operational resources and expertise are already mobilized nearby, which should streamline the Sri Lankan rollout. \n\nMy probability is not higher because unforeseen delays are always a possibility in such rollouts, as evidenced by the holds in Pakistan due to technical and security checks. A similar last-minute bureaucratic hurdle in Sri Lanka, or a delay in the supply chain for ground stations or user terminals, could easily push the launch date past the relatively short remaining window before July 1. \n\nMy probability is not lower because the primary and most difficult obstacle—securing the operating license—was cleared long ago. Unlike in Pakistan, there are no reports of outstanding issues in Sri Lanka. Given the long lead time and regional activity, it is more likely than not that the launch is proceeding as planned. \n\nI would increase my forecast upon seeing official announcements of a specific launch date or reports of user terminals arriving in the country. I would decrease it if any news emerges about new regulatory reviews or technical disagreements between Starlink and the Sri Lankan government.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Sri Lanka as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Musk's Starlink wins Sri Lanka licence](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/sri-lanka-regulator-grants-licence-musks-starlink-satellite-broadband-2024-08-13/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Sri Lanka listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nReports from late April and early May 2025 provide context on Starlink's expansion in the region.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
