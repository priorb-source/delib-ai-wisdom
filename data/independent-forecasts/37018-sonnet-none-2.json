    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ballerini loses all three categories she is nominated in, with other artists winning those awards. This could occur if she faces strong competition in each category or if other artists have had particularly dominant years in country music.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ballerini wins at least one of her three nominated categories at the ceremony. With multiple nominations, she has several opportunities to secure a win, and she is an established artist with previous ACM recognition in her career.",
    "rationale": "With 3 nominations, Ballerini has multiple opportunities to win at least one award. Using basic probability: if we assume roughly 5 nominees per category (typical for ACM Awards), each nomination carries approximately a 20% chance of winning. The probability of winning at least one award across 3 independent nominations would be approximately 1 - (0.8)^3 = 48.8%. However, this calculation assumes equal competition across categories and independence between nominations. Factors supporting a higher forecast: Ballerini is an established artist with previous ACM wins, and having 3 nominations suggests strong industry recognition this year. Factors supporting a lower forecast: We lack crucial information about which specific categories she's nominated in, who her competition is, and whether she's considered a frontrunner in any category. Award outcomes are inherently unpredictable, and being nominated doesn't guarantee victory. Without information from the research assistant about her specific nominations or competition, I must rely on the baseline mathematical probability. My forecast would increase if I learned she was nominated in categories where she's a clear favorite or if she had won precursor awards. It would decrease if I learned she faced particularly strong competition or was nominated in categories where she's not competitive.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kelsea Ballerini win an award at the 60th Academy of Country Music Awards?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe awards are scheduled to be held on May 8, 2025. Ballerini has 3 nominations.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kelsea Ballerini wins an award at the [60th Academy of Country Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_Academy_of_Country_Music_Awards).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
