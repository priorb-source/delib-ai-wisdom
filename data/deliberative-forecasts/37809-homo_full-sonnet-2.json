    "review": "All three forecasters identified the same critical factors and reached remarkably similar conclusions (18-22% range), suggesting strong consensus on the evidence. Forecaster 2 provided helpful specific math: approximately 35 games/140 at-bats hitting at Judge's xBA of .362 would result in ~.384 average, which quantifies the expected regression. Forecaster 3 made an excellent point about Judge's 'minimal cushion' - he's at .401, barely 1 point above the threshold, not comfortably at .410 or .420. This means even slight regression immediately threatens the threshold. However, neither forecaster presented fundamentally new evidence that changes the core analysis. The tight clustering around 20% (with a 4-point range) indicates we've all properly assessed the competing factors: current positioning versus overwhelming regression indicators and historical precedent.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find the consensus range of 18-22% validates my original reasoning. The key factors remain: (1) Judge sits at .401 with minimal cushion, (2) BABIP and xBA indicate significant overperformance likely to regress, (3) zero players have achieved this in 25 years on July 1st, (4) 42 days provides some variance opportunity but isn't long enough to overcome statistical expectations. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the 'minimal cushion' is compelling - Judge isn't comfortably above .400, he's barely there. This could justify moving slightly toward 18%. However, the 6-week timeframe and presence of backup candidates (Freeman, Ohtani) provide some probability. The mathematical reality is stark: if Judge hits even a strong .375 over the next 40-45 games, his average likely falls to .388-.390. The historical and statistical evidence for regression is overwhelming. I remain at 20% as it represents the center of our consensus range, balancing the favorable starting position against extremely strong regression indicators.",
