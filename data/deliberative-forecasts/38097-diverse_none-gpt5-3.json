    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds the crucial point that Laurent Gbagbo was already removed from the electoral list in October 2024 due to his 2018 conviction, citing credible reporting (the BBC link in the prompt). That directly matches the resolution criterion (“has been removed from the electoral list… before July 1, 2025”), meaning the condition for a Yes appears already satisfied. Their residual uncertainty only reflects the small chance of a politically driven reversal or an alternative interpretation of the question. Forecaster 3 underweights this and treats disqualification as a prospective event, leaning on base rates and the short timeline, but that misses the fact that one of the named figures has already been removed. I find Forecaster 2’s argument substantially more persuasive given the specific evidence tied to the resolution criteria.",
    "rationale": "Given the BBC-cited removal of Laurent Gbagbo from the electoral roll in Oct 2024, the event condition (“any of these candidates has been removed… before July 1, 2025”) has already occurred. Even if one entertained a rapid reinstatement scenario, the criterion hinges on the removal event having occurred, not its persistence. Residual uncertainty is limited to potential question-interpretation ambiguity (e.g., requiring the removal to occur after a certain start date or only counting if they’re formally declared candidates) or an unforeseen clarification by organizers. Absent such an interpretive twist, this should resolve Yes. I’m updating up substantially from my prior 37% to reflect this already-met condition, aligning close to Forecaster 2 while leaving a small margin for interpretation risk.",
