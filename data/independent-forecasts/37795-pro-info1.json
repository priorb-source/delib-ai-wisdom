  "information": "As of mid-May 2025, the Colorado Rockies held a record of 8-38, equivalent to a .174 winning percentage. Their run differential was -128. The team's pitching staff ranked last in the league with a 5.80 ERA and a 1.599 WHIP. Offensively, they had the league's worst On-base Plus Slugging (OPS), the most strikeouts at 418, a low walk rate of 7.7%, and a low home run rate of 2.3%. The next-worst team in the league at the time, the Chicago White Sox, had a winning percentage approximately 112 points higher at .286.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The outcome will be known on or after June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The Colorado Rockies currently have a winning percentage of .174, which is significantly lower than any other team in the MLB.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies experience a significant and uncharacteristic improvement in performance, winning a surprising number of games before June 15. Concurrently, another team, such as the Chicago White Sox, enters a severe losing streak, causing their winning percentage to drop below the Rockies' by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies continue to perform at or near their current level, which is the worst in the league by a considerable margin. Their pitching and offense remain at the bottom of league rankings, and they continue to lose games far more often than they win, maintaining the lowest winning percentage through June 15.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is based on the overwhelming statistical evidence that the Colorado Rockies are the worst team in Major League Baseball by a substantial margin. As of mid-May 2025, their .174 winning percentage is .112 points lower than the next-worst team. This is a massive gap to close in less than a month. The Rockies' underlying metrics, as provided in the report, confirm their poor performance: they rank last in ERA (5.80), WHIP (1.599), and OPS, with a league-worst -128 run differential, which is a strong predictor of a team's true talent level. Given the short time frame until June 15, the status quo is highly likely to persist. A significant reversal of fortune for the Rockies or a catastrophic collapse by another team would be required for a 'No' outcome, which is a low-probability event. My probability is not higher than 95% to account for the inherent variance in professional sports, where unexpected short-term winning or losing streaks can occur. It is not lower because the performance gap between the Rockies and the rest of the league is not marginal but a chasm, supported by every key performance indicator. My forecast would decrease if the Rockies were to go on a multi-game winning streak while the White Sox simultaneously entered a prolonged losing streak.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMile High Sports: [The Colorado Rockies have lost a generation of fans](https://milehighsports.com/the-colorado-rockies-have-lost-a-generation-of-fans/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of mid-May 2025, the Colorado Rockies held a record of 8-38, equivalent to a .174 winning percentage.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
