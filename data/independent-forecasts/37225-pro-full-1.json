  "information": "The most recent poll, conducted on April 22, 2025, projects the Progressive Reform Party (VHP) winning 29% of seats, the National Democratic Party (NDP) 24%, and the National Party of Suriname (NPS) 14%. An earlier poll from January 2025 showed the NDP at 54% and the VHP at 29%. The incumbent VHP, led by President Chandrikapersad Santokhi, aims to secure at least 26 of the 51 available seats in the National Assembly. The opposition NDP has publicly ruled out any post-election collaboration with the VHP.\n\nPositive economic factors for the incumbent VHP government include a reduction in inflation from 60% to 10%, compliance with an IMF program, and the signing of a Final Investment Decision with TotalEnergies for the Granmorgu oil field. The government also instituted a 15% salary increase for government employees and pensioners in 2024, with an additional 5% in January 2025. Conversely, negative factors include high public dissatisfaction, with 56% of the public dissatisfied with the current government and 66% believing the country is worse off than five years prior. The country faces persistent poverty and a $4 billion national debt. One report cited President Santokhi's approval rating at approximately 3%.\n\nThe general election is scheduled for May 25, 2025. A significant change in the electoral process is the shift to a National Proportional Representation system, which replaces the previous district-based system and will be used for the first time. The opposition is described as fragmented. The NDP is facing challenges after the death of former leader Desi Bouterse. Some smaller parties, including the Sociaal Democratische Unie (SDU), Permanente Voorspoed Republiek Suriname (PVRS), and De Nieuwe Wind (DNW), have formed an alliance to run together under the SDU banner.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with results expected shortly after the May 25, 2025 election.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Progressive Reform Party (VHP) wins the most seats, as indicated by the most recent polling from April 22, 2025, which shows them with a 5-point lead over their nearest rival, the National Democratic Party (NDP).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Widespread public dissatisfaction with the incumbent government, evidenced by a 3% presidential approval rating, galvanizes voters. The opposition National Democratic Party (NDP) overcomes its recent leadership challenges and successfully consolidates the anti-government vote, reversing the trend seen in the latest poll and ultimately winning more seats than the VHP.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The VHP's recent positive economic news, including reduced inflation and a major oil investment deal, combined with pre-election salary increases, persuades enough voters to overlook their dissatisfaction. The opposition remains fragmented, allowing the VHP to secure a plurality of seats, consistent with the April 2025 polling.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the most recent polling data from April 22, 2025, which places the incumbent Progressive Reform Party (VHP) ahead of the National Democratic Party (NDP) by 29% to 24%. This represents a significant positive swing for the VHP compared to a January 2025 poll. This momentum is likely supported by tangible government achievements, including a drastic reduction in inflation, compliance with an IMF program, securing a major oil investment, and strategically timed salary increases for public sector employees. Furthermore, the opposition is described as fragmented, and the main opposition NDP is managing a leadership transition, which may hinder its ability to fully capitalize on anti-incumbent sentiment.\n\nHowever, my forecast is not higher than 65% due to extremely strong countervailing factors. Public dissatisfaction is exceptionally high, with 66% of the population believing the country is worse off and President Santokhi's approval rating at a critically low 3%. This indicates a volatile electorate that could easily swing against the incumbents. The dramatic shift in polls between January (NDP at 54%) and April (VHP at 29%) suggests that voter intention is not firmly set. The introduction of a new National Proportional Representation system also adds a degree of uncertainty to the outcome.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the opposition, despite the fertile ground of public discontent, has not yet demonstrated in recent polling that it can consolidate this sentiment into a winning plurality. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see new polls showing the VHP widening its lead or evidence of further disarray within the NDP. To decrease my forecast, I would look for new polls showing the NDP closing the gap or a significant event that unites the fragmented opposition against the VHP.",
