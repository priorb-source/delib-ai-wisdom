  "information": "As of early May 2025, Republika Srpska (RS) has taken several legislative and political steps. A draft for a new constitution, which includes rights to self-determination and provisions for confederal relationships, completed its public consultation phase in mid-April 2025. The RS government has also passed laws to ban Bosnia's central judicial, police, and intelligence agencies from operating within its territory. Milorad Dodik, the leader of RS, has stated he is willing to declare independence if the central authorities, with international support, attempt to take control of RS property. Similarly, Nenad Stevanović, President of the RS Parliament, warned that continued pressure would lead to a declaration of independence, stating that RS is a functional entity capable of implementing its decisions independently.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Republika Srpska continues confrontational rhetoric and legislative assertions of autonomy but stops short of officially scheduling an independence referendum",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "RS continues its brinkmanship strategy, using the threat of independence as leverage in negotiations with the central government and international community. Dodik and other leaders maintain their conditional rhetoric ('if authorities attempt to take control...') but calculate that actually scheduling a referendum would trigger sanctions, isolation, and economic damage while undermining their negotiating position. Internal divisions or international pressure persuade RS leadership to maintain strategic ambiguity rather than cross the threshold to formally announcing a referendum date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The situation escalates over the next two months due to either central Bosnian government attempts to enforce authority in RS territory or new international pressure perceived as threatening. RS leadership decides to formalize their independence position by officially announcing a referendum date, possibly capitalizing on the momentum from their recently completed constitutional draft process. This could be triggered by a specific incident, perceived Western intervention, or a strategic calculation that announcing the date (even if the referendum itself is delayed or blocked) serves their political objectives domestically and regionally.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report shows significant recent escalation: RS completed public consultation on a constitutional draft including self-determination rights in mid-April 2025, passed laws banning central authorities from operating in their territory, and multiple officials (Dodik and Stevanović) have made explicit independence threats. This represents concrete institutional preparation beyond mere rhetoric. However, several factors favor the status quo outcome: (1) Historical pattern - Dodik has threatened secession repeatedly over the years without following through, suggesting this is primarily a negotiating tactic; (2) The threats remain conditional ('if authorities attempt to take control...') rather than unconditional commitments; (3) Actually scheduling a referendum would trigger severe international consequences including sanctions and end EU membership prospects; (4) Only 60 days remain, and while this is sufficient for an announcement, there's no indication of an imminent crisis that would force RS's hand; (5) The threat of a referendum may be more useful as leverage than the actual announcement. The recent escalation is meaningful - this isn't just talk, as evidenced by the constitutional consultations and legislative actions. The probability should be higher than a typical base rate for threatened but not implemented political actions. However, extreme actions like independence referendums face high barriers and the historical pattern suggests caution. For my forecast to move higher, I would need to see: an acute crisis or confrontation with central authorities, explicit Russian endorsement of independence, or RS beginning to publicize specific referendum plans. For my forecast to move lower, I would need: de-escalatory signals from RS leadership, international mediation succeeding, or the constitutional process stalling.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early May 2025, Republika Srpska (RS) has taken several legislative and political steps. A draft for a new constitution, which includes rights to self-determination and provisions for confederal relationships, completed its public consultation phase in mid-April 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
