  "information": "Sheikh Hasina has been in exile in India since being ousted from power in August 2024. In statements made in February 2025, she vowed to return to Bangladesh, accusing the interim government of unleashing terrorists and promising to seek justice. Legally, she faces multiple challenges. Bangladesh's International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) has issued her a show-cause notice in a contempt of court case, with a response required by May 15, 2025. Additionally, a separate ICT investigation into alleged crimes against humanity committed during the July 2024 uprising is reportedly in its final stages, with a probe report expected to be submitted within May 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Sheikh Hasina remains in exile in India and does not enter Bangladesh.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Facing imminent and severe legal charges, including for crimes against humanity, Sheikh Hasina concludes that returning to Bangladesh is too risky. She remains in India, where she is safe, and continues her political activities from exile. The Indian government does not extradite her within the given timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either as a high-stakes political gamble to rally her supporters and face her accusers, or as a result of an extradition agreement between India and Bangladesh's interim government, Sheikh Hasina enters Bangladeshi territory before July 1, 2025, and is likely taken into custody.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily weights the status quo, as Sheikh Hasina's current situation in exile is far safer for her than returning to Bangladesh. The primary factor driving this low probability is the severe and imminent legal jeopardy she faces. The research indicates that an investigation into crimes against humanity is in its final stages, with a report expected in May 2025, and a separate contempt of court case requires her response by May 15, 2025. These are not abstract threats; they are concrete, high-stakes legal proceedings that would almost certainly lead to her immediate arrest upon return. A rational actor would avoid this outcome. Her public vows to return are likely political posturing to maintain relevance and rally her base, rather than a statement of immediate intent. The probability is not lower than 10% because a return is not impossible. It could occur through two main, albeit unlikely, pathways. First, she could make a high-risk political calculation to return voluntarily, hoping to galvanize her supporters and cast herself as a martyr. Second, there is a non-zero chance that India could agree to an extradition request from the Bangladeshi interim government, especially if a compelling legal case is presented. My forecast would increase with credible reports of extradition talks between India and Bangladesh. Conversely, my forecast would decrease if the International Crimes Tribunal formally issues charges of crimes against humanity, as this would solidify the legal risks and make a voluntary return almost inconceivable.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sheikh Hasina return to Bangladesh before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFirstpost: [Bangladesh has turned into a ‘terrorist country’: Sheikh Hasina targets Yunus, vows to return](https://www.firstpost.com/world/bangladesh-has-turned-into-a-terrorist-country-sheikh-hasina-targets-yunus-vows-to-return-13878191.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
