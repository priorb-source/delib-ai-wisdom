    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. Forecaster 2's reasoning is exceptionally sound and aligns closely with my initial assessment. They correctly identify the key drivers: the short timeframe, platform preferences (Trump not using X), and shifting focus (Musk depoliticizing his feed). Their point about Trump's specific history of criticizing the Diversity Visa is a valid consideration I had not explicitly weighed, though it does not fundamentally alter the low probability. Forecaster 3's analysis is critically flawed. Their entire rationale is based on the incorrect premise that the deadline of April 1, 2025 has already passed. The resolution criteria clearly state the deadline is July 1, 2025. This error makes their reasoning and 5% forecast unreliable and I will largely disregard it.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 3%. After deliberation, I am updating my forecast slightly downward. Forecaster 2’s analysis reinforced my confidence in the primary arguments for a 'No' outcome. The barriers are significant and concrete: 1) Donald Trump's near-total absence from X is a massive obstacle. 2) Elon Musk is making a deliberate, observable effort to post less about U.S. politics. 3) The remaining timeframe of approximately five weeks is very short, making the status quo the most likely outcome. While both individuals are unpredictable, the combined weight of these factors is immense. Forecaster 2's slightly lower probability of 2% seems to better reflect the balance of these strong, evidence-based factors against the small, speculative possibility of a triggering event. I am therefore revising my forecast from 3% to 2% to align with this more rigorous weighting of the evidence.",
