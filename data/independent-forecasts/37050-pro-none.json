    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No company from the provided list is announced to be dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The S&P Dow Jones Indices' U.S. Index Committee makes no changes to the DJIA's composition during this short timeframe. No major unexpected corporate events, such as mergers, acquisitions, or significant restructurings, occur among the component companies that would force an immediate re-evaluation of the index.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major corporate event is announced involving one of the component companies, necessitating its removal. For example, a company facing significant headwinds like Boeing could announce a major restructuring, or a company like 3M could spin off a major division, prompting the Index Committee to announce a replacement to maintain the index's integrity and representation.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the historically low frequency of changes to the DJIA, especially within a very short timeframe of just over two months. The world changes slowly, and the composition of a major index like the Dow is a prime example of this inertia.\n\nFirst, the base rate of change is low. Changes are made on an 'as needed' basis, not on a regular schedule. While changes have occurred in recent years, there have been many multi-year periods with no changes at all. The probability of a change being announced in any specific two-month window is small.\n\nSecond, the short resolution window (until July 1, 2025) is the most critical factor. Index committee decisions of this magnitude are typically deliberative unless forced by a major corporate action (like a merger or spin-off). It is unlikely that a routine rebalancing, based on a company's declining relevance, would be initiated and announced within this specific, brief period without a significant catalyst.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 6% because there are a few companies on the list with specific, ongoing risk factors that could plausibly trigger a change. Boeing, for example, is navigating significant operational, legal, and reputational challenges, and an unexpected announcement regarding its corporate structure is a non-trivial possibility. Similarly, companies like 3M (facing large legal liabilities) or Verizon (a perennial underperformer with a low stock price) could be considered vulnerable over the medium term, and a sudden corporate event could accelerate their removal.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 6% because the bar for removal is very high, and the status quo is a powerful force. Most of the DJIA components are stable, blue-chip companies. A change requires a compelling reason, and in the absence of any current, credible rumors of M&A or other corporate actions (as confirmed by the research assistant's report of 'no additional information'), the most probable outcome is that the index remains unchanged in the immediate future.\n\nTo update my forecast higher, I would need to see credible reports of an imminent merger, acquisition, or significant restructuring involving a component company. To update lower, the passing of time until the deadline without any such news would gradually decrease the probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
