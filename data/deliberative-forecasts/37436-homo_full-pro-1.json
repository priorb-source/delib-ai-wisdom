    "review": "All three forecasters agree on the fundamental drivers pointing to a 'Yes' outcome: the current death toll of 295 is extremely close to the 300 threshold, the historical rate of casualties suggests the remaining five deaths will occur well before the July 1 deadline, and the current geopolitical context, particularly the reported plan to intensify military operations, increases the risk to UN personnel. The primary difference between our forecasts lies in the quantification of uncertainty. Forecaster 2's 90% estimate assigns a 10% chance to a sudden, durable ceasefire, which I believe is too high given the stated intent to escalate. Forecaster 3's analysis at 95% is more aligned with my own but introduces a crucial point I had not explicitly weighed: the possibility of a reporting lag by OCHA. This is a valid mechanism for a 'No' outcome, where fatalities could occur but not be officially confirmed and published by the deadline. Their reasoning on this point is convincing and highlights a source of uncertainty beyond just the chance of a ceasefire.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am making a slight downward adjustment to my forecast. My initial assessment of 98% was based primarily on the overwhelming likelihood of at least five more UN staff fatalities occurring and the extremely low probability of a sudden, durable ceasefire. I maintain this view. However, Forecaster 3's point about a potential 'significant lag in OCHA's reporting' introduces a valid, albeit small, source of uncertainty I had not fully accounted for. It is plausible that the 300th fatality occurs in late June but is not officially verified and included in the last OCHA snapshot before July 1. To incorporate this new consideration, I am reducing my forecast by two percentage points. This small adjustment reflects the addition of the reporting lag uncertainty to the minimal chance of a ceasefire. I remain more confident than my peers because the gap to the threshold is so small that the five additional deaths are likely to occur in May, leaving ample time for OCHA to report them, thus mitigating the risk of a last-minute reporting lag.",
