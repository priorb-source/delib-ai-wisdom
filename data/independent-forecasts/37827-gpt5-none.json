    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (until Metaculus checks on/after July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No pilot in Africa submits to NUFORC in June 2025, or any such submission isn’t tagged as a Pilot Report on NUFORC, is over international waters rather than within an African country, or is posted after July 1, 2025 and thus not visible at the required link when checked.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An airline or general-aviation pilot flying within an African country (e.g., Egypt, South Africa, Rwanda) observes unusual lights/objects in June 2025, files with NUFORC, the submission is categorized as a Pilot Report, and it is visible on NUFORC’s pilot-report index by July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: NUFORC receives most reports from the U.S.; international reports are less frequent, and African reports are rarer still. Pilot-designated reports are a small subset of total sightings. Combining these two filters (Africa AND Pilot) for a single-month window produces a low base rate. The Rwanda Jan 1, 2025 example shows NUFORC does carry African sightings, but it’s not necessarily a pilot report, so it doesn’t materially raise the base rate for this specific criterion. Timing risk: Even if a June event occurs and is submitted, NUFORC posting/labeling delays could push visibility past July 1, causing a No. This also nudges the probability down. Why not lower: Africa has substantial overflight by commercial aviation, and Starlink trains and other satellite/space phenomena can trigger pilot reports. It takes only one such incident. NUFORC does list pilot reports globally, so a non-zero chance in any given month exists. Why not higher: The conjunction of geography (Africa), reporter type (pilot), and tight timing (June, posted by July 1) is restrictive. Historically, months often pass without any African pilot reports on NUFORC. Update triggers: I would raise the forecast if (1) NUFORC shows an uptick in recent months’ pilot reports outside the U.S., (2) there are widely visible satellite trains or reentries forecast over African air routes in June, or (3) NUFORC indicates faster posting cadence. I would lower it if (1) NUFORC’s pilot-report index shows very few entries YTD 2025, (2) evidence indicates long posting lags beyond a month, or (3) aviation forums show pilots favoring other reporting channels for Africa. Research assistant provided no additional data beyond the Rwanda example, so this forecast leans on general base rates and constraints in the resolution criteria.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
