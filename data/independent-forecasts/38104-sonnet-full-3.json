  "information": "The escape from the Orleans Justice Center on May 16, 2025, involved ten inmates and went undetected for seven hours. The inmates created a hole in a wall behind a toilet, climbed out through a maintenance area, and used a mattress to get over a barbed-wire fence. An investigation revealed significant security flaws, including chronic understaffing, with the prison at only 60% of required staffing at the time. A federal monitor's report had previously warned of a deteriorated security situation, citing inmates' ability to manipulate cell locks. At least three jail employees have been arrested in connection with the escape, which the Orleans Parish Sheriff believes was an 'inside job' aided by staff.\n\nA multi-agency manhunt is underway, involving over 200 officers from local, state, and federal bodies, including the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The reward for information leading to the capture of the two remaining fugitives has been increased to $50,000 per person, with funds contributed by Crimestoppers, the FBI, and the ATF. As of late May 2025, law enforcement had received nearly 700 tips from the public. In connection with the escape and subsequent aid to the fugitives, at least 14 accomplices have been arrested, including family members of one of the escapees.\n\nAs of May 30, 2025, eight of the ten escapees have been recaptured. Some captures occurred out of state, including two inmates who were apprehended in Walker County, Texas, after a high-speed chase. The two fugitives still at large are Antoine Massey, 33, and Derrick Groves, 27, who are both considered armed and dangerous. Groves is a convicted murderer awaiting sentencing for a double homicide. Massey is described as a 'serial escapee' with three prior escapes from custody and was also being sought for kidnapping and rape. A former federal warden noted that Massey's housing in a first-floor cell was a significant security risk.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (from May 30, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - two fugitives remain at large",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the two remaining fugitives (Antoine Massey or Derrick Groves) successfully evades capture through July 1, 2025, either by fleeing to another country, finding secure hiding with accomplices who remain undetected, or avoiding the extensive manhunt through Massey's proven evasion skills from three prior escapes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Both Massey and Groves are captured or killed within the next 32 days. The intensive manhunt with 200+ officers, federal resources, $100,000 in total rewards, and nearly 700 tips continues to generate actionable leads that result in successful apprehension, similar to how the first eight escapees were caught.",
    "rationale": "The current status quo has two fugitives still at large after 14 days, which if unchanged would result in a No resolution. However, the manhunt has demonstrated strong effectiveness, recapturing 80% of escapees within two weeks through a multi-agency effort involving FBI, U.S. Marshals, ATF, and over 200 officers. Key positive factors include: substantial rewards ($50,000 per fugitive), nearly 700 tips received, 14 accomplices arrested (reducing support networks), successful out-of-state captures showing manhunt reach, and 32 days remaining for capture. Concerning factors include: Antoine Massey is a 'serial escapee' with three prior escapes, suggesting sophisticated evasion skills; both are armed, dangerous, and highly motivated to avoid capture; they've already evaded capture for two weeks; and the last fugitives often prove hardest to catch as they learn from others' mistakes. The question requires BOTH to be captured, making this a compound probability. If I estimate Massey at 65-70% individual capture probability (lower due to escape history) and Groves at 70-75%, the joint probability is approximately 50-60%. I weight toward the higher end (60%) because: the manhunt has proven effective, resources remain intensive, 32 days provides reasonable time, and accomplice arrests have disrupted support networks. My forecast is not higher because Massey's proven escape skills and the compound probability requirement create significant risk. It's not lower because the manhunt's track record, substantial resources, and adequate timeframe suggest better than even odds. I would update higher if new actionable intelligence emerges or if one fugitive is captured (dramatically increasing odds for the other). I would update lower if they remain at large beyond mid-June or if evidence suggests they've fled the country.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
