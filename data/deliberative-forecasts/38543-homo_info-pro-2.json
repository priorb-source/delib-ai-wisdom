    "review": "All three of us agree that the primary obstacle is the extremely short timeframe. However, Forecaster 3 introduced a crucial piece of new evidence that I had not considered: President Trump's confirmed travel schedule for the remainder of June, specifically the G7 Summit in Canada (June 16-18) and the NATO Summit in the Netherlands (June 24-25). This argument is highly convincing. It elevates the barrier from a general logistical difficulty to a specific, hard scheduling constraint, making a visit to China within the timeframe practically impossible. Forecaster 2's 5% seems too high in light of this schedule, as it appears to overweigh the possibility of an unconventional event against these concrete limitations. Forecaster 3's analysis, pointing out the non-existent window for travel, is the most compelling and has directly influenced my update.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 2% was based on the general logistical difficulty of arranging a presidential visit to China on such short notice. After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am updating my forecast. The new evidence provided by Forecaster 3 regarding President Trump's attendance at the G7 and NATO summits is a decisive factor. This packed international schedule creates an almost non-existent window for a trip to China, which would have to be squeezed between major engagements on two other continents. Such a trip is not just logistically hard; it's diplomatically and physically implausible. This specific, concrete evidence significantly strengthens the case for 'No' beyond my initial assessment. I am therefore lowering my forecast from 2% to 1%, aligning with Forecaster 3. The 1% probability is maintained to account for a 'black swan' event, such as a severe crisis requiring an unprecedented emergency meeting, but the combination of logistical hurdles and a packed schedule makes the baseline case for a visit before July 1 vanishingly small.",
