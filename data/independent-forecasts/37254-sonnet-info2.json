  "information": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued warnings that Russia may be preparing a new wave of aggression under the guise of the upcoming 'West-2025' military exercises in Belarus. The potential targets mentioned in these warnings include a further invasion of Ukraine, or an attack on Lithuania or Poland. Zelensky stated that intelligence reports indicate Russia is building up its military forces in Belarus, with as many as 150,000 soldiers, for a potential invasion of a NATO country. In response, Ukraine's State Border Guard Service is closely monitoring the border with Belarus and tracking the movement of Russian units.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Exactly 2 months (61 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Russia continues its military operations in Ukraine but does not invade any other country",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia conducts the West-2025 military exercises in Belarus as scheduled without launching any actual invasion. The military buildup remains for exercises or defensive posturing only. No ground forces enter another sovereign nation without consent, or if they do, the US does not publicly characterize it as an invasion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Russia uses the West-2025 exercises as cover to launch a surprise invasion of Lithuania, Poland, or potentially another neighbor. Russian ground forces cross the border without government consent, and the US State Department or White House immediately issues a public statement accusing Russia of invasion.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors no new invasion occurring in the next 2 months. Several factors support this: (1) Russia is heavily committed militarily and economically to the Ukraine conflict, making opening a second front extremely costly. (2) The most likely targets mentioned (Lithuania, Poland) are NATO members, and invading them would trigger Article 5, leading to direct war with NATO - an escalation Russia has carefully avoided despite rhetoric. (3) Belarus is already a close Russian ally under Lukashenko, so any Russian military presence there would likely have government consent, disqualifying it as an 'invasion.' (4) Historical base rates show major invasions are rare even for Russia, and the 2-month timeframe is very short for such a consequential action. The research assistant's report about Zelensky's warnings and the 150,000 troop buildup in Belarus does provide some signal, but requires careful interpretation - Ukrainian officials have strong incentives to maintain international alarm about Russian threats, and military exercises routinely involve large troop movements without leading to invasions. Why not lower (below 5%): Russia has previously surprised Western intelligence with invasions of Georgia and Ukraine, the intelligence reports shouldn't be completely dismissed, and there is documented military buildup. Why not higher (above 10%): The overwhelming constraints against such action (NATO deterrence, military overextension, economic costs), the very short 2-month window, and the strong status quo bias all argue against this scenario. I would update higher if: concrete intelligence emerges of Russian forces massing at non-Ukrainian borders, Russian rhetoric dramatically escalates with ultimatums, or NATO issues emergency warnings. I would update lower if: West-2025 exercises proceed normally, Russian forces reduce presence in Belarus, or diplomatic engagement increases.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the United States accuse Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News [Ukraine war: Which countries could Putin go for next? Is Europe vulnerable to a nuclear-armed bully?

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine, by Russia sending its ground military forces into that country without consent from the government of the country.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued warnings that Russia may be preparing a new wave of aggression under the guise of the upcoming 'West-2025' military exercises in Belarus.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
