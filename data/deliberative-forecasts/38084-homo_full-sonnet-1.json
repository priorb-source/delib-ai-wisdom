    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I had underemphasized. Forecaster 2 correctly highlights that June marks the beginning of California's dry season (June-September), not just that June is historically dry - this seasonal timing is crucial context. Both forecasters emphasize that U.S. Drought Monitor classifications use multiple slow-changing indicators (precipitation, streamflow, groundwater, reservoir levels), making rapid improvements difficult even with significant rainfall. Forecaster 2's calculation of the 13.5% buffer (2.7M / 20M) provides useful framing, though I note this represents only a 13.5% cushion above threshold. All three of us converge on key factors: NOAA's explicit forecast of drought persistence through August, the 30-day timeframe being insufficient for dramatic change, and skepticism about potential tropical storm relief. Their analyses are well-reasoned and systematic. However, I think there's a risk of anchoring too heavily on the current status quo. While drought classifications do change slowly, they DO update weekly (4-5 updates before resolution), and exceptional weather patterns can occur. The mention of potential widespread storm activity from Tropical Storm Alvin interacting with a low-pressure system, followed by Canadian trough bringing below-average temperatures and showers, represents genuine uncertainty that shouldn't be dismissed entirely. That said, their emphasis on seasonal timing and the multi-indicator nature of drought classifications strengthens the case for the Yes outcome more than I initially weighted.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should update my forecast upward but remain more conservative than Forecaster 2. The seasonal timing argument is particularly compelling - we're entering the dry season when natural precipitation is minimal, and the NOAA forecast explicitly predicting persistence through August directly encompasses our June 28 resolution date. The slow-changing nature of drought classifications, which aggregate multiple indicators over time, means even substantial rainfall would need sustained follow-through to move millions out of drought status within 30 days. However, I'm not going as high as 87% because: (1) weather systems do introduce meaningful uncertainty, especially with tropical storm activity mentioned; (2) the 13.5% buffer, while comfortable, is not enormous; (3) we'll have 4-5 weekly updates before resolution, providing multiple opportunities for classification changes; (4) unexpected weather patterns, while rare, do occur. The combination of official forecasts, seasonal patterns, short timeframe, and current buffer strongly favors Yes, but not so overwhelmingly as to justify 87%+. I'm updating to 83%, reflecting that the other forecasters' reasoning on seasonal timing and classification methodology is sound, while maintaining appropriate humility about weather uncertainty.",
