  "information": "The U.S. Treasury Department is currently using 'extraordinary measures' to continue financing the government without breaching the statutory debt limit. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has informed Congress that these measures can be sustained until June 27, 2025. Separately, the Bipartisan Policy Center projects that the 'X-date,' when the government would be at risk of default, will likely occur between mid-July and early October 2025. Following the previous debt ceiling suspension in June 2023, the reported debt figure increased by approximately $360 billion on the next business day and by a total of $600 billion within one week as inter-governmental trust funds were replenished.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — reported Total Public Debt Outstanding remains well below $37T by June 27 while the debt ceiling is binding.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Congress does not raise/suspend the debt limit before June 27. Treasury continues extraordinary measures, keeping reported Total Public Debt Outstanding pinned near the reinstated cap from early January 2025 (mid-$35T range), clearly under $37T.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Congress raises/suspends the debt limit very soon. Treasury rapidly replenishes deferred intragovernmental investments and rebuilds the cash balance (TGA) while issuing heavily. The reported debt jumps unusually fast; combined catch-up and issuance somehow push the total to ≥$37T by or just after June 27.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: The debt limit was reinstated on Jan 1–2, 2025, and Treasury has been using extraordinary measures since. The research assistant notes Secretary Yellen indicated these measures can last until June 27, and the Bipartisan Policy Center places the X-date between mid-July and early October. That implies the ceiling continues to bind through June 27 absent congressional action, keeping reported Total Public Debt Outstanding near the cap rather than rising freely. \n- Magnitude needed: Reaching $37T by June 27 would require the reported total to be roughly $1.5–$2.0T (or more) above where it is likely constrained today (mid-$35T). After the June 2023 suspension, the debt rose about $360B the next business day and about $600B within a week as intragovernmental accounts were replenished. Even with aggressive issuance and TGA rebuild, accumulating ≥$2T of additional reported debt within a few weeks would be unprecedented. \n- Timing: With only 23 days left, and June 27 itself cited as the outer limit for extraordinary measures, the window for a legislative resolution plus subsequent catch-up issuance is very short. If the dataset lacks a June 27 print and uses the first date after it, that adds at most one business day, which does not materially change the assessment. \nWhy not higher: A Yes would require both prompt congressional action and an exceptionally large, rapid increase in reported debt exceeding historical catch-up patterns by a wide margin. \nWhy not lower: There is some chance Congress acts well before June 27 and Treasury rebuilds the TGA aggressively, producing a larger-than-usual short-run jump. If current reported debt is already higher than assumed, or if Treasury signals an unusually large near-term cash rebuild, the probability would rise. \nUpdates: I would increase the probability if (1) Congress enacts a suspension/raise imminently; (2) Treasury indicates plans to rebuild the TGA by ~$1T+ by end-June; and/or (3) Debt to the Penny shows an immediate jump ≥$1T in the first week post-resolution. I would decrease it further if legislative negotiations stall past mid-June or if Debt to the Penny continues flat at the cap through mid/late June.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
