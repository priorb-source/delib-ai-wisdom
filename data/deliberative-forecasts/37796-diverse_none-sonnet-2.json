    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling arguments that strengthen the case for a higher probability. Forecaster 2's quantification of historical precedent (6 out of 7 recent plenaries with changes) is more concrete than my general statement and suggests an ~86% base rate. Their statistical framing is particularly strong: the Yes outcome requires only that either removals OR additions occur, while No requires both zero removals from 25 jurisdictions AND zero additions from ongoing evaluations - a compound probability that should be quite low.\n\nForecaster 3's pipeline considerations add useful texture, though they arrive at a more cautious 85%. Their mention of potential delays to October and the importance of on-site visit timing provides reasonable grounds for not going too high.\n\nThe most important new information is the June 2024 precedent of no changes, which both forecasters acknowledge. This recent counterexample suggests the pattern isn't as uniform as 'almost always,' and specifically demonstrates that June plenaries can result in status quo outcomes. This tempers the case for extremely high confidence.\n\nAll three of us lack specific intelligence about which jurisdictions are near completion of their action plans - a key information gap that limits confidence in forecasts above 85-90%.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating upward but remaining more conservative than Forecaster 2. The historical base rate of 6/7 plenaries with changes is stronger evidence than I initially weighted, and the statistical argument about requiring both zero removals AND zero additions is compelling with 25 jurisdictions under monitoring.\n\nHowever, several factors support staying below 90%: (1) June 2024's no-change outcome is a recent, relevant counterexample showing that even with strong historical patterns, the specific timing matters; (2) Only 4 months have elapsed since February 2025's changes, which is a relatively short window for jurisdictions to complete comprehensive reforms; (3) None of us have concrete intelligence about specific jurisdictions nearing delisting or new candidates for addition.\n\nThe question's low bar (any single change qualifies as Yes) combined with the large pool of monitored jurisdictions and continuous evaluation process creates strong structural reasons to expect change. But the June 2024 precedent and short time window since the last update provide meaningful downside risk.\n\nI'm updating from 75% to 82%, reflecting increased confidence from the better-quantified historical evidence while maintaining appropriate caution given the recent counterexample and information gaps.",
