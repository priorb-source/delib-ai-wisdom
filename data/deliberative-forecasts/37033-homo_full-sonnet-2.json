    "review": "Both forecasters raise valuable points. Forecaster 2's observation about the potential pivot to treasury bonds (since 99% of compensation is designated for bonds, not cash) is particularly important and something I underweighted. This suggests the government may have fulfilled its immediate cash payment obligation and could now shift to bond issuance, which wouldn't count as another payment under the question criteria.\n\nForecaster 3's emphasis on the February 2025 payment to European farmers as an additional momentum indicator is well-taken - this provides a second recent data point beyond April 9, showing broader commitment to land compensation. The point about small payment sizes ($3.1M) allowing multiple disbursements from the remaining $6.9M also has merit.\n\nHowever, I find Forecaster 3's 48% forecast too optimistic given that just 14 days have passed since the first payment. Administrative cycles, even with frameworks in place, typically don't operate that quickly in resource-constrained governments. Forecaster 2's 32% aligns more closely with my reasoning about the slow historical pace and status quo inertia.\n\nThe strongest argument for a higher forecast is the dual momentum from February and April payments combined with strategic pressure for sanctions relief. The strongest argument for a lower forecast is the treasury bonds alternative and the very recent timing of the April payment.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating slightly upward from 35% to 37%. The February payment data point does strengthen the case for continued momentum, and Forecaster 3 correctly notes that small payment amounts could enable multiple disbursements. However, Forecaster 2's treasury bonds argument is compelling - the agreement structure suggests the government may now transition to bond issuance rather than additional cash payments.\n\nThe core tension remains: 38 days provides sufficient time theoretically, but only 14 days have elapsed since the first payment after years of delays. While the strategic importance for debt restructuring is high, the severe economic crisis ($21 billion debt, drought, food insecurity) creates real constraints. The lack of any announced payment schedule or timeline for the next disbursement is telling.\n\nI'm not moving to 48% because: (1) the treasury bonds alternative reduces the probability of near-term cash payments, (2) administrative processing after such a recent payment is unlikely within 5 weeks, and (3) economic constraints remain severe. I'm moving slightly above my original 35% to acknowledge the February payment momentum and the validity of multiple small disbursements being possible from remaining funds.",
