  "information": "In January 2025, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney described independence as an 'urgent priority'. However, former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated in the same month that a referendum was 'off the radar' for now and unlikely before the 2030s. More recent government announcements in April 2025 indicate a strategic focus on the economy, child poverty, and public services. The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has stated his party will not support an independence referendum during the next Holyrood term, regardless of the 2026 election outcome. The leader of the Alba Party, Kenny MacAskill, has suggested using the May 2026 Holyrood elections as a direct mandate for negotiating independence rather than holding a separate referendum.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Scottish government continues its focus on domestic policy and does not announce a referendum date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish government remains focused on its stated priorities of the economy and public services, viewing the upcoming 2026 Holyrood election as the next key milestone for the independence cause. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without any official announcement of a referendum date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to a sudden and dramatic surge in public support for independence, or due to intense internal party pressure, First Minister John Swinney makes a surprise announcement scheduling a referendum. This move would be intended to energize the pro-independence base and re-frame the political debate ahead of the 2026 elections.",
    "rationale": "The probability of an announcement is very low due to the extremely short timeframe of less than two months. The status quo, which is the most likely outcome, is that no date will be announced. My rationale is primarily based on the Scottish government's own stated priorities from April 2025, which focus on the economy, poverty, and public services, not on an imminent referendum. This aligns with former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's influential view that a referendum is 'off the radar' for now. While First Minister John Swinney called independence an 'urgent priority' in January, the government's subsequent actions suggest this was rhetorical rather than a signal of an impending announcement. The political focus for all parties, including pro-independence ones like Alba, appears to be on the 2026 Holyrood elections, not on a referendum before then. My forecast is not lower than 5% because surprise political announcements are always possible, and the First Minister has the authority to make one if he perceives a strategic advantage. It is not higher because the overwhelming weight of evidence—including government focus, key political figures' statements, and the limited timeframe—points strongly against it. I would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of an impending announcement or if a major political event caused a sustained spike in independence support. I would decrease it if the First Minister explicitly ruled out an announcement in this period.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn January 2025, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney described independence as an 'urgent priority'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
