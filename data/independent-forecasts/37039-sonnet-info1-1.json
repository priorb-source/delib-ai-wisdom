  "information": "On April 2-3, 2025, the U.S. President announced comprehensive tariffs. The policy included a 10% base tariff on goods from almost all countries, effective April 5, and additional country-specific tariffs to take effect on April 9. For Switzerland, the total tariff was set at 31%. The stated justifications included that Switzerland had been 'taking advantage' of the US and as a response to alleged 61% tariffs imposed by Switzerland on American products.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "38 days (from April 24, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the 31% tariff on Switzerland is already in effect as of April 9, 2025, and would remain in place",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Switzerland successfully negotiates a trade agreement with the US that results in the 31% tariff being reduced, suspended, or removed before June 1. Alternatively, the Trump administration unilaterally modifies the tariff policy in response to diplomatic pressure, economic considerations, or domestic political factors.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The 31% tariff remains in effect through June 1, 2025 without modification. No successful trade negotiations occur, and the administration maintains its tariff policy despite any Swiss objections or diplomatic efforts.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report indicates that the 31% tariff on Switzerland was announced April 2-3 and took effect April 9, 2025, meaning it has already been in place for approximately 15 days. The status quo principle strongly favors the tariff remaining in effect - governments rarely reverse major trade policies within weeks of implementation. With only 38 days remaining until the resolution date, there is limited time for significant policy changes. However, several factors prevent me from assigning a probability above 80%: (1) tariffs are frequently subject to negotiation and modification, especially early in their implementation; (2) Switzerland, as a wealthy trading partner, has significant leverage for negotiations; (3) the Trump administration has historically shown willingness to quickly modify tariff policies based on negotiations; (4) the specific technical requirement of checking the harmonized tariff schedule could be affected by administrative delays or technical issues. My forecast would increase if we get closer to June 1 without any announced negotiations or policy reviews. It would decrease if Switzerland announces formal trade talks with the US or if there are reports of the administration considering modifications to its tariff policy. A probability around 78% reflects strong confidence in the status quo while acknowledging meaningful uncertainty from potential diplomatic or policy changes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tariff schedule list the tariff on Switzerland as 31% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Swiss Indignant to Make the Top 10 of Trump’s Tariffs List](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/trump-tariffs-switzerland.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 31% for Switzerland at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=switzerland) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this question is asking whether the cell in the 'RATES OF DUTY' column '1, General' appearing alongside subheading 9903.01.60 on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule indicates an additional ad valorem duty rate of 31% for articles the product of Switzerland, regardless of any specificities noted in the 'Article Description' column.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn April 2-3, 2025, the U.S. President announced comprehensive tariffs.

The stated justifications included that Switzerland had been 'taking advantage' of the US and as a response to alleged 61% tariffs imposed by Switzerland on American products.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
