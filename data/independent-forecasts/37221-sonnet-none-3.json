    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-7 days. April 2025 Eurozone inflation data is typically released by Eurostat in the first week of May, so we should know the outcome by early May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - inflation remains at or below 2.2%. The status quo based on the February 2025 downward revisions suggests a continued disinflationary trend, with inflation likely hovering near the ECB's 2% target.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The disinflationary trend from February continues into April, with inflation settling between 1.8% and 2.2%. This could result from stable energy prices, moderate economic growth, continued effects of ECB monetary tightening, and easing wage pressures. Supply chains remain normalized and there are no significant price shocks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April sees an unexpected uptick in inflation above 2.2%, potentially driven by rising energy prices (particularly oil or gas), stronger-than-expected wage growth feeding into services inflation, supply disruptions, or a weaker euro increasing import prices. Base effects from low readings in April 2024 could also push the year-over-year rate higher.",
    "rationale": "The February downward revisions mentioned in the background suggest inflation was trending lower than expected, indicating disinflationary momentum. The ECB has been successfully bringing inflation down from 2022-2023 peaks toward its 2% target. The threshold of 2.2% represents only a modest deviation above target - just 20 basis points - which means we're essentially asking if inflation will be marginally above target rather than at or slightly below it. Given the recent downward trend and the ECB's ongoing policy stance, the base case favors inflation remaining close to or at target. However, there's meaningful uncertainty because: (1) we lack March 2025 data that would show the most recent trend, (2) monthly inflation can be volatile due to energy prices and seasonal factors, and (3) we're forecasting what has essentially already occurred but not yet been reported. The forecast isn't higher because the stated trend is downward and there's no evidence of inflationary pressures accelerating. It isn't lower because 2.2% is very close to target, monthly volatility exists, and there's always possibility of unexpected price movements. I would update higher with evidence of March inflation accelerating, energy price spikes, or stronger wage growth. I would update lower with preliminary April data showing continued cooling or if March came in well below 2%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Euro Area Inflation Rate be above 2.2% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nEuro News: [Euro falls as eurozone inflation sees downward revisions in February](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/03/19/euro-falls-as-eurozone-inflation-sees-downward-revisions-in-february)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Eurozone inflation rate for April 2025 is above 2.2% on an annualized basis according to [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
