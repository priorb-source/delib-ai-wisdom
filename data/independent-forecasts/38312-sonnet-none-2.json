    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. G7 Summits typically occur mid-to-late June, and today is June 3, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Modi does not attend. As of the most recent reporting, India has not been invited to the G7 Summit despite Canada extending invitations to other non-G7 countries like Australia and Ukraine.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Canada does not extend an invitation to India due to ongoing diplomatic tensions between the two countries (related to Sikh separatism issues and the Nijjar affair). Alternatively, India receives a last-minute invitation but Modi declines or cannot adjust his schedule on such short notice.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Canada extends a last-minute invitation to India in the coming days, possibly due to diplomatic pressure from other G7 members or a desire to maintain India as a strategic partner. Modi accepts and his schedule permits attendance at the summit.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome. India has not been invited despite Canada already inviting other non-G7 outreach partners. This is notable because India has been a regular participant in recent G7 summits (UK 2021, Germany 2022, Japan 2023). The absence of an invitation likely reflects deteriorating Canada-India relations following the 2023 Nijjar killing and subsequent diplomatic expulsions. The timing is critical - it's already June 3rd, leaving only 2-3 weeks before a typical mid-June summit. Even if an invitation were extended now, the logistical and diplomatic preparations would be extremely rushed. My forecast is not lower (perhaps 5-10%) because diplomatic situations can shift rapidly and there remains technical possibility of a last-minute invitation. My forecast is not higher (perhaps 30-40%) because the combination of no current invitation, very limited time, and apparent diplomatic tensions makes attendance unlikely. I would update higher if news emerged of an invitation or positive diplomatic signals. I would update lower if the summit guest list were officially announced without India or if Indian officials stated they would not attend.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill India's PM Narendra Modi attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of India: [Canada invites Australia, Ukraine for G7 meet but no call for India yet](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-invites-australia-ukraine-for-g7-meet-but-no-call-for-india-yet/articleshow/121398906.cms)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
