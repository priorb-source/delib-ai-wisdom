    "review": "My initial forecast of 10% was aligned with Forecaster 3's. Forecaster 2 presented a more optimistic 25% forecast, which I found valuable. Their key arguments—that the military's national security framing could override political directives and that installation resilience is more politically defensible than general climate policy—were compelling points that I had perhaps underweighted. Forecaster 3 provided an excellent technical analysis I had missed, noting two key things: 1) the resolution mechanism itself (IsItDownRightNow) could fail or be blocked by .mil security, creating a new path to a 'No' outcome, and 2) a simple redirect of the climate.mil domain to a rebranded 'resilience' page would be a low-effort, bureaucratic way to achieve a 'Yes' resolution without a direct policy confrontation. This 'redirect' scenario is a highly plausible path to 'Yes' that I had not considered.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 10% to 15%. The deliberation introduced two significant, opposing factors. Pushing the probability down is Forecaster 3's point about the fragility of the resolution mechanism; if IsItDownRightNow is blocked from accessing the domain for security reasons, the question resolves No even if the site is available. Pushing the probability up are two stronger considerations. First, as Forecaster 2 argued, the Department of Defense has a unique institutional imperative and may have more leeway to restore a tool it deems critical for national security, regardless of the administration's broader political stance. Second, and most persuasively, Forecaster 3's identification of a simple redirect as a plausible path to 'Yes' is key. This action represents a bureaucratic middle ground: it avoids the political sensitivity of the word 'climate' while still making the resource available and resolving the technical issue of a dead domain. This seems more likely than a full restoration but would still trigger a 'Yes' resolution. Weighing these factors, the credible 'redirect' scenario and a greater appreciation for the DoD's potential autonomy slightly outweigh the new downside risk of the resolution mechanism. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast by 5 percentage points to reflect a slightly higher, though still small, chance of the portal being accessible by the deadline.",
