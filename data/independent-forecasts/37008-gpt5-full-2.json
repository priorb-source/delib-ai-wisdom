  "information": "A state of emergency was declared in Samoa on March 31, 2025, due to a severe energy crisis. The declaration was scheduled to be in effect for 30 days, from April 1, 2025, through April 29, 2025.\n\nAccording to reports from Samoa NewsHub and the Samoa Observer, temporary generators were expected to be operational by the end of April, coinciding with the scheduled end of the state of emergency. However, the permanent solution to the power crisis is not anticipated to be in place until August 2025.\n\nAs of April 21, 2025, the Samoan government had not announced any plans to extend the state of emergency. The National Emergency Operation Centre's update on April 15 confirmed that emergency orders were valid until April 29. The crisis has had a significant economic impact, estimated at a 16% hit to the country's GDP.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the current emergency order is scheduled to lapse on April 29, 2025, and would not be in effect on April 30 absent an extension or a new declaration.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Temporary generators come online on schedule by late April, load shedding eases, and the government lets the emergency expire on April 29 without renewal.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The government issues an extension (e.g., another 7–30 days) because generator deployment slips, grid stability remains uncertain, or rationing/enforcement needs continue into early May; alternatively, a separate emergency (e.g., severe weather) is declared covering April 30.",
    "rationale": "What I know: A state of emergency was declared March 31 for the power crisis, in force April 1–29. As of April 21, officials had not signaled an extension; NEOC said orders are valid to April 29. Temporary generators were expected by end-April, with a permanent fix not until August. The crisis is economically significant (estimated 16% GDP impact), which could argue for caution and a short extension if the temporary solution is not fully stable by month-end.\n\nBase/Status quo: Without a new proclamation, the emergency ends Apr 29, implying No on Apr 30. Governments often announce extensions close to expiry, but the public guidance currently points to lapse on schedule. I therefore anchor on No as the default.\n\nReasons for a higher-than-zero chance of Yes: Project slippage and commissioning delays are common, and authorities may prefer a buffer to manage load shedding and compliance as generators are integrated. If any hiccup occurs around delivery, testing, or fuel logistics, a brief extension covering Apr 30 is likely. There is also a small chance of an unrelated emergency (e.g., late-season cyclone), though that base rate is low.\n\nWhy not higher: Current official messaging limits orders to Apr 29, and temporary capacity is targeted for end-April. There’s no public indication (as of Apr 21) of intent to extend, and governments often prefer to exit emergency footing once a stopgap is ready.\n\nWhy not lower: The system remains fragile until temporary units are online and proven. Given the severity of the outages and economic hit, a precautionary extension into early May is plausible if readiness is marginal. Extensions, when they happen, typically cover at least several days, which would include Apr 30.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of delays in generator arrival/installation, continuing unplanned outages near Apr 27–29, or any official hint NEOC/Cabinet will extend. What would move me down: Confirmation that temporary generators are installed, tested, fueled, and handling load before Apr 28, or an explicit government statement that the emergency will lapse without renewal.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
