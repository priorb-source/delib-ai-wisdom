    "status_quo_outcome": "No win (most nominees in each category do not win; beating strong, core-country competitors is hard)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "He goes 0-for-4: categories break toward core country favorites (e.g., Lainey Wilson, Chris Stapleton, Luke Combs, Zach Bryan). Voters shy away from a pop-to-country crossover and/or a collaboration featuring Morgan Wallen, or momentum consolidates around other songs/albums.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He wins at least one of his four nominated categories, most plausibly tied to his major crossover hit collaboration, or a collaboration/video/event-style category where commercial impact is heavily rewarded.",
    "rationale": "With four nominations, Post Malone’s chance of collecting at least one win is meaningfully above a single-category base rate. The ACMs are generally friendly to commercially dominant records, and his 2024–25 country collaborations were among the biggest hits of the year. A rough, back-of-the-envelope approach: if each category win chance were in the 20–35% range and independent, the chance of at least one win would be 60–70%+. Because outcomes are correlated (if voters prefer more traditional acts this year, he can miss across the board), I discount that to the low 60s. Why not higher: very strong competition from core-country stars, potential voter hesitancy toward a high-profile crossover, and correlation risk across his nominations. Why not lower: four shots on goal, massive commercial footprint, and ACMs’ track record of rewarding big hits make a clean sweep of losses less likely. I have no additional intel from the research assistant beyond the fact of four nominations. I would update upward with signals that industry voters view his collaboration as the consensus pick (e.g., pre-ceremony awards, credible forecasting markets, or insider reporting), strong promotional positioning (featured performance buzz), or indications of category fields that split rivals. I would move downward if pre-award chatter or early-announced winners show a sweep toward core-country favorites, or if credible reports suggest a backlash against crossover wins.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Post Malone win an award at the 60th Academy of Country Music Awards?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe awards are scheduled to be held on May 8, 2025. Malone has 4 nominations.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Post Malone wins an award at the [60th Academy of Country Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_Academy_of_Country_Music_Awards).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
