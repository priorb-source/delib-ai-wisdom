    "review": "Forecaster 2 rightly emphasizes that dual naming would satisfy the criterion and that WorldAtlas already uses “(Gulf of America)” in the article title—both lower the bar relative to a full rename. However, I think they overinterpret the article title as a strong signal of intent for map-wide changes; it can just as easily be an SEO/editorial hedge. Forecaster 3’s focus on the four-month lag since the EO and the continued absence of a change on the North America map is a meaningful indicator of institutional caution and aligns with WorldAtlas’s likely preference for internationally recognized names. I also find persuasive the points about WorldAtlas being Canadian-based, IHO non-recognition, and Mexico’s opposition. The note that 54 days remain is relevant, and the impending hurricane season could nudge updates, but I still see the base inertia as dominant. Overall, I find Forecaster 3 more convincing than Forecaster 2, though I acknowledge the dual-name path is a live possibility.",
    "rationale": "Key considerations remain: (1) institutional inertia and international standards (IHO) favor retaining “Gulf of Mexico,” especially for a Canadian publisher with a global audience; (2) controversy with Mexico/Cuba reduces incentives to adopt a unilateral U.S. naming on a general reference map; (3) WorldAtlas already accommodated the term in the specific article title, which could be their compromise without revising static map assets on the North America page; (4) the resolution criterion allows dual naming, which is technically easy to satisfy if they choose to update the page text or map label; (5) external signals are mixed—U.S. agencies and Google (U.S. view) use “Gulf of America,” but major global publishers and the IHO have not followed. The four-month delay since the EO without a North America page change slightly reinforces a No baseline. Countervailing factors include the start of Atlantic hurricane season (June 1) and the possibility of a small editorial tweak to add dual naming to the landing page. Balancing these, I make a slight upward adjustment to reflect the non-zero chance of a pre-hurricane-season refresh or consistency push across related pages, but inertia still dominates.",
