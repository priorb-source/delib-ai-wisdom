    "review": "All three forecasters converged remarkably on the 65-68% range, which strengthens my confidence that this probability band is appropriate. We all identified the same key factors: (1) 30-day timeframe favoring status quo persistence, (2) June being California's dry season, (3) 20M representing ~50% of state population - substantial but achievable, (4) critical lack of current baseline data. Forecaster 3 raised a good point about 'already bad' being subjective - it could describe severity relative to recent years without necessarily meaning 20M+ residents are currently affected. Forecaster 2's explicit acknowledgement of rare June weather events as a theoretical mitigating factor was useful, though we all implicitly recognized this low probability. The convergence itself is informative but doesn't fundamentally change my analysis since no new substantive evidence was introduced.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I maintain that 65-68% is the appropriate range. The key insight from deliberation is that our uncertainty stems primarily from lacking baseline data - we don't know if current conditions affect 10M, 15M, or 19M residents. The article's 'already bad' characterization is encouraging for a Yes outcome, but could be relative rather than absolute. The 30-day window during California's driest season strongly favors persistence, and three independent analyses reaching near-identical conclusions validates this weighting. However, I'm mindful that 'already bad' doesn't guarantee we're at the threshold - drought could be severe in affected areas while still impacting fewer than 20M residents if concentrated in less populated regions. The slight upward pressure comes from the consensus and the very strong seasonal timing argument, but I'm resisting overconfidence given the complete absence of current quantitative data. I'll adjust slightly upward to 66% to reflect the convergence while acknowledging the fundamental uncertainty about baseline conditions.",
