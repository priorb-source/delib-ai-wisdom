    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks. The US Census Bureau typically releases trade data for a given month about 6 weeks after month-end, so April 2025 data should be published around mid-June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Under normal conditions, US exports would show modest year-over-year growth of 2-5%, which would result in April 2025 exports exceeding the $262.578 billion threshold from April 2024. However, the current environment is not normal due to the tariff situation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs trigger widespread retaliatory measures from major trading partners (EU, China, Canada, Mexico). These retaliatory tariffs reduce demand for US goods, particularly in key export sectors like agriculture, manufacturing, and energy. The trade war creates economic uncertainty that dampens global trade flows, and US exports either decline year-over-year or grow insufficiently to exceed the threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the tariff announcements, April 2025 exports exceed the threshold due to: (1) front-loading effects as companies rush to export before full retaliation materializes, (2) a lag between tariff announcements and implementation of retaliatory measures, (3) strong underlying global demand that partially offsets trade tensions, or (4) dollar weakness making US exports more competitive in certain markets.",
    "rationale": "The critical factor is the timing and impact of Trump's tariffs. The reference to 'liberation day' tariffs suggests significant trade policy actions, likely including broad-based tariffs that would provoke retaliation. Historical precedent from 2018-2019 shows that tariffs do negatively impact US exports, but effects take time to fully materialize. If tariffs were announced in early April or late March 2025, April trade data might not yet reflect the full negative impact of retaliation. There could even be short-term positive effects from exporters front-loading shipments. However, if tariffs were announced earlier (January-March), April would show clearer negative effects. The baseline expectation would be modest growth (2-5% annually), which would easily clear the threshold. At $262.578 billion, we'd need April 2025 to reach approximately $268-275 billion for typical growth rates. The tariff headwinds create significant downside risk to this baseline. The probability is not higher because: (1) trade wars historically reduce exports, (2) retaliation from major partners is likely, and (3) economic uncertainty dampens trade. The probability is not lower because: (1) April may be too early for full effects to materialize, (2) front-loading could temporarily boost numbers, and (3) some sectors may remain resilient. I would revise upward if evidence emerged of limited retaliation or strong March/early April export numbers. I would revise downward if data showed rapid implementation of retaliatory tariffs or early indicators of export weakness.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US exports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of exports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 262,578 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
