    "review": "My initial forecast of 3% was the most conservative of the group. Both other forecasters, at 7% and 5%, presented similar reasoning regarding the significant barriers to a 'Yes' resolution, such as the short timeline and legal hurdles. However, they placed more weight on the possibility of a purely political or symbolic announcement. The argument I found most compelling, raised by Forecaster 3, was the direct precedent from 2022, when the Scottish Government announced a specific referendum date despite the legal uncertainty and opposition from Westminster. This demonstrates a clear willingness to undertake the exact action required for a 'Yes' resolution as a political strategy. Forecaster 2 also rightly pointed out that announcing a date far in the future carries little immediate practical cost, reinforcing the plausibility of such a symbolic gesture. These arguments collectively convinced me that my initial assessment underweighted this 'political gambit' scenario.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 3% to 5%. My initial analysis focused heavily on the numerous practical, legal, and political obstacles which make an announcement highly improbable, and these factors remain valid. However, the deliberation highlighted a key piece of evidence I had underweighted: the Scottish Government's past behavior. As Forecaster 3 noted, a date for a referendum was previously announced in 2022 under similar conditions of legal uncertainty. This precedent establishes that the current ruling party is willing to use such an announcement as a political tool to rally supporters and apply pressure, even if the path to a legally binding referendum is blocked. While the current government's stated focus on domestic policy and the very short timeline still make this an unlikely event, the demonstrated history of this specific tactic makes a repeat more plausible than I had originally estimated. I am aligning with Forecaster 3's 5% as it appropriately balances the strong baseline case for 'No' with the non-trivial possibility of a symbolic political announcement based on historical precedent.",
