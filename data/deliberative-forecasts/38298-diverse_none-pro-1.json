    "review": "My initial forecast (35%) was primarily driven by the expected transition from a strong El Niño to an ENSO-neutral or La Niña state by May 2025, which I believed would create a significant headwind against setting a new record. Forecaster 2 (45%) shared similar reasoning, emphasizing the high bar set by the previous record and natural variability, but placed slightly more weight on the recent base rate of record-breaking months.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis (75%) was the most impactful on my thinking. I found their two central arguments highly convincing and believe I had underweighting them. First is the lagged effect of the 2023-24 El Niño; the peak atmospheric warming often occurs several months after the peak oceanic signal, meaning May 2025 could still be experiencing the full thermal impact. Second is the persistence of exceptionally high ocean heat content and sea-surface temperatures, which provides a very high baseline temperature for the globe regardless of the instantaneous ENSO state. These two factors strongly suggest that the 'status quo' is one of extreme, persistent warmth. While I find Forecaster 3's 75% a bit too high given the inherent variability and the difficulty of clearing an already-high record, their core logic has persuaded me to substantially revise my forecast upwards.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am increasing my forecast from 35% to 60%. My initial forecast disproportionately focused on the waning El Niño as a primary driver for temperatures to fall below record levels. Forecaster 3's compelling arguments about the thermal inertia of the climate system have convinced me to revise this view. The key factors are the lagged atmospheric response to El Niño, which can peak well into the following year, and the persistence of record-high ocean heat content acting as a powerful floor for global temperatures.\n\nThese factors make it substantially more likely that the warmth from the 2023-24 event will carry over and, when combined with the underlying long-term warming trend, will be sufficient to push May 2025 to a new record. I am moving my forecast from 'unlikely' to 'more likely than not'.\n\nI am not moving higher, toward Forecaster 3's 75%, because the record set in May 2024 (presumably during the prior El Niño event) will be an exceptionally high bar to clear. Natural variability and the gradual shift away from peak El Niño conditions still introduce significant uncertainty, making a 'miss' (i.e., ranking 2nd or 3rd warmest) a very plausible outcome. My new forecast of 60% reflects the now-favored chance of a new record while still respecting these considerable mitigating factors.",
