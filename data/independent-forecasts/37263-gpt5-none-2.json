    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "TCI maintains current restrictions on ride‑sharing/“illegal taxis,” taxi associations oppose entry, and Uber is not added to Uber’s ‘Where we operate’ listings nor reported by credible local media as launched.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Uber rolls out an ‘Uber Taxi’ model in Turks and Caicos using licensed taxis (or a government‑sanctioned pilot). Uber updates its website to list TCI, and local authorities or reputable media announce the launch before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo: Uber does not currently operate in the Turks and Caicos Islands, and recent local reporting highlights government warnings against illegal taxis. That suggests a protective regulatory posture toward the existing taxi sector. In small island markets (e.g., Bermuda, Cayman), ride‑sharing often faces bans or strict limits; TCI appears similar.\n- Timeframe: Only ~2 months remain. Launches typically involve regulatory clearance, local partnerships, and public communications. That is short for reversing or reinterpreting rules in a politically sensitive sector.\n- Market size and prioritization: TCI’s small population and heavy reliance on licensed taxis make it a lower priority for Uber relative to larger markets, further reducing near‑term odds.\n- Path to Yes: A limited ‘Uber Taxi’ partnership using licensed taxis could be fast if politically endorsed, which keeps probability above zero. Uber has used this model in some Caribbean markets (e.g., Jamaica) after government engagement.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information available; no signals of imminent launch.\n- Why not higher: Regulatory headwinds, entrenched taxi interests, lack of any public signals, and a very short timeline.\n- Why not lower: Uber could negotiate a rapid, government‑sanctioned taxi integration and flip the switch quickly.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of policy change, an MoU with taxi associations, Uber job postings or press materials specific to TCI, or Uber’s site listing TCI. What would move me down: Official statements reaffirming prohibition, enforcement crackdowns, or explicit government rejection of ride‑sharing pilots.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Uber be available in the Turks and Caicos Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tourism Stakeholders Warned About Encouraging Use of Illegal Taxis](https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/tourism-stakeholders-warned-about-encouraging-use-of-illegal-taxis/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Uber is available in Turks and Caicos as shown on the [Uber website](https://www.uber.com/us/en/search-results/?query=TURKS+AND+CAICOS) or according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
