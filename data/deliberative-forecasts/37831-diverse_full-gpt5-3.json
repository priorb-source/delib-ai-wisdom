    "review": "Both forecasters make persuasive points about the short timeline and the regime’s consolidation logic. Forecaster 2 adds the signaling-cost argument (a reversal would display weakness), and conditions for an update (elite split, massive protests, or pressure from key partners like Russia/China). Forecaster 3 quantifies the time constraint (about 40 days) and underscores the improbability of swift judicial relief in a military regime. Neither adds concrete evidence of impending reversal; both strengthen the base-rate case against quick backtracking. They don’t address the resolution nuance that a rapid new party law could implicitly reverse the decree’s effects if it reinstates multiparty politics, but even that seems unlikely on this timeline.",
    "rationale": "My prior 12% leaned on a face‑saving pivot: rescind/replace the decree quickly with a stringent new party law that still allows formation of parties, satisfying the resolution criteria. The deliberation highlights two underweighted factors: (1) reversal within weeks would carry high internal signaling costs for the junta; (2) courts are unlikely to act swiftly or independently enough to force change by July 1. External leverage remains weak (Mali’s distance from ECOWAS; likely tolerance from key security partners). Given these, I trim the probability. I keep a non‑trivial tail for a tactical climbdown if protests scale unexpectedly, a surprising court move occurs, or the junta opts for rapid “rationalization” via a new law that explicitly restores party formation. Net: modest downward adjustment.",
