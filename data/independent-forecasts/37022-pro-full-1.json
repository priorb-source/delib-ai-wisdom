  "information": "The latest published value for Ukraine's government debt for February 2025 was 1.869 trillion UAH. The threshold for the question to resolve as 'Yes' is 1.900 trillion UAH, necessitating a month-on-month increase of at least 30.5 billion UAH. Historical data from 2024-2025 shows that the typical monthly net change in debt ranged from a decrease of 10 billion UAH to an increase of 110 billion UAH. The median monthly increase during this period was approximately 25 billion UAH, and the increase from January to February 2025 was 18.5 billion UAH. In seven of the twelve months preceding March 2025, the monthly increase was 30 billion UAH or greater.\n\nIn mid-March 2025, Ukraine received a disbursement from an IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) tranche amounting to $400 million, which is equivalent to approximately 16 billion UAH. Furthermore, the first tranche of EU ERA loans, valued at €1 billion, was expected in late March. Domestic bond auctions have continued to raise approximately 26 billion UAH per month. Debt servicing costs for March were reported to be modest.\n\nBy the end of 2024, Ukraine's total state debt had reached approximately 7 trillion UAH, equivalent to about 92% of the country's GDP. The state budget for 2024 operated with a significant deficit, and the Accounting Chamber of Ukraine reported a 29% increase in tax debt during that year. During March 2025, the Ukrainian hryvnia weakened from 41.1 to 41.4 UAH/USD. This 0.7% depreciation increased the UAH valuation of Ukraine's foreign-currency denominated debt by an estimated 9-11 billion UAH.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. Data for March 2025 is expected to be published by the resolution source shortly.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Ukraine's government debt has been on a steep upward trajectory due to the ongoing war and reliance on foreign and domestic borrowing to finance its budget deficit. A continued increase in line with recent trends would push the debt past the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "For the outcome to be 'No', the net increase in debt during March 2025 would need to be less than 31 billion UAH. This could only occur if multiple expected major loan disbursements from the IMF and EU were unexpectedly delayed to April, combined with an unusually large principal repayment on existing debt during March.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The debt surpasses 1.90 trillion UAH, driven by planned inflows of capital. Ukraine receives a new IMF tranche and conducts successful domestic bond auctions. Furthermore, a weakening of the Hryvnia during March increases the value of foreign-currency denominated debt in local currency terms, contributing to the overall increase.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on a quantitative analysis of the factors affecting Ukraine's debt in March 2025. The debt at the end of February 2025 was 1.869 trillion UAH, requiring a net increase of 31 billion UAH to reach the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold for a 'Yes' outcome. The evidence strongly suggests this threshold was crossed.\n\nSeveral factors contributed to a significant increase in March:\n1.  **New Borrowing:** Ukraine received a confirmed $400 million (~16 billion UAH) IMF loan tranche and raised approximately 26 billion UAH from domestic bond auctions.\n2.  **Currency Devaluation:** The Hryvnia depreciated by 0.7% against the USD in March, which is estimated to have added 9-11 billion UAH to the total debt stock due to the revaluation of foreign-denominated debt.\n\nThese factors alone sum to an increase of approximately 51-53 billion UAH, substantially exceeding the 31 billion UAH required. This calculation does not even include the expected €1 billion EU loan tranche, which, if disbursed in late March, would push the total even higher. While there were debt servicing costs, the report notes they were 'modest' and thus highly unlikely to offset these large inflows.\n\nHistorically, an increase of this magnitude is not unusual; in seven of the twelve months prior to March 2025, the monthly debt increase was over 30 billion UAH.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 95% to account for small tail risks, such as a major, unannounced principal repayment or unexpected lags or revisions in data reporting from the source. My probability is not lower because the confirmed capital inflows and currency effects are, on their own, more than sufficient to cross the threshold. I would only lower my forecast if information emerged that all major loan disbursements were delayed and a significant debt repayment occurred in March.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
