    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Nord Stream 2 AG remains on the OFAC SDN List on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration debates broader Russia energy sanctions relief but opts for narrower steps (e.g., general licenses or easing enforcement elsewhere) and leaves Nord Stream 2 AG on the SDN List. Bureaucratic inertia, political blowback risk, and the pipeline’s damaged/idle status make delisting low priority, so no action occurs before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The White House decides to signal a policy shift on Russia energy and instructs State/Treasury to remove Nord Stream 2 AG from the SDN List (potentially alongside a PEESA waiver and a broader sanctions recalibration). OFAC posts a delisting notice and the entity no longer appears on the SDN List before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo bias and timing: There are only ~8 weeks left. OFAC delistings can happen quickly, but typically follow a clear policy decision and coordinated messaging. In the absence of a firm decision soon, the default is that the entity remains listed on July 1.\n- Limited policy payoff to delisting NS2 AG: The pipeline is damaged/idle and not delivering gas to Europe. Removing Nord Stream 2 AG from the SDN List yields little market impact compared with other options (easing enforcement of energy price caps, targeted licenses, shipping/insurance flex). That reduces the incentive to spend political capital on this specific delisting.\n- Political cost: Delisting Nord Stream 2 AG is symbolically fraught given Russia’s war and the pipeline’s history. It would provoke domestic and allied criticism for negligible practical benefit, making it an unattractive early move even if the administration is considering broader sanctions relief.\n- Evidence for some chance: The cited Politico report (2025-04-23) says the White House is debating lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, explicitly mentioning Nord Stream. That lifts the probability above a very low baseline because it indicates the option is on the table.\n- Research assistant’s input: No additional information available, so I place extra weight on the status quo and general patterns of sanctions policy and timing.\nWhy not higher: Short runway to July 1, high symbolic cost, low benefit compared with alternatives, and bureaucratic friction all argue against a near-term delisting.\nWhy not lower: Active internal debate creates a non-trivial chance; if the administration wants an early signal in a broader Russia/Ukraine policy shift, a targeted delisting could be bundled with other measures.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting of an imminent PEESA waiver or delisting decision; Treasury/State signaling forthcoming Russia energy sanctions changes that specifically mention Nord Stream 2 AG; draft Federal Register/OFAC notice leaks; signs of a larger diplomatic package (e.g., Ukraine ceasefire framework) tied to sanctions relief.\nWhat would move me down: Clear statements from the White House/Congress opposing any NS2-related relief; reports that the internal debate has cooled or is focusing exclusively on other energy measures; allied (Germany/EU) pushback making NS2 delisting politically toxic; simple passage of time without preparatory signals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
