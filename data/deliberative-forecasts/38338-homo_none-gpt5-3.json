    "review": "Both forecasters appropriately emphasize the short window, lack of a forcing deadline for a 2026 race, and Morgan’s history of public deliberation without quick commitment. They add a useful base-rate framing: for a 2026 gubernatorial, a pre-July 2025 announcement is early. I also found their mention of quarter-end optics (June 30) as a countervailing reason for a June launch a helpful nuance. The absence of concrete pre-launch signals (staff hires, venue holds, filings, media advisories) is a strong argument to weight the status quo. Overall, their reasoning is convincing and pushes me modestly downward from my initial view; I only stay slightly higher than them because Morgan’s wealth and penchant for seizing media moments make a surprise video launch plausible, and the Politico reporting suggested a concrete blueprint rather than idle chatter.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~24 days. Default outcome is No absent new signals.\n- Status quo: No announcement yet; no imminent indicators have surfaced.\n- No scenario: Morgan continues exploring, waits for later-2025 timing when attention is higher and strategy is clearer; no filing or event leaks occur in June.\n- Yes scenario: Morgan drops a late-June video to leverage quarter-end optics or to freeze the field; his self-funding and independence allow a rapid, low-friction launch without typical pre-announcement breadcrumbs.\n- Evidence and balance: The May 15 Politico piece indicates genuine planning, but there’s no external deadline and June is early for a 2026 gubernatorial. Morgan’s track record of flirtations without swift declarations further tilts toward No in a short window. The June 30 quarter-end and his ability to move fast keep a nontrivial upside. Net effect: I lower my estimate modestly to align more with base rates and the lack of imminence signals while retaining a bit of weight on a surprise launch possibility.",
