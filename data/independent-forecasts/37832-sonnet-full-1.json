  "information": "In January 2025, Databricks completed a major funding round, raising over $15.25 billion. This included a $10 billion Series J equity financing round, which valued the company at $62 billion, and an additional $5.25 billion in debt financing provided by several major banks. New investors in the equity round included Meta as a strategic partner. The funding is intended to accelerate the development of new AI products, expand market reach, and finance acquisitions. A portion of the funds was also designated to offer liquidity to current and former employees.\n\nDatabricks has an upcoming Data + AI Summit scheduled for June 9-12, 2025. Keynote speakers announced for the event include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Anthropic, and Microsoft. Previously, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi had described 2024 as a \"dumb\" year for IPOs and has made statements suggesting flexibility on the timing of a public offering, mentioning both 2025 and 2026 as possibilities. A January 2025 report noted that a public offering within a year \"wouldn't be a huge surprise.\"\n\nAs of late May 2025, there have been no public reports of Databricks selecting underwriters for an IPO or of the company making a confidential S-1 filing with the SEC. Market sentiment has been described as uncertain, with some IPO advisors noting that while planning is occurring, macroeconomic concerns might cause delays. Other major tech startups, such as Stripe, have also remained private despite IPO expectations. In contrast, companies like Klarna and eToro have reportedly filed confidential IPO paperwork.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Databricks has not announced IPO plans and continues to operate as a private company following its recent massive funding round",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks continues operating privately through June 2025, citing market uncertainty and its strong capital position from the January funding round. The company makes no IPO-related announcements at its Data + AI Summit or elsewhere, consistent with CEO statements about flexibility on timing between 2025 and 2026",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Databricks uses its June 9-12 Data + AI Summit as a platform to announce IPO intentions, capitalizing on high-profile attendees and media attention. Alternatively, the company files an S-1 with the SEC or makes an announcement on its website before July 1st, possibly responding to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No for several compelling reasons. First, Databricks just completed a massive $15.25 billion funding round in January 2025, including $10 billion in equity at a $62 billion valuation. This substantially reduces any immediate capital pressure to go public. Second, as of late May 2025, there are no reported signals of imminent IPO preparation - no underwriter selection has been announced and no confidential S-1 filing has been reported. Third, the timeframe is extremely tight with only 40 days remaining. IPO preparations typically require significant lead time, even for just announcing intent. Fourth, the CEO previously called 2024 a 'dumb' year for IPOs and has indicated flexibility about timing between 2025 and 2026, suggesting no urgent deadline. Fifth, market conditions are described as uncertain with macroeconomic concerns that might cause delays. However, the probability is not negligible because: the upcoming Data + AI Summit (June 9-12) provides a natural high-profile venue for an IPO announcement with major CEO keynote speakers present; a January report stated an IPO within a year 'wouldn't be a huge surprise'; and the question only asks about announcing plans (not actually going public), which is a lower bar. The company is mature and valuable enough ($62 billion valuation) that an announcement would be credible. For my forecast to increase, I'd need to see reports of underwriter selection, rumors of confidential filings, or explicit leadership signals about near-term plans. For it to decrease, I'd need explicit statements about waiting until 2026 or further funding announcements. The base rate for surprise IPO announcements is low, especially post-mega-funding-round, but the June summit creates a small window of elevated possibility",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn January 2025, Databricks completed a major funding round, raising over $15.25 billion.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
