  "information": "According to multiple South Korean industry and government sources from January 2025, South Korea and Vietnam were in the final stages of negotiating a deal for South Korea to export K9 self-propelled howitzers. The proposed agreement was reported to involve the sale of approximately 20 K9 units for a value of around $300 million. The deal was expected to be finalized in the first quarter of 2025 and would mark South Korea's first arms export to Vietnam. If completed, Vietnam would become the 10th foreign country to acquire the K9 system.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months remain until the July 1, 2025 resolution date",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - currently no agreement has been announced",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The negotiations experience further delays beyond July 1st due to technical issues, budget constraints, or geopolitical pressure from China on Vietnam. Alternatively, Vietnam decides to purchase from a different supplier or the deal stalls indefinitely without formal announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The negotiations that were in 'final stages' in January 2025 conclude successfully in May or June 2025, with either Vietnam or South Korea formally announcing the agreement for export of K9 self-propelled howitzers before the July 1st deadline.",
    "rationale": "My research assistant reports that as of January 2025, Vietnam and South Korea were in 'final stages' of negotiating a deal for approximately 20 K9 howitzers worth $300 million, expected to be finalized in Q1 2025. However, we are now in May 2025 (Q2), and no announcement has been made yet. This is a significant negative signal - the deal has missed its expected timeline. The passage of the Q1 deadline without announcement suggests either: (1) unexpected complications arose, (2) the initial timeline was too optimistic, or (3) the deal may not happen at all. Defense procurement deals frequently face delays due to technical specifications, financing arrangements, political considerations, or external pressure. Vietnam may face Chinese pressure against defense cooperation with South Korea. Status quo bias strongly favors No since no announcement exists yet. However, two months remain - a reasonable timeframe for finalizing advanced negotiations. The deal's reported specificity (20 units, $300M value) and characterization as 'final stages' by multiple sources suggests substantive progress had been made. South Korea's successful K9 exports to 9 countries demonstrates the product's viability. Both nations have strategic interest in the deal. My forecast is not higher because Q1 passed without announcement, suggesting real obstacles exist. It's not lower because 2 months is sufficient time, the negotiations were reportedly advanced, and both sides have incentives to complete the deal. I would update higher with news of resumed high-level negotiations or positive statements from officials. I would update lower if June passes without announcement or if reports emerge of deal collapse.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Vietnam and South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Korea Herald: [South Korea-Vietnam ties enter new strategic terrain, but need more detailed road map: Seoul envoy](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464718) \"Vietnam is reportedly in negotiations to import 20 units of K9 self-propelled howitzers from Korea in a deal valued at $300 million. If finalized, it would mark Korea’s first defense arms sale to the country.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the governments of Vietnam and/or South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export 2 or more self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam. If no such agreement is announced after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple South Korean industry and government sources from January 2025, South Korea and Vietnam were in the final stages of negotiating a deal for South Korea to export K9 self-propelled howitzers.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
