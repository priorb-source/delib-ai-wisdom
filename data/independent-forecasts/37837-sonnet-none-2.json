    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. June 2025 begins in about one week, and the resolution will be determined on or after July 1, 2025, when NUFORC's website is checked for the June 2025 reporting data.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the threshold of 400 reports is likely not exceeded. Based on NUFORC's 180,000+ reports over approximately 51 years of operation, the historical average is roughly 294 reports per month. This suggests that 400 reports would represent an approximately 36% increase above the long-term monthly average, indicating an above-average but not impossible month.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 sees typical reporting patterns with 250-400 reports. Normal summer weather patterns occur, there are no major UAP-related news events or viral sighting videos, and public reporting behavior remains consistent with recent baseline levels. The month experiences routine variation around the historical average.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 exceeds 400 reports due to a combination of factors: favorable summer weather leading to more outdoor activities and observations, continued elevated public interest in UAPs following recent Congressional hearings and government disclosures, a viral sighting event that prompts retrospective reporting, or natural month-to-month variation pushing the count above the threshold.",
    "rationale": "Unfortunately, my research assistant provided no additional data on recent monthly trends from NUFORC, which creates significant uncertainty. I'm relying primarily on the historical baseline of approximately 294 reports per month derived from the 180,000+ total reports over 51 years. The 400-report threshold represents a meaningful elevation above this average. Key factors supporting a higher probability include: (1) June falls in summer when weather conditions favor outdoor activities and observations; (2) recent years have seen increased government and media attention to UAPs, potentially sustaining elevated reporting rates; (3) natural month-to-month volatility means occasional spikes above historical averages are expected. Factors limiting the probability: (1) status quo bias strongly suggests outcomes near historical norms rather than significant deviations; (2) 400+ would require approximately top-tertile performance relative to historical average; (3) no evidence of specific triggering events scheduled for June 2025. To update higher, I would need evidence of: recent monthly averages consistently exceeding 350-400 reports, a major scheduled UAP-related event in June 2025, or indications of accelerating public interest. To update lower, I would need evidence that recent monthly reports are consistently below 300 or that reporting has declined from historical levels.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of UFO sightings reported by the National UFO Reporting Center exceed 400 for June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts greater than 400 UFO/UAP sighting reports at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) for the month of June 2025, as displayed when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
