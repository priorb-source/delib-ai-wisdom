    "review": "The other two forecasters reached a consensus of 8%, slightly higher than my initial 6%. Their reasoning is sound and aligns broadly with my own, emphasizing the low base rate of change but acknowledging non-zero risks from specific companies (e.g., Boeing, 3M) or unexpected corporate actions. The most compelling new argument came from Forecaster 3's explicit base rate calculation, which derived a ~7% probability for a two-month window based on the frequency of changes over the past 12 years (5 events in 12 years). This quantitative approach provides a more robust anchor than my initial qualitative assessment. I also found the clarification on the timing of the last index change (February 2024) helpful. My initial read of the prompt led me to believe the change was more recent, which would have suppressed the near-term probability. Knowing the last change was over a year ago removes this dampening effect.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 6% to 8%. My initial reasoning, which focused on the powerful inertia of the index and the short timeline, was directionally correct but appears to have been slightly too conservative. The primary driver for my update is the formal base rate analysis provided by Forecaster 3. A calculation based on ~0.4 change events per year yields a probability of approximately 7-8% for the 67-day resolution window. This data-driven baseline is more persuasive than my initial, more intuitive estimate. While I still believe the status quo is the overwhelmingly likely outcome, this more rigorous approach suggests I was underweighting the historical frequency of change. The consensus of two other experts at 8% further strengthens my conviction to adjust. The fundamental model has not changed—a change is a low-probability event that would likely be triggered by a major corporate action or a crisis at a specific component—but my quantification of that probability is now better anchored to historical data.",
