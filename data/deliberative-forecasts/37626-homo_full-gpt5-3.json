    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my initial take: the series is very stable, bananas are a loss-leader with sticky retail pricing, and the threshold is tight. The most useful addition is their explicit skepticism about the purported 10% tariff effective Apr 5, 2025. That claim is unconfirmed and inconsistent with the typical tariff treatment of bananas (often zero under trade agreements). Discounting that reduces upside risk. They also correctly note that U.S.–China trade news is weakly relevant, that Latin America is the main supply source, and that shipping disruptions affecting the Red Sea are not central for U.S. bananas. Their emphasis on the April BLS print as the key near-term signal is well placed.",
    "rationale": "I slightly increase my probability for under $0.6300. Starting from Mar 2025 at $0.625, a move to ≥$0.630 requires a ≥0.5 cent increase over two months—plausible but not the base case given sticky pricing and bananas’ role as a price image item. Dole’s noted cost pressures create some upside risk, but improved volumes and typical retailer behavior temper pass-through by May. The unverified “10% banana tariff” appears unlikely to be in force; removing that as a base-case driver lowers the probability of a quick jump above the threshold. Net: status quo plus modest drift still points to something like $0.627–$0.629 in May, with tail risk to ≥$0.630 if cost pass-through accelerates. I move up modestly from 58% to 62% on discounting the tariff risk while acknowledging the threshold’s tightness.",
