    "review": "Both forecasters raise critical points I underweighted in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes the extreme narrowness of the margin - only 0.5 cents separates the March price from the threshold. They also note that the price trajectory from January ($0.621) to March ($0.625) already showed upward momentum of 0.4 cents even before the tariff. Forecaster 3 provides valuable nuance on the timing, noting that the April 5 tariff date means May data represents 1-2 full months of potential pass-through, which is more significant than I initially weighted. They also correctly note that the resolution is 'under $0.6300' (not 'at or under'), making the threshold even tighter.\n\nThe most compelling argument from both is the knife-edge nature of this question. A mere 0.8% increase from the March price would push us over the threshold. While I correctly identified loss-leader behavior and price stickiness as strong factors, I didn't adequately weight how little of a price increase is needed for a No outcome when combined with the concrete 10% tariff shock plus Dole's reported higher fruit and shipping costs.\n\nForecaster 2's 40% may be too pessimistic given bananas' exceptional price stability, but Forecaster 3's 54% appropriately reflects this as nearly a coin flip with slight edge to status quo.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I'm updating downward from my initial 68% forecast. The critical factors I underweighted are: (1) The extremely narrow 0.5-cent margin from March's $0.625 to the $0.630 threshold; (2) The existing upward price trajectory from January to March; (3) The longer pass-through window - the tariff has been in effect through all of April and into May, giving more time for retail price adjustments than I initially considered; (4) The compound effect of multiple cost pressures (10% tariff PLUS Dole's reported higher fruit and shipping costs).\n\nHowever, I maintain the Yes outcome remains more likely than not because: (1) Bananas demonstrate exceptional price stickiness - showing only 23.5% inflation over 20 years versus 94-136% for other foods; (2) Loss-leader behavior is particularly strong for bananas as a high-visibility item; (3) One to two months may still be insufficient for full retail pass-through, especially if retailers are strategically absorbing costs; (4) Improved banana volumes could provide offsetting downward pressure.\n\nThe key insight from this deliberation is that this question hinges on whether retailers pass through even a partial 1-2 cents of the tariff cost in the short term, making it much closer to a coin flip than my initial assessment suggested.",
