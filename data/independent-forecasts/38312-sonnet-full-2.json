  "information": "As of early June 2025, India has not received an official invitation to the G7 summit scheduled to take place in Canada from June 15-17. Multiple media outlets, including The Tribune and the Hindustan Times, have reported this, citing official sources. These reports indicate that no advance preparations for a high-level visit from India are underway. This is contrary to the protocol for such trips, which are typically planned weeks in advance for security and logistical coordination. Canada has extended invitations to other non-G7 countries, including Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil.\n\nDiplomatic relations between India and Canada were impacted following the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada in June 2023. The previous Canadian government under Justin Trudeau had made allegations regarding Indian government involvement, which India denied. Following a change in government, new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi exchanged messages expressing a desire to strengthen bilateral ties. However, Indian officials have stated concerns regarding the activities of Khalistani elements in Canada and expect Ottawa to guarantee the safety of Indian diplomats.\n\nSikh organizations in Canada, including the 'Sikh Federation' and the 'World Sikh Organization', have publicly demanded that the Canadian government not invite Prime Minister Modi to the G7 summit. They have cited the Indian government's alleged involvement in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and other human rights concerns. In a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney, the World Sikh Organization of Canada stated that inviting the Indian Prime Minister would be an 'irresponsible decision' and would signal that Canada is willing to ignore foreign interference.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12-14 days. The G7 Summit is scheduled for June 15-17, 2025, and today is June 3, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Modi does not attend. India has not received an official invitation, no advance preparations are underway, and the summit is only ~12 days away.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "India never receives an invitation from Canada, or receives one too late for Modi to organize the trip. Alternatively, India receives an invitation but Modi declines due to strained India-Canada diplomatic relations, concerns about Khalistani elements, domestic scheduling conflicts, or security considerations for Indian diplomats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Canada's new government under Mark Carney extends a last-minute invitation to Modi in the next few days. Despite the compressed timeline, diplomatic channels work rapidly to address security and protocol concerns. Modi decides the strategic benefits of attending outweigh the logistical challenges and bilateral tensions, and his team quickly organizes the trip on an expedited basis.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors non-attendance. Multiple critical factors point toward No: (1) India has not received an invitation as of early June 2025, despite Canada inviting other non-G7 nations like Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil; (2) High-level international visits typically require weeks of advance planning for security and logistics, but only 12 days remain; (3) No advance preparations are underway according to official sources; (4) Significant diplomatic tensions exist between India and Canada following the Nijjar case; (5) Influential Sikh organizations are actively lobbying against Modi's invitation. While the new Canadian PM Mark Carney and Modi have exchanged positive messages about strengthening ties, this hasn't translated into concrete action like an invitation. The compressed timeline is particularly constraining - organizing a Prime Minister's international visit in under two weeks would be highly unusual and logistically challenging. For my forecast to move higher, we would need an immediate invitation plus rapid diplomatic resolution and Modi's willingness to accept on extremely short notice. For it to move lower, we'd need explicit confirmation no invitation will be sent. Given the strong status quo bias and multiple obstacles, but acknowledging a small possibility of last-minute diplomatic breakthroughs, I assess the probability at 10%.",
