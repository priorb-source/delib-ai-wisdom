    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same central tradeoff I highlighted: mean reversion from an extreme low versus persistence of inflation/gas-price headwinds and a strict “>50.8” threshold (ties are No). They also correctly stress that April’s level is near the historical floor, so downside room is limited relative to the small uptick needed for Yes. Forecaster 2 weights negative momentum slightly more (60%), while Forecaster 3 aligns closely with my prior (63%). Neither introduced materially new evidence beyond what I considered; the drivers they cite (gas prices, equity tone, inflation expectations, claims) are the right near-term indicators. I find their reasoning sound and largely consistent with my own. The one nuance I continue to note is the preliminary timing typically landing before the mid-month CPI, making lived prices/market tone especially salient—both did implicitly cover this via gas prices and risk sentiment. Overall, their inputs modestly reinforce a slight-Yes lean rather than shifting it.",
    "rationale": "April’s 50.8 is extraordinarily low and near past troughs, making a modest bounce statistically more likely than another leg down absent a fresh shock. Month-to-month noise alone can clear the narrow bar (>50.8). Offsetting that, persistent inflation narrative, seasonally firm gasoline prices, and tighter financial conditions could keep sentiment subdued, and a flat print/tie would resolve No. Labor market data remain decent (claims not deteriorating meaningfully), which reduces the odds of a further collapse. With no new concrete developments since my prior view, the balance still favors a small rebound, but the edge should stay modest. I make a slight calibration toward the middle of the group after deliberation, reflecting uncertainty and the strict threshold.",
