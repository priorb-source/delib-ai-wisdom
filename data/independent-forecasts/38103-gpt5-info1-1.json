  "information": "As of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro officially excluded Tesla products, including electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters, from its CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs. The stated reason for the policy change is to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S.-produced goods where practicable, as part of a broader trade dispute. The EV charger rebate for single-family homes covers up to 50% of the cost, to a maximum of $350. The policy was publicly defended by B.C. Premier David Eby and Energy Minister Adrian Dix. Products purchased or pre-approved before March 12, 2025, remain eligible for the rebate.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the BC Hydro page continues to state Tesla products are not eligible for the EV home charger rebate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BC Hydro keeps the underlying exclusion but revises the webpage to generic language (e.g., excluding U.S.-made products) without naming Tesla, or overhauls/pauses the program page so it no longer explicitly mentions Tesla ineligibility.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Policy remains unchanged and the webpage continues to explicitly say Tesla products are not eligible for the single-family home EV charger rebate.",
    "rationale": "The exclusion was newly implemented on March 12, 2025, with clear political backing from Premier Eby and Energy Minister Dix and framed as part of a broader policy to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S.-made goods where practicable. The short time horizon to July 1 makes policy reversal or a negotiated trade resolution unlikely. Communications-wise, Tesla is the most salient brand, so maintaining an explicit call-out helps avoid consumer confusion; thus the page is likely to keep naming Tesla. However, the resolution hinges on explicit mention on the specified page. A nontrivial risk is that BC Hydro updates the page to generic origin-based language without naming Tesla, or restructures/pauses the page, which would resolve as No even if the underlying exclusion persists. Summary of RA info influencing forecast: as of March 12, 2025 Tesla chargers, storage, and inverters are ineligible for CleanBC/BC Hydro rebates; the EV home charger rebate is up to 50% (max $350); the policy has been publicly defended by BC leadership; pre-March 12 purchases/pre-approvals remain eligible. Why not higher: webpage-language risk and potential page redesigns could remove the explicit Tesla mention. Why not lower: strong status quo inertia, political ownership of the policy, and very limited time for legal, trade, or administrative changes. What would move me upward: explicit BC Hydro/BC government reaffirmation that Tesla remains ineligible and keeping brand-specific language on the exact page. What would move me downward: an update shifting wording to generic origin-based exclusions, site restructuring that omits the Tesla reference, hints of policy softening, or legal challenges prompting wording changes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill BC Hydro still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates. If you purchased or have received pre-approval for your Tesla product before March 12, 2025, it can still qualify for rebates and will be processed as normal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if BC Hydro at [this page](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebates-home-chargers.html) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, says that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program. If it does not mention Tesla being ineligible, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro officially excluded Tesla products, including electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters, from its CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs. The stated reason for the policy change is to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S.-produced goods where practicable, as part of a broader trade dispute. The EV charger rebate for single-family homes covers up to 50% of the cost, to a maximum of $350. The policy was publicly defended by B.C. Premier David Eby and Energy Minister Adrian Dix. Products purchased or pre-approved before March 12, 2025, remain eligible for the rebate.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
