    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the extraordinary severity of the allegation (shooting an unarmed teen) and the fact that recall standards hinge on political fitness, not criminal conviction—points that plausibly push the outcome toward removal beyond the ~60% recall-success base rate. They also cite Colorado’s recent small-town recall successes and the salience of the incident in a tiny electorate. These are consistent with my prior view but framed more forcefully. They may underweight small-electorate volatility and personal ties that could buoy Metz despite the optics, but overall their case for a lower survival probability is coherent. I didn’t see new factual data (e.g., polling, endorsements, ballot return splits), but their argument about how voters likely interpret the incident—given the sheriff’s statement—is persuasive as a qualitative adjustment.",
    "rationale": "Baseline survival from recalls that reach the ballot is roughly 40%. Adjusting downward: the alleged conduct is unusually severe, involves a minor, and the sheriff’s statement undermines self-defense narratives; media attention is negative; the recall petition’s success in a <400 active-voter town signals organized opposition; Colorado has recently seen successful small-town recalls. Adjusting upward: tiny electorates can be volatile; personal relationships and status quo bias can matter; mail-only dynamics could favor whichever side is better organized (not clearly observable here). Netting these, I previously set 30%. Given the strength of the qualitative downside (severity + salience + credible law-enforcement narrative) and the lack of countervailing indicators (no public endorsements or polling suggesting Metz resilience), I nudge down to 25% to reflect higher-than-average removal odds while preserving meaningful small-N uncertainty.",
