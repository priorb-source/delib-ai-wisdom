    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tourism continues its growth trajectory as seen in February 2025 data (which showed 2.2% increase over February 2024). European tourists, who form the bulk of Canary Islands visitors, maintain or increase their travel. The Easter holiday falling predominantly in April 2025 (April 20) versus late March 2024 (March 31) brings additional holiday travelers to April 2025 numbers. Concerns about US tariff policies have minimal impact since American tourists represent a small fraction of total arrivals.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant economic shock in major European source markets (UK, Germany, Spain) reduces travel demand. Unexpected disruptions occur such as airline strikes, severe weather events, or a health crisis. The Trump tariff concerns materialize more broadly than expected, creating general economic uncertainty that dampens European travel. Internal economic problems in key feeder markets lead to reduced discretionary spending on tourism.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors no decline. The most recent comparable data (February 2025) showed a 2.2% increase over February 2024, indicating healthy tourism growth. The Canary Islands' tourism is predominantly European-based, with UK, Germany, and mainland Spain as primary sources, so US tariff concerns mentioned in the background would have limited direct impact. Critically, Easter timing significantly favors April 2025: Easter fell on March 31 in 2024 but April 20 in 2025, meaning the Easter holiday period and school breaks largely fell in April 2025 versus March 2024. This calendar effect alone should boost April 2025 numbers. Since we're at April 30, the month has essentially concluded, and any major disruptions would already be known. My research assistant provided no information suggesting unusual disruptions occurred in April 2025. For my forecast to be higher (more likely to see decline), I would need evidence of: actual disruptions in April 2025, March 2025 data showing a reversal of the growth trend, or significant economic shocks in European markets. For it to be lower (even less likely to decline), I would want confirmation of strong April booking data or advance tourism indicators. Given the strong status quo bias, recent growth trends, and favorable Easter calendar positioning, I assign a low probability to decline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
