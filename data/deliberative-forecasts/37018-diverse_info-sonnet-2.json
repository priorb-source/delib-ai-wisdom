    "review": "The other forecasters provide valuable category-specific details I lacked initially. Forecaster 2's methodical approach of estimating probabilities for each category (Entertainer 5-7%, Female Artist 10-20%, Music Event 5-10%) and combining them is analytically rigorous. The key new information is that this is Ballerini's first Entertainer of the Year nomination, which historically faces long odds, and that Lainey Wilson appears dominant in Female Artist. Forecaster 3's 30% seems slightly optimistic given the specific competitive headwinds described. Both forecasters correctly identify that three independent shots at winning materially lifts overall probability above the per-nomination base rate, but the competitive landscape (Wilson's momentum, first-time Entertainer nominee challenges, likely stronger Music Event contenders) keeps this bounded.",
    "rationale": "My original 20% forecast was slightly conservative but directionally correct. The other forecasters' category-by-category breakdown validates the intuition that multiple nominations increase chances while highlighting why each individual category remains an uphill battle. If I estimate her odds at approximately 6% for Entertainer (first-time nominee against touring powerhouses), 12% for Female Artist (credible but Lainey Wilson favored), and 8% for Music Event (volatile category but likely facing stronger competitors), the combined probability of at least one win is roughly 1 - (0.94 × 0.88 × 0.92) ≈ 24%. This calculation assumes near-independence across categories, which is reasonable though imperfect. Forecaster 2's 24% represents solid probabilistic reasoning. Forecaster 3's 30% weights the 'three chances' factor more heavily than the competitive dynamics warrant. I'm updating from 20% to 23% - splitting the difference but leaning toward Forecaster 2's analysis, which better accounts for the specific competitive obstacles while properly crediting the multi-category advantage.",
