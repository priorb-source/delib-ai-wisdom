    "status_quo_outcome": "The 'Tush-Push' remains a legal play in the NFL.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The NFL owners and Competition Committee do not hold or do not pass a rule change banning the play before the June 1, 2025 deadline. Discussions may continue, but no official action is taken in time, leaving the play legal for the 2025 season.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Amid ongoing debate, the NFL convenes a vote among team owners before June 1, 2025. A supermajority of at least 24 owners votes to outlaw or significantly restrict the 'Tush-Push,' and the league formally announces the rule change.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the high barrier for rule changes and the very short timeframe remaining. The status quo is that the play is legal, and altering the NFL rulebook requires a supermajority of 24 out of 32 owners, a significant hurdle for any controversial issue. The main window for rule changes, the annual league meeting in March, has already passed for 2025. While the provided articles from mid-2024 indicate the topic was tabled for future discussion, introducing a major change this late in the offseason, as teams are deep into their preparations, is procedurally difficult and disruptive. The path of least resistance is to maintain the current rules for the upcoming season and revisit the issue in the next cycle. The probability is not lower than 15% because the 'Tush-Push' remains a highly debated topic due to player safety concerns and its competitive impact, as highlighted by the reports of strong support for a ban. The NFL Competition Committee has voiced concerns, and it's plausible, though unlikely, that these concerns could escalate into a late, specially-convened vote. The probability is not higher because overcoming the institutional inertia, convincing teams that benefit from the play, and marshalling a 75% consensus vote in the less than three weeks remaining is highly improbable. I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of a vote being scheduled before the deadline. I would decrease it as the deadline approaches with no news of such a vote.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the NFL ban the \"Tush-Push\" before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nESPN: [Vote on tush push ban tabled by NFL owners for more discussion](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44490292/sources-tush-push-ban-vote-tabled-nfl-owners) | CBS Sports: [Expansive 'Tush Push' ban could have strong support at NFL's next owners meeting, per report](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/expansive-tush-push-ban-could-have-strong-support-at-nfls-next-owners-meeting-per-report/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Football League officially approves or announces a rule restricting the quarterback sneak known as the [Tush-Push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sneak#Tush_push) before June 1, 2025. If there are no reports of this occurring before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
