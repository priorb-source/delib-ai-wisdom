  "information": "Changes to national SNAP eligibility rules require either a congressional amendment to the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 or a formal USDA rulemaking process. The Act broadly authorizes SNAP benefits for 'any food or food product intended for human consumption.' In the past, the USDA has rejected state waiver requests to restrict specific food items due to concerns about implementation challenges, costs, and the potential impact on recipients. According to the USDA, approximately 20% of all SNAP spending goes towards sugary drinks and snacks.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 42 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "USDA/FNS edits the page language before July 1 to remove the exact phrase “snack foods,” perhaps replacing it with a synonym like “snacks” or by restructuring the list so that “snack foods” is no longer explicitly mentioned, even though eligibility has not yet changed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The page remains as-is, continuing to list “snack foods” explicitly among eligible items on July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: The page explicitly includes “snack foods” as of May 5, 2025. Government content like this is typically stable absent a formal policy change. With only ~6 weeks left, the status quo strongly favors “Yes.”\n- Policy/change mechanics: Per the research assistant, restricting SNAP-eligible items requires either congressional amendment to the Food and Nutrition Act or a formal USDA rulemaking. The Act currently allows “any food or food product intended for human consumption.” Historically, USDA has rejected state attempts to restrict categories due to implementation/cost/recipient impact. Even if the new administration wants restrictions (as suggested in the cited article), formal rulemaking with proposal, comment, and finalization is unlikely to conclude—and be reflected in consumer-facing guidance—by July 1.\n- Distinction that matters here: The question hinges on the exact phrase “snack foods” remaining on the cited page, not whether snacks are actually allowed. The main risk is an editorial tweak (e.g., changing the wording to “snacks” or consolidating categories) unrelated to immediate policy change. That could happen faster than rulemaking, but it’s still an atypical mid-cycle change without a policy driver.\n- Why not higher: There is nontrivial risk of a quick content refresh for political optics, or a routine editorial update that inadvertently changes the phrase. A site refresh or page restructure could also drop the specific wording.\n- Why not lower: Substantive eligibility changes by July 1 are very unlikely due to required process and timelines. The page language has been stable for years, and agencies usually avoid preemptive consumer-facing edits that could mislead.\n- What would move me upward: No signs of ongoing SNAP page edits by mid-June; USDA/FNS statements reinforcing status quo; lack of any proposed rule or policy memo targeting snacks before July 1.\n- What would move me downward: Evidence of an imminent SNAP site rewrite; a USDA press release or memo previewing terminology changes; a proposed or interim final rule specifically targeting snacks/sugary drinks with instructions to update public guidance; visible changes to other related FNS pages’ phrasing.\nOverall, slow policy processes and the short window favor the exact phrase remaining in place on July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nChanges to national SNAP eligibility rules require either a congressional amendment to the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 or a formal USDA rulemaking process.

According to the USDA, approximately 20% of all SNAP spending goes towards sugary drinks and snacks.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
