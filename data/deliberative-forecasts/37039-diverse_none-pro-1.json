    "review": "The other forecasters provided two crucial insights that I had undervalued. Forecaster 3's clarification of the resolution criteria—that it hinges on what the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) website *displays*, irrespective of enforcement or legal injunctions—is a game-changing point. This significantly weakens the 'No' scenario pathway that relies on legal challenges delaying implementation. My initial analysis incorrectly conflated enforcement with the official listing. Forecaster 3 also made a compelling case that bureaucratic inertia, once an HTS entry is posted, makes a reversal or change within such a short timeframe highly unlikely. Forecaster 2 correctly identified the ambiguity of the an HTS entry is posted, makes a reversal or change within such a short timeframe highly unlikely. Forecaster 2 correctly identified the ambiguity of the current status (is the tariff proposed or already being codified?) and introduced the concept of 'technical risk' due to the question's specificity (e.g., the rate could be 30% or the subheading could be slightly different). While I find Forecaster 3's counterargument—that the specificity is actually evidence that the question is based on a real, finalized document, thus favoring a 'Yes' outcome—to be more persuasive, the technical risk is a valid consideration that tempers an overly confident forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 65% to 73%. The primary driver for this increase is Forecaster 3's analysis of the resolution criteria. My initial forecast assumed that legal challenges could prevent the tariff from being listed by the deadline, but as Forecaster 3 rightly pointed out, a court injunction might halt the collection of duties but is unlikely to force the immediate removal of the listing from the USITC website. This eliminates a significant path to a 'No' resolution. Furthermore, I am now more convinced that the high specificity of the question (subheading 9903.01.60 and 31% rate) is more likely a signal that a formal proclamation is already drafted or issued, rather than a source of technical risk for the forecast. The main remaining uncertainty is the raw speed of the bureaucratic process: getting a Presidential Proclamation finalized and having the USITC update its public-facing database. While the timeline is short (roughly 5 weeks from today), it is feasible for a high-priority action. My new forecast of 73% reflects a stronger belief that the administration's intent will translate into an updated HTS listing by June 1, while still reserving a 27% probability for bureaucratic delays, a last-minute policy change, or a technical error in implementation (e.g., a different subheading is used).",
