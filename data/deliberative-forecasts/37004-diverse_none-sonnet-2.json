    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that caused me to reconsider my initial assessment. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the scale and persistence of the Conservative lead, which I had noted but perhaps underweighted. Most importantly, Forecaster 3 raises a critical historical precedent I had not fully internalized: the Conservatives won the popular vote in BOTH 2019 and 2021 even when they lost the election and failed to form government. This is crucial context - if they could win the popular vote when they were in a weaker overall position and Trudeau won government, and they're polling even stronger now, that's a powerful signal. Forecaster 3 also makes an excellent structural argument about the center-left vote split (Liberals, NDP, Bloc) making it especially difficult for any single party to surpass the Conservatives in popular vote. This structural factor creates an inherent advantage for the Conservatives that I underappreciated. Both forecasters also note that the current lead is not just stable but substantial - often described as double-digit leads in the low-to-mid 40s versus mid-20s for Liberals. This magnitude provides significant buffer against normal campaign volatility.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe I was too cautious in my initial 72% forecast. The combination of three factors warrants a significant upward revision: (1) Historical precedent - CPC won the popular vote in the last two elections even when losing, suggesting they have structural advantages in vote accumulation; (2) The center-left split among Liberals, NDP, and Bloc creates a structural ceiling for any one party to surpass the Conservatives in total votes; (3) The magnitude of the current polling lead (often 15-20 points) provides substantial cushion against campaign effects. However, I'm not moving all the way to 92% because approximately 5-6 months remains - enough time for meaningful shifts, though major comebacks from this position are historically rare. Polling can contain systematic errors, and campaigns do occasionally produce surprises. The question specifically asks about popular vote, which is indeed easier for Conservatives to achieve than forming government, making the 2019 and 2021 precedents highly relevant. My updated forecast of 82% represents substantial confidence while maintaining appropriate humility about the time remaining and the inherent uncertainty in political forecasting.",
