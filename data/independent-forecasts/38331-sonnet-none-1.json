    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26 days until July 1, 2025 when the Wikipedia page will be checked",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - all seven countries continue to be listed as currently blocking X on Wikipedia",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the seven countries (most likely Myanmar or Venezuela) unblocks X or Wikipedia updates its listing to remove one or more countries based on editorial review, new information, or changes in how blocks are categorized. An edit war or lack of consensus could also prevent clear listing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "All seven countries maintain their blocks of X through the end of June 2025, and Wikipedia continues to list all of them in the 'currently blocked' section without significant editorial changes or disputes.",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily favors the status quo for several reasons. First, the timeframe is extremely short (26 days), and government censorship policies rarely change quickly, especially in authoritarian regimes. China, North Korea, Iran, Turkmenistan, and Russia have well-established, long-term internet censorship systems that are unlikely to change on this timescale. China's Great Firewall and North Korea's extreme restrictions are particularly entrenched. Russia blocked Twitter/X in March 2022 amid the Ukraine conflict, and given ongoing geopolitical tensions, reversal is highly unlikely. Myanmar and Venezuela represent the greatest uncertainty, as they have had more variable internet restriction policies, but even for these countries, unblocking within 26 days would be surprising. The main risk factors for a NO outcome are: (1) Wikipedia editorial decisions that might reclassify or update listings independent of actual policy changes, (2) possible unblocking by Myanmar or Venezuela, and (3) potential edit wars or consensus issues. However, the question design accounts for edit wars through admin discretion. My forecast is not higher because of uncertainty around Myanmar and Venezuela's policies and potential Wikipedia editorial factors. My forecast is not lower because the overwhelming majority of these seven countries have deeply entrenched censorship systems, and 26 days provides minimal time for policy shifts. I would update higher with evidence of continued strict enforcement in all countries or lower with news of any country considering unblocking or Wikipedia editorial discussions about reclassification.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
