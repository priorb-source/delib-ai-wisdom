    "review": "The other two forecasters independently arrived at the exact same 15% probability as I did, and for virtually the same reasons. This strong consensus reinforces my confidence in the initial analysis. Both forecasters correctly identified the core of the argument: the ~8-point jump required for a 'Yes' outcome is historically very rare, and the recent downward trend and weak underlying data (high inflation expectations, slowing job growth) make such a surge highly improbable. Forecaster 2 made a sharp point that the weak ADP report could be a leading indicator that invalidates the more optimistic, but conflicting, Conference Board survey. Forecaster 3 articulated well that the inherent volatility of the UMich index is a key reason not to assign an even lower probability. Neither analysis presented new evidence or a line of reasoning that I had not considered, but they confirmed that my weighting of the available factors is in line with other expert assessments.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of my fellow forecasters, my forecast remains unchanged at 15%. The deliberation process has revealed a strong consensus, strengthening my conviction in the initial reasoning. All three of us are anchored by the same primary observation: the Index of Consumer Sentiment would need to increase by more than 7.8 points from its May level of 52.2 to resolve as 'Yes'. A single-month increase of this magnitude is a historically rare event, occurring less than 3% of the time in the 2010-2019 period. The current economic fundamentals provide little reason to expect such an outlier event. The downward momentum of the index since February is strong, and the key drivers of UMich sentiment—personal finances and inflation expectations—are pointed in the wrong direction. Consumers' one-year inflation expectations are at a four-decade high, and data points like the slowing ADP jobs report and rising student loan delinquencies signal growing financial strain. While the conflicting rise in the Conference Board's confidence index warrants consideration, we all agree it should be discounted. The UMich survey is more sensitive to the inflation and personal finance concerns currently pressuring households, and as Forecaster 2 noted, the weak ADP data may preemptively invalidate the Conference Board's labor market-driven optimism. Therefore, the weight of the evidence continues to point overwhelmingly toward a 'No' outcome. I am not lowering my forecast below 15% because, as Forecaster 3 highlighted, the index is notoriously volatile, and a significant positive external shock, however unlikely, cannot be entirely ruled out.",
