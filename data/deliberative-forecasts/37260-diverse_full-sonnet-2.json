    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling analyses that align closely with my initial reasoning but with slightly lower probability assignments. Forecaster 3's analysis is particularly detailed, specifically citing Basic Law Article 21 and making the crucial distinction that without a formal application filed, a ban is literally impossible - not just unlikely. Both emphasize that even if an application were filed immediately, achieving a Constitutional Court ruling by July 1 would require breaking entirely with historical precedent, where such cases take years. The NPD case specifically took years and still failed. Their point about the timeline being 'not credible' (Forecaster 2) and 'implausible' even with immediate filing (Forecaster 3) is stronger than my 'impossibly rushed' characterization. All three of us identified the same core barriers: no application filed, insufficient time, lack of political majority, low base rate, and high legal threshold. The key question is whether my 2% versus their 1% is justified.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should update downward to 1%. The other forecasters make a compelling case that my 2% was slightly too optimistic. The critical insight is that without an application filed (current status as of May 2), a ban is literally impossible, not just highly unlikely. Even if an application were filed in the next few days, the Constitutional Court would need to complete in ~55 days what historically takes years - the NPD case took years and still resulted in no ban. For my 2% to be justified, I would need to believe there's a 1-in-50 chance of: (1) immediate application filing, (2) unprecedented expedited court process, (3) completed review in under 60 days, and (4) affirmative ban ruling. This chain of events has zero historical precedent and contradicts everything we know about German constitutional proceedings. The 1% better represents the true 'black swan' tail risk - an event so unprecedented we can barely conceptualize it (perhaps a major security crisis triggering emergency measures), but not literally zero because politics occasionally produces genuine surprises. The gap between 1% and 2% matters: 2% suggests roughly 'very unlikely but conceivable,' while 1% appropriately captures 'functionally impossible absent extraordinary circumstances.'",
