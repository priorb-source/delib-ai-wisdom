  "information": "As of early June 2025, the U.S. total public debt outstanding is approximately $36.2 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury data cited by multiple news outlets. This figure was reported as having reached $36.216 trillion by January 2025. Estimates of the debt's growth rate vary; one source indicates it is increasing by approximately $1 trillion every 180 days, while another suggests a faster rate of over $1 trillion every 100 days. The debt has grown by more than $13 trillion since 2020.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury Department is currently using 'extraordinary measures' to continue financing the government without breaching the statutory debt limit. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has informed Congress that these measures can be sustained until June 27, 2025. Separately, the Bipartisan Policy Center projects that the 'X-date,' when the government would be at risk of default, will likely occur between mid-July and early October 2025. Following the previous debt ceiling suspension in June 2023, the reported debt figure increased by approximately $360 billion on the next business day and by a total of $600 billion within one week as inter-governmental trust funds were replenished.\n\nThe federal budget deficit for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025, is projected to be $2.2 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a Republican-proposed bill to cut taxes and eliminate certain programs would add an additional $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Interest payments on the debt have become one of the largest federal expenses, exceeding defense spending and projected to surpass $1 trillion annually. According to the Treasury Department, net interest expenditure for the first seven months of the 2025 fiscal year totaled $578.7 billion. In 2025, $9.2 trillion of existing U.S. debt is scheduled to mature, with $6.5 trillion of that amount coming due between January and June.",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "Political gridlock continues, and Congress fails to pass legislation to raise or suspend the debt limit by June 27, 2025. The Treasury continues to use 'extraordinary measures,' which artificially suppresses the publicly reported debt figure. Without the large, one-time upward adjustment from replenishing government trust funds, the debt's regular day-to-day increase is insufficient to reach $37 trillion by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Responding to Treasury Secretary Yellen's deadline, Congress passes and the President signs a bill to suspend the debt limit on or shortly before June 27, 2025. The Treasury then immediately unwinds its 'extraordinary measures,' causing a rapid one-time increase of several hundred billion dollars in the reported debt as intragovernmental trust funds are replenished. This accounting adjustment, combined with ongoing deficit spending, pushes the total public debt figure above $37 trillion.",
    "rationale": "My forecast hinges on the resolution of the debt ceiling standoff and its effect on the reported debt figure. As of early June 2025, the debt is approximately $36.2 trillion, $800 billion shy of the $37 trillion threshold. Based on reported growth rates of $1 trillion per 100-180 days, normal deficit spending over the next 23 days would only add an estimated $130-$230 billion, which is insufficient to reach the target. The critical factor is the Treasury's use of 'extraordinary measures' to avoid breaching the debt limit, which artificially holds down the reported debt total. Secretary Yellen has stated these measures will be exhausted around June 27, 2025, making this date a political forcing event. Historical precedent, such as the resolution in June 2023, shows that once the debt limit is suspended, the reported debt figure jumps immediately and significantly—by as much as $600 billion in a week—as the Treasury replenishes government accounts. The status quo is not just deficit spending, but also the political cycle of brinkmanship that typically results in a last-minute deal. I forecast that such a deal will be reached just before the deadline. A resulting accounting jump of $600 billion, added to the baseline $36.2 trillion and the month's accumulated deficit of ~$200 billion, would place the total debt around $37.0 trillion, thus triggering a 'Yes' outcome. My confidence is not higher because of the inherent unpredictability of Congress; a delay of even a few days past June 27 would push the accounting jump beyond the resolution date, leading to a 'No' outcome. My confidence is not lower because the pressure to avoid a default is immense, making a deal by the Treasury's deadline the most probable scenario. I would update my forecast higher on credible reports of an imminent bipartisan deal and lower on signs of a protracted stalemate extending into July.",
