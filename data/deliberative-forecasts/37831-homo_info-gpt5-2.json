    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my prior view but add a useful detail: the CNT reportedly repealed the existing party law (130–2) and signaled a new framework will be drafted. That legislative sequencing suggests the dissolution wasn’t a one-off decree but part of a deliberate, multi-step consolidation, making a quick reversal even less likely. They also emphasize AES alignment further insulating the junta from ECOWAS-style leverage and note that crafting a new party law typically takes months. I find these points credible and additive. Their tail-risk scenarios (court ruling respected by the junta; sudden mass mobilization; elite fractures; face-saving temporary reinstatement pending a new law) are reasonable but low-likelihood within the 6-week window.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~40 days. The regime’s trajectory (suspending party activity in 2024; now dissolving parties) and arrests of opposition figures point to entrenchment. New information about the CNT’s repeal of the party law and intent to draft a replacement increases the institutional and reputational costs of a rapid reversal. Mali’s exit from ECOWAS and tighter AES/Russia alignment reduces near-term external coercive leverage. Domestic pressure so far appears limited in scale, and Mali’s judiciary is unlikely to force an outcome the executive will honor on this timeline. A Yes outcome would most plausibly come from an unexpected tactical concession—e.g., allowing parties to resume pending a new law—to defuse unrest or unlock support, or from a court ruling the junta chooses to respect. Given the added legislative entrenchment, I slightly lower my estimate.",
