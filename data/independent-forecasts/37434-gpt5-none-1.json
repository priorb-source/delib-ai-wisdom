    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 weeks (roughly 56 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No filing by the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty continues to manage liquidity through cost cuts, small dilutive equity raises (ATM or rights offering), asset sales, or bridge financing. Even if under a going‑concern warning, they avoid a formal U.S. Bankruptcy Code filing at least until after July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The company exhausts cash and lacks access to new financing or asset-sale proceeds, faces imminent obligations (payroll, lease, vendor, or debt) it cannot meet, and files a Chapter 11 (or 7) petition to protect from creditors before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Time window is short. Most distressed microcaps try to avoid bankruptcy through repeated small capital raises, temporary shutdowns, or asset sales, and many can extend runway by weeks or months. That favors the status quo outcome of No over an 8‑week horizon. AquaBounty has long faced financing challenges (project delays, likely going‑concern language historically), which keeps the bankruptcy hazard non‑trivial. However, their model has relied more on equity funding than heavy secured debt, which reduces immediate bankruptcy pressure relative to highly levered peers. If their March 27, 2025 full‑year release had indicated runway well past Q2 2025, the short‑window risk would be quite low; conversely, if it said they needed near‑term financing to continue operations, risk would be higher. With no new specific red‑flag events in hand (e.g., an 8‑K about failed financing, default notices, or a termination of key facilities), base rates and the short timeline argue for a sub‑25% probability. Why not higher: bankruptcy filings are relatively rare over such a brief horizon, and companies often secure last‑minute financing or implement cash preservation measures. Why not lower: persistent financial stress, microcap status, and prior going‑concern context keep a meaningful tail risk of a near‑term filing. What would move me up: disclosures of inability to secure financing, imminent cash‑out dates, creditor enforcement, default notices, or halted operations with no funding plan. What would move me down: confirmed new financing/asset‑sale proceeds extending runway beyond Q3 2025, or explicit management guidance of sufficient liquidity past July 1. Research assistant provided no additional info; therefore I weighted general base rates and typical microcap financing patterns alongside the short time remaining.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill AquaBounty Technologies file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[AquaBounty Technologies Announces Full Year 2024 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603978/000160397825000012/aqb-20250327xex99_1.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
