    "review": "Forecaster 2 rightly elevates reputational and security considerations at a BBC-broadcast, flagship event, and the precedent of other cancellations is a real signal. The point that the June 18 hearing could be a decision catalyst is well taken. However, the analysis seems to over-index on reputational risk translating into an operational ban; Glastonbury can partly mitigate (e.g., non-broadcasting a set) without removing an act, and has historically tolerated political controversy. Forecaster 3 persuasively emphasizes the status quo power: still on the bill, recent UK performances post-charge, and Glastonbury’s cultural identity. The legal argument that a Section 13 display charge is unlikely to yield bail conditions severe enough to block performance is plausible. Where I think F3 underweights risk is the potential for police advisory pressure or last-minute security concerns after the June 18 appearance, and the signaling effect of multiple cancellations (including major European festivals), which could stiffen pressure on Glastonbury even if the legal bar to perform remains low.",
    "rationale": "My prior view (62%) leaned on the strong base rate for announced acts, Glastonbury’s tolerance for political controversy, and the lack of current legal constraints—the band played a surprise London show on May 22 and has another UK festival date proceeding May 24. The June 18 hearing is close but likely leads to bail, not remand; typical Section 13 cases don’t impose broad performance bans. Also, per resolution, a partial lineup performance under the Kneecap name would still count.\n\nI’m modestly updating down for two reasons highlighted in the deliberation: (1) the incremental reputational and security risk tied to the BBC partnership and public ministerial pressure, which makes Glastonbury more exposed than smaller promoters to orchestrated backlash; and (2) the precedent value of multiple cancellations, including major German festivals, which could influence police advice and organizer risk calculus in mid-June. These factors raise the odds of a protective removal decision even absent new legal impediments.\n\nCountervailing factors keep the forecast above 50%: Glastonbury has not signaled a review; operationally, late changes are costly; the legal case is narrow and slow-moving; and UK shows continue post-charge, indicating no immediate legal bar. Netting these, I still expect a Yes to be more likely than not, but with meaningful downside around the June 18 inflection point.",
