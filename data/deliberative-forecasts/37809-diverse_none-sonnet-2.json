    "review": "Both forecasters raised critical points I overlooked. Forecaster 2's mention of Luis Arráez batting .392 on July 1, 2023 is highly relevant recent evidence showing this nearly happened just two years ago—the difference being only 2-3 hits over ~300 at-bats. This concrete example significantly strengthens the case for a higher probability than my initial 10%. Forecaster 3 identified the most important issue: definitional ambiguity. The resolution criteria say 'any Major League Baseball player' without specifying 'qualified' hitters. If non-qualified players count (someone with 40 at-bats going 16-for-40), the probability increases substantially. However, by July 1 (~80 games in), even bench players accumulate meaningful at-bats, reducing small-sample flukes. Forecaster 3's range of 7-10% for qualified vs 85-95% for any player seems too extreme—85-95% vastly overestimates the likelihood of a non-qualified player maintaining .400 with even 50-100 at-bats by July 1. Both forecasters provide reasonable updating triggers around mid-June performance thresholds. The Arráez example is the strongest new evidence, demonstrating this outcome is plausible in the modern era under the right circumstances.",
    "rationale": "My initial 10% underweighted recent precedent. The Arráez case (.392 on July 1, 2023) proves that elite contact hitters can approach .400 deep into the season even in the modern game. This isn't just theoretical—it nearly happened two years ago. However, 'nearly' is key: even an exceptional case fell short, reinforcing the difficulty. The definitional ambiguity matters but less than Forecaster 3 suggests. By July 1, backup players accumulate 50-150 at-bats. A .400 average with 100 at-bats (40 hits) is still extraordinary luck/skill. The probability of some non-qualified player achieving this adds perhaps 2-4 percentage points, not 70+. Weighing factors: (1) Historical base rate remains very low since 1941; (2) Arráez precedent shows modern feasibility; (3) Regression to mean over 250-350 at-bats is powerful; (4) Small definitional boost for non-qualified players; (5) We're 6 weeks from resolution with no current data suggesting someone is near .400 now. Integrating these considerations, I'm updating from 10% to 13%, primarily driven by the Arráez evidence demonstrating this is achievable in recent conditions, with minor adjustment for definitional edge cases.",
