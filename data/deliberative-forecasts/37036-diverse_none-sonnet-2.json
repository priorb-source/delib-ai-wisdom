    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I diverge significantly on how to weight the 'exploring' signal. Forecaster 2 treats this as a strong commitment indicator pushing probability above 50%, emphasizing the momentum and media buzz arguments. However, I find Forecaster 3's counter-arguments more compelling: (1) the critical observation about lack of visible launch infrastructure - no scheduled events, FEC filings, or staff announcements, (2) the base rate argument that 2026 candidates typically announce later in 2025, not in spring, and (3) the semantic distinction that 'exploring' is specifically not announcing and represents a deliberative phase. Forecaster 2's momentum argument has merit, but it's weakened by the 20-day gap since the article with no follow-up reporting. If Osborn were truly on a fast track to announcement, we'd expect to see concrete signals by now. The absence of such signals is informative.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I remain at 40%. While Forecaster 2 raises valid points about capitalizing on media attention, three factors keep me from moving upward: (1) The core evidence remains a single article from 20 days ago with no subsequent developments - if momentum were building toward an imminent announcement, we'd likely see additional reporting, staff hires, or FEC activity; (2) Base rates matter - for a 2026 midterm election, announcing in April/May 2025 is unusually early, and most serious candidates announce in late summer or fall to better time fundraising and campaign cycles; (3) The 38-day window is actually quite compressed for moving from exploration to formal announcement, especially for a challenger who needs to assemble infrastructure. Forecaster 3's alignment with my assessment validates that 40% appropriately balances the meaningful signal of exploration against the strong status quo bias and lack of concrete launch preparations. I see no new evidence or arguments compelling enough to adjust from this position.",
