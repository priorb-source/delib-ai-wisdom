  "information": "Airlines increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025. Jet2.com announced it would offer 1.6 million seats for the summer season, an 8% increase from 2024, with new routes from Bournemouth and London-Luton starting in April. Vueling offered over 145,000 seats to and from the islands for the Easter period, a 10% increase from the previous year. Air Nostrum increased its seat offerings by 7% for the same period. Binter also launched new routes from Córdoba to Gran Canaria starting in mid-April 2025.\n\nPassenger arrival data for the Canary Islands showed year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2025. AENA reported that traffic in the Canary Islands grew by 3.6% in Q1 2025 compared to Q1 2024. Monthly data showed a 2.2% increase in February and another 2.2% increase in March compared to the same months in 2024. The Easter holiday period in 2025 fell entirely within April, whereas in 2024, it was in late March.\n\nOn April 28, 2025, a massive power outage occurred on the Iberian Peninsula, affecting mainland Spain and Portugal. While the Canary Islands' power grid was not directly hit, the event caused significant disruptions to air travel. Reports indicated that air traffic at major hubs was operating at reduced capacity, leading to widespread flight delays and cancellations. Canary Islands airports experienced knock-on effects, with numerous flights connecting to the mainland being cancelled or delayed. One government official stated that 344 out of 6,000 scheduled flights in Spain were cancelled on that day.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The data for April 2025 is expected to be published in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - April 2025 arrivals will be equal to or higher than April 2024",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The strong capacity increases from multiple airlines (7-10% growth), the positive trend from Q1 2025 (2.2-3.6% growth), and the crucial timing of Easter falling entirely within April 2025 (versus late March 2024) combine to drive passenger arrivals above April 2024 levels. The late-month power outage has only minimal impact, affecting 2-3 days at the end of April.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The April 28 power outage has more severe and prolonged knock-on effects than initially reported, causing significant flight cancellations and delays in the final days of April. This disruption, combined with potential unreported factors like weather issues or other operational problems, is sufficient to offset the otherwise positive trends and Easter timing advantage.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors a NO resolution. Three major factors point to growth: (1) Airlines substantially increased capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025, with Jet2.com up 8%, Vueling up 10%, and Air Nostrum up 7%; (2) Q1 2025 showed consistent year-over-year growth of 2.2-3.6%; (3) Most importantly, Easter 2025 fell entirely within April, while Easter 2024 was in late March - this calendar effect should provide a significant boost to April 2025 numbers as Easter is a major travel period. The primary risk is the April 28 power outage on the Iberian Peninsula. However, this occurred very late in the month (only 2-3 days remaining), affected only 5.7% of Spanish flights that day, and the Canary Islands weren't directly hit. Even assuming worst-case scenarios where disruptions lasted multiple days and disproportionately affected Canary Islands routes, this would likely impact only 1-2% of the month's total traffic. The Easter timing advantage alone should outweigh this disruption. I'm not lower because the power outage is a real concern with potential cascading effects, and there could be other unreported disruptions. I'm not higher because the fundamental growth trends, capacity increases, and Easter timing create very strong headwinds against a decline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAirlines increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025.
