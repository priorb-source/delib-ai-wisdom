    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I have fundamentally different interpretations of the base rate. Forecaster 2 argues that Trump's attendance pattern is 'exceptionally strong' and requires specific negative evidence to forecast against, leading to a 75% probability. However, this inverts the proper forecasting logic. Even enthusiastic UFC attendees don't go to most events - with ~12 numbered PPVs annually, attending 75% would mean 9+ events per year, which seems implausibly high for a sitting president. Forecaster 3's estimate of 1-3 attendances per year (8-25% base rate) aligns much better with historical patterns and my own reasoning. Forecaster 2's recent attendance evidence (Apr 13) is already incorporated in all our forecasts, but doesn't override the fundamental base rate that most UFC events occur without presidential attendance. Forecaster 3 and I converged independently on similar probability ranges (20-25%), which strengthens confidence in this range. The lack of specific information about UFC 316's date, location, and card quality means we must rely primarily on base rates, which clearly favor non-attendance.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I believe my original reasoning was sound and Forecaster 3's complementary analysis reinforces it. The key insight is that Trump's attendance at 1-3 UFC PPVs per year out of ~12 creates a base rate of approximately 8-25% per event. The April 13 attendance proves presidential attendance is feasible but also suggests satiation - having just attended, he may be less likely to attend another soon. Forecaster 2's 75% forecast treats attendance as the default rather than the exception, which contradicts the numerical reality that most UFC events don't feature Trump. Without specific positive indicators (confirmed favorable location, Dana White announcements, schedule alignment, marquee card), the forecast should remain anchored to the base rate. I'm adjusting slightly upward from 20% to 23% to account for the demonstrated feasibility and Trump's active engagement with UFC, but not substantially higher given the absence of UFC 316-specific information.",
