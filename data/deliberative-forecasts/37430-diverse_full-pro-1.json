    "review": "My initial forecast of 65% was based on the bill's strong political momentum, particularly its passage in the House of Representatives and backing from the executive. I viewed the missed Q1 2025 deadline as a minor setback. However, the other forecasters have provided compelling reasons to be more cautious. Forecaster 2 (45%) rightly emphasizes that the missed deadline is a significant negative signal, suggesting deeper friction or 'substantive opposition' that I may have underestimated. Their framing of the 'notoriously unpredictable' Nigerian legislative process and 'status quo bias' serves as a valuable check on my optimism. Forecaster 3 (58%) introduced a crucial, concrete detail I overlooked: the legislative calendar will be compressed by the Eid al-Adha break in June. This dramatically shortens the effective time remaining for the Senate to pass the bill, harmonize it if necessary, and get it to the President for assent. This specific calendar risk, combined with the general risk of delays highlighted by Forecaster 2, makes a slip past the July 1 deadline considerably more plausible.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 65% to 55%. While I still believe passage is the most likely outcome due to the bill clearing the House and having strong executive and industry support, the deliberation has convinced me that the risks of delay are greater than I initially assessed. The most decisive new piece of information was Forecaster 3's point about the Eid al-Adha holiday in June compressing the legislative timeline. This makes the less-than-two-month window before the deadline much tighter in practice. Combined with Forecaster 2's valid argument that the already-missed Q1 deadline is a strong indicator of existing procedural friction and potential for further delays, the path to enactment before July 1 appears more fraught. The opposition from labor unions, while not focused on this specific provision, adds another layer of potential complexity that could slow the entire package in the Senate. My updated forecast of 55% reflects a belief that passage is still more likely than not, but gives a substantial 45% probability to the bill being derailed or, more likely, delayed beyond the deadline by these combined procedural and calendar-related risks.",
