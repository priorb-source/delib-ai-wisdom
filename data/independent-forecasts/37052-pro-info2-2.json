  "information": "According to the University of Illinois Cline Center’s Coup d'État Project, the number of coups, attempts, and conspiracies has risen since 2021 to 14-16 events per year, compared to single-digit figures in the 2000s and 2010s. However, these figures remain below the averages of the 1960s and 1970s. The number of successful coups was seven in 2021 and five in 2024. A summary of historical data from the reports indicates that from 2020 to early 2025, Africa experienced nine notable coup events, of which seven were successful. Over a similar period, from 2022 to 2024, Latin America had three notable coup events, all of which were unsuccessful.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two months and one week, as of April 25, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No successful coup occurs in any country in Africa or Latin America by the deadline, and the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing political tensions in several at-risk nations, particularly in the Sahel region, governments maintain stability and control over their security forces. Any coup attempts that materialize are unsuccessful, similar to the recent failed attempt in Bolivia, and no leader successfully executes a self-coup before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A military faction in a politically volatile African nation, such as Chad or another country experiencing spillover instability from the 'coup belt', successfully overthrows the government. The coup leaders rapidly consolidate power, secure control of the state apparatus, and face no significant organized resistance, leading to a successful seizure of power before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on an analysis of the base rate of recent coups, concentrated regional instability, and the very short time frame for this question. According to the provided data, Africa has seen a significant number of successful coups since 2021, averaging more than one per year (e.g., Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso x2, Niger, Gabon). Latin America, in contrast, has seen several attempts but no successes, indicating a lower probability for that region. Applying a simple base rate of ~1.4 successful coups per year in Africa to the remaining ~2.2-month period yields a baseline probability of around 25%. I am adjusting this upward to 30%. The rationale for this adjustment is the acute and ongoing instability concentrated in Africa's Sahel region, where a 'contagion' effect seems to be at play. The underlying drivers—poor governance, economic hardship, and insurgency—remain potent, meaning the conditions for a coup are ripe and such an event could occur with little warning. My forecast is not higher primarily due to the very short time window. Coups are still relatively rare events on any given day, and a two-month period significantly constrains the likelihood of one occurring. My forecast is not lower because ignoring the clear and persistent trend of successful coups in Africa would be a mistake. The region is more volatile now than it has been in decades. I would increase my forecast upon credible reports of significant military mobilization or high-level arrests in a vulnerable country. I would decrease it if a major political crisis in a hotspot nation were to be peacefully resolved.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to [Powell & Thyne (2011, p. 252)](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf), a coup is \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\" In recent years, some of the coups in Africa have been:&#x20;\n\n* [Mali August 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Mali May 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Niger March 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Nigerien_coup_attempt) (attempt)\n* [Niger July 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nigerien_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Gabon August 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Gabonese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Chad January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%27Djamena_attack) (possible attempt)\n* [Burkina Faso January 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Burkina Faso September 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)&#x20;\n* [Guinea September 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n\nLatin America has had the following coup attempts in recent years:\n\n* [Peru self-coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Peruvian_self-coup_attempt), December 2022\n* [Brazil Congress attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack), January 2023\n* [Bolivia coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bolivian_coup_attempt), June 2024\n\nSee also: [VoA by the numbers Coups in Africa](https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is a successful coup d’état in any country on the African continent or Latin America before July 1, 2025, according to credible media reports. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nLatin America is defined as any country in North America or South America whose primary language is Spanish, Portuguese or French.\n\nA coup d’état (often shortened to \"coup\") is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) as an event in which a state's military or other components of its power structure overthrow the existing political authority.&#x20;\n\nA \"successful\" coup is defined as a coup in which the group or person attempting to seize power establishes control over both the government and military, and will be considered to have succeeded once any significant resistance to their authority has ceased.&#x20;\n\nA self-coup, [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup) as a political leader, having come to power through legal means, remaining in power through illegal means, will count. This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the University of Illinois Cline Center’s Coup d'État Project, the number of coups, attempts, and conspiracies has risen since 2021 to 14-16 events per year, compared to single-digit figures in the 2000s and 2010s.
