    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the high probability of a 'Yes' outcome, with forecasts ranging from 85% to 95%. All three of us correctly identified the very low threshold of five additional fatalities as the core driver of the forecast. Forecaster 2 provided a useful quantification of the recent casualty rate (~0.36 per day), which confirms the threshold will be met quickly under status quo conditions. Forecaster 2 also introduced a key argument I hadn't explicitly weighted: the possibility that OCHA stops publishing new reports, which would lock in the current number and resolve the question as 'No'. Forecaster 3 made a compelling argument that the threshold is so low that even a significant de-escalation, short of a complete halt in hostilities, would likely still result in five more fatalities before July 1. This strengthens the case for a very high probability.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 90%. After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am making a slight upward adjustment. I was particularly convinced by Forecaster 3's argument that the bar for a 'No' outcome is exceptionally high. Not only would a ceasefire be required, but it would need to be so effective as to prevent just five casualties among UN staff over nearly two months in a volatile post-conflict environment. Given the intelligence about a planned intensification of military operations, this seems extremely unlikely. Forecaster 2's point about a potential halt in OCHA reporting is a valid downside risk, but I assess it as a low-probability event, as this reporting is a core function of their mission. Weighing these two points, I believe Forecaster 3's argument for a higher probability is more impactful than Forecaster 2's argument for a lower one. The combined probability of a sudden and durable ceasefire plus a halt in reporting seems small. Therefore, I am increasing my confidence from 90% to 93%, as a 7% chance of 'No' feels more appropriate to cover these distinct but unlikely scenarios.",
