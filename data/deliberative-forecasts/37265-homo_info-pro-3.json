    "review": "The other two forecasters provide excellent and converging analyses, both arriving at 20%. Our core reasoning is aligned: the high inertia of State Department advisories and the very short timeframe make the status quo (Level 2) the most likely outcome. Forecaster 2 introduces a crucial piece of evidence I hadn't explicitly considered: the existing Level 3 advisory for the specific Mtwara region. This is a powerful point, as it demonstrates the State Department's preference for a granular, regional approach to contain specific threats, which strengthens the argument against a country-wide upgrade. Forecaster 3 provides a compelling counterargument by citing the Level 3 advisories for regional neighbors like Uganda and Burundi. This establishes a clear precedent that the types of threats present in Tanzania (terrorism, violent crime) are sufficient to trigger a Level 3 advisory in the region, which strengthens the argument for a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my initial forecast of 15%. The deliberation has introduced two strong, but largely opposing, pieces of evidence that help clarify the key drivers. Forecaster 2's point about the Mtwara-specific Level 3 advisory is the most direct evidence of how the State Department is currently handling the primary security threat to Tanzania. Their choice to issue a targeted warning, rather than a country-wide one, suggests they view the risk as localized. This makes a blanket upgrade for the entire country less likely, as there is already a mechanism in place to warn travelers about the highest-risk area. For a country-wide change, a new, widespread threat would need to emerge or the existing Mtwara situation would need to escalate dramatically to be perceived as a national-level threat. The short two-month timeframe makes such a significant deterioration a low-probability event. At the same time, Forecaster 3's argument about regional precedents is why my forecast is not lower. It confirms that the State Department is willing to use the Level 3 designation for these threats in East Africa. This creates a realistic, non-zero probability of an upgrade should a significant triggering event occur. On balance, the specific evidence of the State Department's targeted approach to Tanzania's current risks outweighs the general regional comparison, leading me to hold my forecast at 15%, a small but meaningful distance from the consensus 20%.",
