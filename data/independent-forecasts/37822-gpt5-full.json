  "information": "In late April 2025, during a series of town hall meetings, Beto O'Rourke stated that he would consider running for the U.S. Senate if it aligns with the desires of Texas voters. Quoted in multiple outlets such as Fox News, The Hill, and Yahoo, he said, 'If it comes to pass that this is what the people of Texas want, that it's the highest and best use of what I can give to you, then yes, I will.' As of late May 2025, O'Rourke had not filed any formal candidacy papers with the FEC and no campaign infrastructure or exploratory committee was visible. He continues his work with the voter mobilization organization 'Powered by People,' which he founded in 2019.\n\nThe 2026 Texas U.S. Senate election features incumbent Republican Senator John Cornyn seeking a fifth term. Cornyn faces a primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has already announced his campaign. On the Democratic side, while O'Rourke is publicly considering a run, other figures like former Congressman Colin Allred have also been mentioned as potential candidates, though none had formally entered the race as of late May 2025.\n\nHistorical timelines for major Texas campaigns show variation. For the 2024 Senate race, Democrat Colin Allred announced his candidacy in May 2023, 17 months before the election. Beto O'Rourke's own record includes announcing his 2018 Senate bid 20 months early (March 2017) and his 2022 gubernatorial run 12 months early (November 2021). The question's deadline of July 1, 2025, is approximately 16 months prior to the November 2026 general election.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — there has been no announcement to date, and absent a new development he is unlikely to declare within the short remaining window.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "O’Rourke continues signaling openness (“if Texans want it”) while focusing on Powered by People; he defers a decision until later in 2025 (e.g., late summer/fall) closer to the December filing deadline, or ultimately opts not to run.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He leverages the June 30 end-of-quarter fundraising deadline and announces in June with a digital/video rollout and media hits to post a strong Q2 haul and clear the Democratic field early.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: As of late May 2025, there has been no formal announcement, no FEC filing, and no visible campaign infrastructure or exploratory committee. With only ~6 weeks left, the default outcome is No.\n- Signals so far: In late April he publicly said he’d run if that’s what Texans want (“yes, I will”), which keeps the option live but is conditional and non-committal. He remains focused on Powered by People. No credible reports of staff hires or ramp-up have surfaced.\n- Timing considerations: Announcing by July 1, 2025 would be ~16–17 months before the 2026 general—well within normal windows (e.g., O’Rourke announced his 2018 Senate bid ~20 months out; his 2022 governor run ~12 months out; Colin Allred announced for 2024 Senate ~18 months out). So a June 2025 launch is plausible.\n- Incentives to announce before July 1: The June 30 FEC quarter-end offers a natural forcing function to demonstrate fundraising strength out of the gate. That is the main near-term reason to expect a June announcement.\n- Incentives to wait: Texas’s filing deadline will likely be December 2025, leaving ample time to decide and build. O’Rourke may want to assess GOP dynamics (Cornyn vs. Paxton), recruit/clear the Democratic field, and line up endorsements and staff before declaring. Given no visible groundwork yet, waiting is unsurprising.\n- Competitive context: The GOP primary drama could make the race look more enticing for Democrats, but it does not by itself force an announcement in the next 40 days.\n- Why not higher: Lack of observable pre-launch activity; conditional language; short runway to July 1; no necessity to announce this early given December filing deadline.\n- Why not lower: Clear public openness to running; historical precedent for early launches; strong name recognition and network make a quick June rollout feasible; Q2 fundraising deadline provides a near-term catalyst.\n- What would move me up: Credible Texas/ national reporting of staff hires, domain/branding moves, FEC committee formation, scheduled statewide tour or press event, or prominent Democrats signaling imminent entry. Strong internal or public polling leaks showing him competitive could also accelerate a launch.\n- What would move me down: Public statements indicating he’ll decide later in the year, reports he’s ruled it out, another prominent Democrat launching with signals O’Rourke will not run, or continued absence of staffing/organizational tells through mid-June.",
