    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: Stoney is the nominal frontrunner on fundraising, a small polling edge, and establishment/geo-base advantages; Rouse is a live underdog with a clear Hampton Roads base and strong labor/progressive support in a low-turnout, multi-candidate, plurality contest. Forecaster 2’s 35% aligns with my initial view. Forecaster 3’s 23% is defensible but, in my view, slightly over-weights the fundraising/polling edge relative to the massive undecided share and the volatility of a six-way field. The most useful additional emphasis from their analyses is the decisive role of paid media in the DC market given NoVA’s size and the lack of a high-profile local candidate there—this likely amplifies Stoney’s cash advantage in the closing weeks. Neither added materially new facts beyond the internal poll, fundraising, and endorsements, but the DC-market leverage is a nuance I’m elevating slightly in my weighting.",
    "rationale": "Baseline remains: Stoney is ahead on money, a small early poll lead (internal), and endorsements; Rouse’s path requires maximizing Hampton Roads, translating union/progressive backing into superior GOTV, holding his own in NoVA, and benefiting from Stoney/Hashmi splitting the Richmond area. The six-way field lowers the winning threshold and keeps Rouse viable. However, with three weeks left and no evidence of a Rouse surge, Stoney’s cash edge—especially for the expensive NoVA media market—likely matters more now than earlier, and additional lower-tier candidates could siphon some progressive/anti-establishment votes that might otherwise accrue to Rouse. Given this, I’m trimming modestly from my prior. I would move up if credible public polling shows Rouse tied/leading, evidence of substantial DC-market ad presence for Rouse appears, or major late endorsements/union expansions land. I would move down if new polling shows Stoney opening a wider lead, late money gaps widen, or clear signs emerge that NoVA and Richmond are consolidating behind Stoney.",
