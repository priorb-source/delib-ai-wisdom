  "information": "Historical data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) shows the following counts of reported sightings for the month of June: 357 in 2019, 470 in 2020, 407 in 2021, and 603 in 2022. While specific numbers for June 2023 and June 2024 were not provided in the source material, data tables indicated that all reported months in 2023 exceeded 600 reports and all reported months in 2024 exceeded 450 reports. For the current year, a data scrape on May 22, 2025, showed a total of 2,067 sighting reports for January through April 2025, yielding a monthly average of approximately 517. Each of ahe first four months of 2025 individually exceeded 400 reports.\n\nBetween May 2023 and June 2024, the US government documented 757 reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), with 708 of them occurring in the air. Of these, only 49 cases were officially closed. A notable number of these sightings occurred near the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly in Arizona. Media reports have covered recent military-related incidents, including a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet that was struck and damaged by an object over Arizona in January 2023. In a separate event from September 2024, a US Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with an object traveling at Mach 2 during a mission in California.\n\nPublic interest in UFO-related topics is supported by ongoing events and media attention. The 11th annual 'Contact in the Desert' conference, a major gathering for UFO experts and enthusiasts, is scheduled to run from May 29 to June 2, 2025, in California. Regionally, Washington state ranks third in the U.S. for the total number of UFO reports submitted to NUFORC, and several sightings have been reported from the state's Columbia Basin region since the beginning of 2025. The topic of UAPs also continues to receive attention from mainstream news outlets and the U.S. Congress.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5.5 weeks until July 1, 2025 (when Metaculus will first check), with resolution soon after.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — recent NUFORC monthly volumes comfortably exceed 400, and summer months tend to be stronger.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A material disruption or change at NUFORC (website outage, intake pause, policy/method change, or a large de-duplication sweep) depresses the displayed June 2025 count to ≤400 as of early July; alternatively, an anomalously weak reporting month with a sustained daily pace below ~13 reports/day.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Normal operations continue and the Jan–Apr 2025 run rate (~17/day, 2,067 total) persists or rises with typical summer seasonality and media-driven interest, keeping June’s displayed count well above 400 when checked on/after July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates and recent trend: The RA reports June counts of 357 (2019), 470 (2020), 407 (2021), and 603 (2022). More recently, all months in 2023 reportedly exceeded 600, all months in 2024 exceeded 450, and each of Jan–Apr 2025 exceeded 400, totaling 2,067 (avg ~517/month, ~17.2/day). The status quo therefore implies a comfortable margin above 400 in June 2025.\n- Seasonality and attention: Summer months typically see higher reporting (more outdoor time, clearer skies). June has historically been at or above threshold in recent years (notably 2022 at 603). Media attention and events (e.g., Contact in the Desert, late May–early June) plausibly nudge reporting upward at the margin.\n- Threshold math: June needs >400 over 30 days (~13.3/day). Jan–Apr 2025 averaged ~17/day, giving a cushion of ~30% above the needed rate even without a summer bump.\n- Why not higher than my forecast: Small but real risks remain: (1) NUFORC operational or technical issues; (2) data-processing changes (de-duplication or stricter criteria) reducing displayed counts; (3) the RA’s 2023–2024 summary could be slightly overstated; (4) reporting lags as of early July, though the criterion allows checks on or after July 1, mitigating lag risk.\n- Why not lower: The multi-year trend and early-2025 volumes give a solid base rate well above the threshold. A one-month crash below 400 would be a sharp deviation from the past ~16+ consecutive months reportedly ≥450 (2024) and the 2025 pace.\n- Update triggers:\n  • Up: If late May and early-to-mid June daily filings visibly exceed ~17/day, or NUFORC highlights increased activity; if media attention spikes.  \n  • Down: Any announced NUFORC intake pause, methodology change, extended site outage, or observed June pace <13/day by mid-month; credible evidence that 2024/2025 volumes were overstated.\nGiven the strong status quo and modest operational risks, the probability is high but not near-certain.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of UFO sightings reported by the National UFO Reporting Center exceed 400 for June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts greater than 400 UFO/UAP sighting reports at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) for the month of June 2025, as displayed when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) shows the following counts of reported sightings for the month of June: 357 in 2019, 470 in 2020, 407 in 2021, and 603 in 2022.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
