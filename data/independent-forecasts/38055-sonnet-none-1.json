    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The exact date of UFC 316 is not specified in the available information, but as a numbered UFC event in 2025, it is likely scheduled within the next few months. Best estimate is 1-4 months from today (May 26, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo is that Joe Pyfer has a rebooked fight scheduled at UFC 316 against Kelvin Gastelum. If this fight proceeds as planned, the outcome depends on fight performance.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Pyfer does not fight at UFC 316 (due to injury, opponent withdrawal without replacement, or card changes) OR Pyfer fights but loses the bout via decision, knockout, or submission OR the fight ends in a draw/no contest.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Joe Pyfer steps into the octagon at UFC 316 against Kelvin Gastelum or a replacement opponent and wins via knockout, technical knockout, submission, or decision.",
    "rationale": "According to the Sports Illustrated article, Joe Pyfer vs Kelvin Gastelum has been rebooked for UFC 316 after a previous Mexico cancellation. This suggests the fight is currently scheduled. Key uncertainties: (1) Fight completion rate - UFC fights are cancelled 10-20% of the time due to injuries or other factors. Since this is already a rebooked fight, it may carry slightly higher cancellation risk. (2) Pyfer's win probability if the fight occurs - Without current detailed information on both fighters' recent form, records, and rankings, I must estimate conservatively. Gastelum is a UFC veteran who has fought top competition. Pyfer is positioned as a competitive matchup. (3) Replacement opponent possibility - If Gastelum withdraws, a replacement could be found, though this introduces additional uncertainty about matchup difficulty. My forecast is not higher because: there's meaningful cancellation risk for an already-rebooked fight, and even if it occurs, Pyfer faces a credible opponent in Gastelum without clear information suggesting he's a heavy favorite. My forecast is not lower because: the fight appears actively scheduled, Pyfer is presumably competitive at this level to be booked on a numbered UFC card, and even if this specific opponent changes, fighting 'someone' at the event is reasonably likely. To update higher: confirmation of fight proceeding smoothly, favorable betting odds for Pyfer, or news of his strong recent performances. To update lower: injury reports, news of further postponements, or information suggesting Gastelum or a replacement is heavily favored.",
