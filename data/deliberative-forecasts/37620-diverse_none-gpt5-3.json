    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a useful historical reminder: Kadyrov made similar “I want to step down” statements in 2017, 2018, and 2022 without leaving, which strengthens the status quo prior. They also foreground health rumors as the main upside risk, which I agree with. Forecaster 3’s framing is close to mine: short window, entrenched position, and no concrete follow-up a week after the statement. Neither brings fundamentally new evidence beyond the pattern of past statements, but F2’s emphasis on repeated theatrics nudges me slightly more cautious on near-term change.\n",
    "rationale": "My prior 20% leaned on: (a) unusual public signal from Kadyrov on May 6; (b) persistent health concerns that could force a rapid change; (c) the fact that in Russia a resignation and acting appointment can be executed quickly by decree. The countervailing forces remain strong: extremely short timeline (~19 days), Kadyrov’s longstanding centrality to Kremlin control, the need to manage succession in a sensitive region, and the absence of immediate follow-through or credible successor chatter nearly a week later. Forecaster 2’s point that nearly identical statements have occurred multiple times without action, and are often theater, reinforces the default. Given no new concrete signals since May 6 and the repeated-history context, I’m trimming slightly downward. I’d move up quickly on credible reports of acute health deterioration, hospitalization, or Kremlin/Chechen parliamentary steps toward a handover; I’d move down on explicit denials or sustained normal public activity by Kadyrov through late May.\n",
