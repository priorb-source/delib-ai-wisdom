  "information": "In a January 2025 address to the diplomatic corps, President Alassane Ouattara stated he was in 'perfect health and ready to continue serving my country', but clarified that he had 'not yet made a decision' regarding a candidacy in the October 2025 presidential election. He noted that his party, the RHDP, has at least a dozen potential candidates. Previously, in 2020, Ouattara had announced his intention to step down but reversed this decision to run for a third term after the sudden death of his designated successor.\n\nPresident Ouattara's party, the RHDP, has referred to him as its 'natural candidate' and has been calling for him to run since 2024. In late December 2024, Minister of State Anne Désirée Ouloto announced Ouattara would be the candidate. Similarly, in early January 2025, Minister of Transport Amadou KONÉ stated that Ouattara 'will be the candidate of the RHDP in October 2025.' In late April 2025, a supporter group, the Jeunesse pour la Renaissance du Grand Nord (JRGN), held a press conference publicly calling on Ouattara to run.\n\nSeveral key opposition figures face eligibility challenges ahead of the 2025 election. In late April 2025, a court ruled that potential challenger Tidjane Thiam, leader of the PDCI party, was ineligible to run for president due to his French nationality. Former President Laurent Gbagbo was excluded from electoral lists in 2023 following a conviction for embezzlement. Another political figure, Guillaume Soro, remains in exile and is ineligible due to a 2021 conviction; in April 2025, a trial began for his former aide-de-camp for an alleged coup attempt against Ouattara.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until end of May 31, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — he does not personally declare before June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ouattara maintains ambiguity and delays any personal declaration until closer to the formal nomination/filing window (likely summer), even as RHDP figures continue to signal he will be the candidate.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "RHDP convenes an extraordinary congress or major rally in May and Ouattara personally accepts the party’s nomination or explicitly states he will run; or he makes a direct announcement in a nationally covered speech/interview before June 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and timing: In 2020, Ouattara announced his bid on August 6 for an October election, suggesting a tendency to declare relatively late. With an October 2025 election, a May declaration would be unusually early by his past pattern and by regional practice.\n- Current signals: According to the research assistant, ministers and party figures have for months said he will be the RHDP candidate, and in January 2025 Ouattara said he was in good health but had “not yet made a decision.” As of late April, supporters are publicly urging him to run. However, the resolution criterion requires that he personally declare. Third-party statements do not resolve the question, which lowers the near-term likelihood.\n- Incentives to delay: Early declaration could invite prolonged opposition mobilization (recalling tensions in 2020). Keeping options open preserves leverage over succession dynamics and reduces time for intra-party jockeying. With leading opposition figures facing eligibility obstacles (e.g., Thiam ruled ineligible; Gbagbo excluded; Soro in exile), there is less pressure to declare early.\n- Incentives to announce early: If RHDP schedules a May congress that formalizes his nomination, or if he aims to quell internal uncertainty and consolidate the party behind him, he could choose to announce in May. Ministers’ confident statements imply a high chance he ultimately runs, which keeps a non-trivial chance of a May declaration.\n- Why not higher: No public indication of a scheduled May nomination congress; Ouattara’s own January framing that he hadn’t decided; past late declaration; and strategic reasons to compress the campaign window point to waiting beyond May.\n- Why not lower: Persistent, explicit signaling from senior RHDP officials that he “will be” the candidate raises the chance of a choreographed May announcement. A major rally or set-piece event could trigger a formal declaration.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of an RHDP congress or nomination event set in May; leaks that Ouattara has decided; an official teaser that he will address the nation on his political future in May.\n- What would move me down: Continued statements from Ouattara that he hasn’t decided; scheduling of party selection events for June or later; signs of grooming/launching an alternative RHDP figure without a May timeline.",
