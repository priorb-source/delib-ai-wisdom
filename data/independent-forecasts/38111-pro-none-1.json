    "no_outcome_scenario": "The diplomatic initiative by France and the UK stalls or is delayed. The countries involved decide to wait for other nations to join their coalition, or face domestic or international pressure (e.g., from the US or Israel) to postpone the announcement. June 2025 passes with ongoing discussions but no formal act of recognition.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the announcement of their joint initiative in May, France, the UK, or another country they have influenced, formalizes its new diplomatic position and officially announces its recognition of Palestine. This could be a coordinated move by a group of nations to maximize political impact.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the provided background information indicating that the UK has joined a French-led initiative for the recognition of a Palestinian state. This is a very strong signal of impending policy change from two permanent members of the UN Security Council. Such initiatives are typically launched to build momentum and often have a relatively short timeframe to maintain it. The month immediately following the announcement of the initiative (June 2025) is a highly plausible window for a formal declaration to demonstrate commitment and capitalize on the political momentum.\n\nMy probability is not higher because 'joining an initiative' does not equate to a binding commitment to a specific date. Diplomatic processes are complex and can be subject to delays. Significant pressure from allies, particularly the United States, or an unforeseen change in the geopolitical landscape could push the recognition beyond the June 2025 timeframe.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the trend of recognition has been accelerating, as seen with Spain, Ireland, and Norway in 2024. A joint initiative by France and the UK represents a major escalation of this trend, making inaction in the short term less likely. Failing to act after such a public declaration would carry a diplomatic cost.\n\nI would increase my forecast if other European countries (e.g., Belgium, Slovenia, Malta) publicly state their intent to recognize in June. I would decrease it if high-level officials from France or the UK introduce new, difficult-to-meet preconditions for recognition or explicitly signal a longer timeline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a UN member country newly recognize Palestine in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[UK joins France's initiative for recognition of Palestinian state](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/05/20/uk-joins-france-s-initiative-for-recognition-of-palestinian-state_6741456_4.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, a UN member country announces that it recognizes Palestine as a sovereign nation. Resolves based on Al Jazeera's [tracking page](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/10/mapping-which-countries-recognise-palestine-in-2025) or other credible sources should the tracking page not be timely updated.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
