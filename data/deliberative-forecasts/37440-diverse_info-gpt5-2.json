    "review": "- New info I hadn’t incorporated: CS/HB 1381 was withdrawn May 3 and the current extension is budget-focused. That’s a strong procedural signal against near‑term passage and makes a special session the only realistic path.\n- I’m cautious about Forecaster 3’s claim that DeSantis signed election bills in May 2025 as evidence for this item; unless those bills themselves contain a documentary proof-of-citizenship requirement, their passage more likely signals that leadership chose other election priorities this session.\n- I agree with both that GOP control and gubernatorial willingness to use special sessions keep a nontrivial path to Yes alive; however, the late-session withdrawal plus NVRA/legal risk makes that path narrow.\n- Overall, Forecaster 2’s procedural emphasis is convincing and pushes me down from my prior; Forecaster 3’s focus on favorable politics without concrete bill status doesn’t offset the timing hurdle.",
    "rationale": "Time left is ~56 days. The regular session ended without enacting a proof-of-citizenship requirement, and CS/HB 1381’s withdrawal indicates leadership either lacked consensus or deprioritized the issue. Any new enactment before July 1 now requires a special session or expanding the scope of the budget extension—both uncommon for a litigation-prone issue that failed to move in regular session.\n\nPolitical alignment (GOP supermajorities, DeSantis’s track record, national GOP pressure incl. the SAVE Act and a federal EO) keeps a plausible path: the governor could call a quick special session and pass a narrow requirement applying to a subset of voters (which would satisfy resolution). Conditional on passage, enactment before July 1 is straightforward. But the same factors that may have stalled the bill—NVRA conflict risk and recent preference for back-end database checks over documentary proof—also cut against rapid action now. If leadership wanted this urgently, it likely would have moved before Sine Die or been included in any election package already sent to the governor.\n\nUpside triggers: public notice of a special session on elections/citizenship; leadership statements committing to pass proof-of-citizenship; evidence that HB 831 or equivalent already cleared one chamber and is slated for immediate action. Downside triggers: adjournment of the budget extension without expanding scope; explicit leadership statements to punt to 2026; confirmation that signed 2025 election bills excluded any documentary proof requirement.\n\nGiven the new procedural signals, I’m lowering my estimate from 38% to 20%.",
