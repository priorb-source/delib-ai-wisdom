    "review": "Both other forecasters arrived at the same 5% probability, and their reasoning is highly aligned with my own. The core arguments are identical across all three analyses: (1) the recently-elected government's explicit gradualist platform, (2) the overwhelming economic dependence on Denmark which underpins that platform, (3) the extremely short timeframe of less than two months, and (4) the establishment of a commission with a multi-year mandate, signaling a deliberate process. Forecaster 2's characterization of public support for independence as 'soft and conditional' was a particularly sharp articulation of the polling data. Forecaster 3's mention of 'political incentives' effectively captured why the government is unlikely to deviate from its electoral mandate. No new evidence was presented that I hadn't considered, but the strong consensus and the clarity of their arguments reinforces my confidence in the initial assessment. The fact that three independent analyses converged on the exact same probability based on the same set of facts suggests this is a robust conclusion.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. The deliberation with the other forecasters has strengthened my conviction in this low probability. The Greenlandic government, just elected in March 2025 on a platform of gradualism, has a clear mandate to prioritize economic development over a hasty push for political independence. Given that Greenland's budget is roughly 50% funded by a Danish block grant, and public support for independence is contingent on maintaining living standards, the government has every political incentive to follow this cautious, long-term path. Announcing a referendum date in the next seven weeks would directly contradict their core strategy and electoral promises. Historical precedent and the creation of a negotiation commission with a multi-year mandate further underscore that this is not a process that will be rushed. The probability is not zero because politics can be volatile; a major external shock or an unexpected domestic political maneuver to appease the strengthened pro-independence opposition could lead to a symbolic announcement. However, the fundamental barriers—the government's stated policy, economic reality, and the compressed timeline—make such an outcome extremely unlikely.",
