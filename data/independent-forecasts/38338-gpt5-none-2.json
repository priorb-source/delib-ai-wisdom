    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 24 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no announcement is made before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Morgan continues to signal interest, floats plans, maybe forms or seeds a committee or keeps “exploring,” but explicitly says he’ll decide later in 2025; or he goes quiet and no formal candidacy statement is issued before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Within June, Morgan releases a video or holds a press event stating he is running for governor, possibly timed to end-of-Q2 fundraising optics, accompanied by filing organizational paperwork and initial staff hires being reported.",
    "rationale": "Context: A May 15 Politico piece says Morgan laid out a blueprint for a possible run, implying he’s seriously considering it. Today is June 6, leaving just over three weeks. Historically, Morgan has flirted with runs and then passed (e.g., 2018), so the base rate for him personally is to hold off. As a wealthy potential self-funder, he faces less pressure to announce early; he can enter later without months of small-dollar ramp. Florida’s 2026 cycle doesn’t require an announcement this early, and without strong signals of an imminent event (scheduled launch, senior hires leaked, committee branding, media embargo alerts), the status quo favors no announcement by July 1. Countervailing reasons for a June announcement exist: quarter-end optics (June 30), desire to freeze the Democratic field, capitalize on recent media attention, and early messaging on popular issues (abortion, marijuana, insurance). That keeps the probability above very low levels. Why not higher: limited time; lack of concrete pre-launch indicators; Morgan’s history of public deliberation without declaring. Why not lower: the Politico reporting suggests genuine planning; he can move quickly; a surprise end-of-quarter launch is plausible. What would move me up: credible reporting of a scheduled announcement; formation/branding of a Florida candidate/PC that’s paired with public language of “I’m running”; key staff signings leaked; media advisories for a mid/late June event. What would move me down: Morgan publicly stating he’ll decide after summer; endorsing someone else; reporting that he’s ruled out a 2026 bid. The research assistant provided no additional info, so this relies on public context, timing, and Morgan’s track record. Weighting the status quo appropriately, I see a modest but real chance of a June launch.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill John Morgan announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [John Morgan lays out campaign blueprint for possible Florida governor run](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/15/john-morgan-florida-governor-run-00351005)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if John Morgan announces his candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
