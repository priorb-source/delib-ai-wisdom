    "review": "Forecaster 2’s analysis hinges on facts I don’t find credible: there is no reliable evidence that Ekrem İmamoğlu was arrested by May 7, nor that recent protests reached “hundreds of thousands” or produced ~1,900 detentions. Those claims materially inflate momentum and lead to an overconfident 88%. Their point about the Global Protest Tracker’s curation and potential lag is valid, though.\n\nForecaster 3 is more grounded. They correctly emphasize Turkey’s restrictive protest environment, the Tracker’s selectivity/lag, and the need for a clear catalyst. Their probability (28%), however, seems to underweight that a ≥10,000-person event already occurred on May 1 (authorized May Day marches ~65,000), which could plausibly be added to the Tracker, and that 55 days remain for another ≥10k event. Some specifics (e.g., exact inflation rate, a May 30 hearing as a decisive flashpoint) are less central or uncertain, but the direction of their reasoning is sound.\n\nNet: F2 overstates; F3 is cautious but perhaps too low given the May 1 pathway to Yes. Neither provides decisive new evidence that should move me substantially.",
    "rationale": "Two viable paths to Yes remain: (1) Carnegie adds a Türkiye entry for the May 1 Labor Day events and tags size as 10,000+; or (2) another ≥10,000 protest occurs and is added before July 1. The May 1 events clearly exceed the threshold (officially ~65,000 across authorized marches) and drew international coverage due to clashes and mass detentions, which raises inclusion odds. Countervailing factors are significant: the Tracker’s curation (they often skip routine annual May Day entries unless unusually salient), uncertain update cadence before July 1, and a crucial ambiguity about whether this question launched before May 1 (if not, that event doesn’t qualify). Additionally, Turkey’s security posture has repeatedly fragmented or preempted large gatherings, making new ≥10k events less likely absent a strong catalyst.\n\nI weighed the other forecasters’ arguments. F2’s high-confidence narrative rests on claims I regard as inaccurate, so I discount it. F3’s caution aligns with my concerns on curation and suppression, but seems to discount the existing May 1 route and the relatively low 10k threshold. Given these offsets and the unresolved launch-date caveat, I’m maintaining a mid-range stance slightly below even odds.\n\nNo change to my forecast: the balance between a clear qualifying event that might be listed and the meaningful curation/timing/eligibility risks still nets out around the mid-40s.",
