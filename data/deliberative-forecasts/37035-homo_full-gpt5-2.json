    "review": "Both forecasters align with my base-rate view: CDC very rarely issues Level 3 Travel Health Notices for yellow fever because vaccination substantially mitigates risk, and even larger historical outbreaks did not trigger Level 3. They add two useful emphases: (1) CDC just updated to a regional Level 2 in April 2025, making a rapid, country-specific escalation less likely within ~5–6 weeks; and (2) a Level 3 would require both a material epidemiological shift (e.g., sustained urban transmission) and a CDC action before June 1, which is a tight timeline. The mention of rainy season vector dynamics is a mild upside risk but not enough to outweigh precedent and current epidemiology. I find their reasoning sound and consistent with my prior view.",
    "rationale": "The question resolves Yes only if Colombia’s CDC Travel Health Notice exceeds Level 2 on/after June 1, 2025. As of late April, the notice is Level 2 for yellow fever. Base rates strongly favor No: CDC has historically kept yellow fever at Level 2, even during larger outbreaks, because vaccination mitigates traveler risk. Current data indicate primarily rural/sylvatic transmission with no verified urban chains in major cities; Colombia is conducting mass vaccination and imposing proof-of-vaccination for high-risk areas. The CDC’s recent April 2025 regional Level 2 update further suggests policy inertia over the short horizon. A Yes outcome would likely require confirmed sustained urban transmission in a major city, evidence that travelers cannot reasonably access vaccine (supply/access crisis), or significant exported traveler cases prompting rapid CDC escalation. None are presently observed. The additional constraint that Metaculus checks on/after June 1 slightly lowers the chance (a brief pre–June 1 spike that’s reversed would still resolve No). Given peers’ arguments and the fresh CDC update, I make a small downward adjustment from 8% to 7%.",
