    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my base case (slight lean No). New/useful additions: (1) explicit emphasis that ties (50.8) resolve No, which effectively nudges the barrier slightly higher; (2) the reminder that preliminary U-Mich prints can swing 1–3 points on sampling variance alone, making a narrow Yes plausible even without improved fundamentals; (3) a nod to seasonal gasoline price pressure into early summer as a headwind. I find their weighting sensible: the breadth of weakness and the spike in inflation expectations argue persistence; the extreme low favors some mean reversion. Forecaster 2 is a bit closer to 50-50 due to mean reversion; Forecaster 3 hews nearer my prior due to momentum and policy uncertainty. I’m persuaded to shade slightly higher than my prior to reflect the short-term volatility/mean-reversion point, but I still lean No given sticky inflation expectations and ongoing policy/trade uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "Set-up: April prelim at 50.8 amid four consecutive declines, multi-decade-high inflation expectations, rising unemployment expectations, and policy/trade uncertainty. The May question resolves on the prelim if necessary, and a tie at 50.8 is No. \n\nDrivers into May: \n- Negatives: Persistent tariff/price headlines and elevated inflation expectations tend to depress the index and are sticky month to month. Labor concerns have been building, and equity/market volatility can weigh on sentiment. These support a flat-to-lower reading.\n- Positives: The index is at an extreme low, where mean reversion and noise are common. With typical monthly noise of roughly 1–3 points, a marginal uptick above 50.8 is plausible even without a clear macro improvement. Any stabilization in markets, gas prices, or rhetoric could tip it higher.\n\nBalance: I continue to view ≤50.8 as the base case due to breadth and persistence of the negatives, plus the tie-breaking rule favoring No. However, I modestly increase the probability of a Yes outcome to reflect the credible chance that sampling variance/mean reversion alone can push May slightly above 50.8.",
