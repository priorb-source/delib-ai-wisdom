  "information": "The authority to revoke a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status rests with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), not the President. According to legal precedent, revocation typically requires evidence that an organization is violating public policy or engaging in illegal activities. The key Supreme Court case, Bob Jones University v. United States (1983), affirmed that tax-exempt status could be revoked for organizations violating clear public policy, such as racial discrimination. The legal and administrative process in the Bob Jones case took over seven years to resolve. Historically, no major university has had its tax-exempt status revoked in recent decades.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 66 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The IRS does not take formal revocation action before July 1. There may be political pressure, rhetoric, or even preliminary inquiries, but no credible reporting that Harvard’s 501(c)(3) status has been revoked by the IRS appears by the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An extraordinary, accelerated action occurs: the IRS issues and publicly communicates a revocation of Harvard’s 501(c)(3) status (or Congress enacts binding legislation that forces the IRS to remove it) and major outlets credibly report the loss before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Authority and process: Only the IRS can revoke a 501(c)(3) determination. Revocation typically follows an examination, notice, an opportunity to respond/appeal, and creation of an administrative record. That process is measured in months to years, not weeks. The key precedent, Bob Jones University v. United States (1983), shows revocation can occur for violating clear public policy, but that episode took years to resolve and rested on egregious facts (racial discrimination). The research assistant’s summary aligns with this: IRS, not the President, controls revocations; the process is slow; and no comparable major university has had its exemption revoked in recent decades.\n- Timeline constraint: With ~66 days left, completing a legally durable revocation for an institution as large and prominent as Harvard is highly improbable. Even an aggressive administration would face procedural and litigation risks; a rushed, unilateral IRS action would almost certainly trigger immediate court challenges and internal checks.\n- Congressional path: Congress could, in theory, change the law to strip or condition exemptions. But passing such legislation specifically targeting Harvard would face legal hurdles (e.g., bill of attainder concerns) and practical ones (committee process, floor time, potential filibuster or narrow margins). Doing so before July 1 is very unlikely.\n- Why not zero: The President’s public threats marginally raise tail risk. A highly unusual, rapid IRS action or a fast-tracked legislative move could, in principle, produce a revocation and credible reporting before the deadline. That remains a remote tail.\n- Why not higher: Institutional inertia, legal safeguards, due process requirements, and lack of clear, well-documented violations that would justify immediate revocation keep the odds very low. The historical base rate for revoking a top university’s 501(c)(3) is near zero, and time remaining is short.\n- What would raise my forecast: Credible reporting that the IRS has opened a formal examination of Harvard with a notice of proposed revocation; leaked or public IRS/Chief Counsel memos outlining statutory grounds; an announced revocation timetable; or rapid, viable congressional movement (e.g., a passed bill in one chamber with clear path in the other) to strip large universities’ exemptions.\n- What would lower it further: Public statements from the IRS Commissioner ruling out expedited action; lack of any movement by mid-June; or credible reporting that any related congressional effort has stalled.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
