    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides crucial new information I lacked: a draft constitution completing public consultation in mid-April 2025, laws banning central government agencies, and explicit independence threats from Dodik and Stevanović. This represents substantial concrete preparation beyond the symbolic parade I noted. Forecaster 3 emphasizes the important historical pattern of RS using referendum threats as brinkmanship rather than following through, plus strong U.S. and EU deterrence. Both forecasters make a key observation I should have emphasized more: despite extensive preparation, no date has been announced yet, even though they've had opportunity to do so. This gap between preparation and announcement is telling. Forecaster 2's higher forecast (30%) reflects the concrete steps taken, while Forecaster 3's 18% aligns with mine and emphasizes status quo bias. The draft constitution and legislative actions are more significant than I initially weighted, but the failure to announce despite being prepared suggests either (1) they're waiting for a trigger event, (2) using it as leverage, or (3) facing sufficient deterrence to hesitate.",
    "rationale": "The new information about the draft constitution and laws represents a meaningful update - these are institutional preparations that go well beyond rhetoric. This should increase my probability estimate. However, several factors still favor a No outcome: (1) The historical pattern of RS making threats without following through on referendum announcements; (2) Despite having completed preparations, they haven't announced a date, suggesting hesitation or strategic delay; (3) Strong international deterrence with explicit warnings from the U.S. and EU; (4) Only 60 days remain, and if announcement were truly imminent, we might expect clearer signals or timeline statements. The question's low bar (only requiring announcement, not the referendum itself) partially offsets these concerns. Balancing the concrete preparations against the lack of actual announcement despite having had time, I'm updating upward from my initial 18% to account for the more extensive groundwork than I realized, but not to Forecaster 2's 30% level because the deterrence factors and historical brinkmanship pattern remain compelling.",
