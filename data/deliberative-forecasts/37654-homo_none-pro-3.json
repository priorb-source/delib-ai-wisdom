    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of this question: the task of breaking up a major federal agency is monumental, and the timeline before July 1, 2025, is exceptionally short. Both peers correctly identify the immense legislative, legal, and bureaucratic hurdles, as well as the powerful force of institutional inertia. Forecaster 2 adds a valuable point that the maintainers of the tracker spreadsheet are unlikely to have a low bar for what constitutes 'complete,' and a symbolic executive order immediately blocked by the courts would probably not suffice. I find this convincing. Forecaster 3's analysis is similar but arrives at a higher probability of 5%, justified by the possibility of a 'political blitz.' However, I find this reasoning less persuasive, primarily because Forecaster 3 also correctly notes that only about six weeks remain until the deadline. A political blitz of this magnitude would require significant groundwork that, according to our available information, has not occurred. The short remaining time makes such a scenario less, not more, likely.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast. The deliberation has reinforced my initial assessment that a 'Yes' outcome is extremely improbable. The most critical factor, highlighted by Forecaster 3's timeline observation, is that we are now on May 15, 2025, leaving only about six weeks until the resolution date. The probability of navigating the complex legislative and administrative processes required to dismantle NOAA in this timeframe is vanishingly small. Furthermore, Forecaster 2’s point about the resolution source is key; the subreddit community maintaining the tracker is likely savvy enough to distinguish between a substantive, completed action and a mere statement of intent or a legally challenged executive order. Thus, the bar for being marked 'complete' is likely high. My initial 2% estimate was based on the roughly five-month period following an inauguration; with the majority of that time having passed with no apparent major progress, the probability has necessarily decreased. I am therefore updating my forecast from 2% to 1% to reflect the extremely compressed remaining timeline and the high standard of evidence likely required for resolution.",
