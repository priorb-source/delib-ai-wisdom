    "review": "Forecaster 2 presents compelling evidence I hadn't fully weighted: Q1 2025 reports from Halliburton and Baker Hughes showing declining activity are strong leading indicators. Their 75% forecast reflects confidence that the current weakness will persist through May 30. However, they may be overweighting longer-term trends versus short-term volatility.\n\nForecaster 3 provides valuable context about WTI prices ($64-65/bbl near breakeven) and Dallas Fed survey data showing cost pressures from steel tariffs. However, their analysis contains a critical error: they reference a baseline \"near ~600\" when the most recent data shows 585. This 15-rig discrepancy undermines their 35% forecast, which assumes we need a significant decline from around 600. We're actually only 2 rigs above the threshold already.\n\nBoth forecasters raised important points about cost pressures and service company weakness that strengthen the case for continued declines. However, Forecaster 3's baseline error is significant, and Forecaster 2 may be too confident given the recent +2 weekly increase showing some stability.",
    "rationale": "Upon reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast moderately upward toward Yes. Key factors:\n\n1. **Extreme proximity**: At 585, we're only 2 rigs above 583. Forecaster 3's error in assuming ~600 baseline actually strengthens the Yes case considerably.\n\n2. **Leading indicators**: Forecaster 2's point about Q1 service company reports showing declining activity is strong evidence I underweighted. This suggests underlying weakness that could manifest in continued rig count declines.\n\n3. **Cost pressures**: Steel tariffs and rising costs (from Forecaster 3's Dallas Fed survey) add meaningful downside pressure on drilling activity.\n\n4. **Time horizon**: With 5-6 weeks remaining, we only need one or two moderately negative weeks to drop below 583. The recent week-over-week volatility (-7 followed by +2) shows moves of this magnitude occur regularly.\n\n5. **Counterbalancing factors**: The recent +2 increase and general short-term stickiness of drilling programs prevent me from going as high as Forecaster 2's 75%.\n\nGiven we're essentially at the threshold already, normal volatility combined with underlying weakness tips the balance slightly toward Yes, but not overwhelmingly so.",
