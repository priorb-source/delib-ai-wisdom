  "information": "The final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index for May 2025 was 52.2, an improvement from the preliminary reading of 50.8, but a decline from 57.0 in March and 64.7 in February. The index has fallen nearly 30% since January 2025. Within the May report, the Current Economic Conditions Index decreased to 58.9 points from 59.8 in April, while the Economic Expectations Index increased to 47.9 points from 47.3. In a separate survey, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 98 in May from a revised 85.7 in the prior month. Other economic indicators showed soft growth signals, with the ISM services index at 49.9 and the manufacturing index at 48.5.\n\nInflation expectations remain a significant concern for consumers. The May University of Michigan survey showed consumer expectations for inflation over the next year increased to 7.3% from 6.5% in April, while long-term inflation expectations rose to 4.6% from 4.4%. Trade policy is also a major factor; according to the survey's director, Joanne Hsu, nearly three-quarters of consumers mentioned tariffs and trade policies as a source of uncertainty. Recent policy actions include the doubling of US steel tariffs. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller has outlined a potential path to interest rate cuts later in the year but noted this depends on how trade negotiations unfold and on progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation goal.\n\nAmerican consumers are exhibiting cautious behavior. Personal spending rose by only 0.2% in the last reported month, while the savings rate surged to 4.9% in March, the highest level in almost a year. Consumers are reportedly focusing more on essential goods and services. This caution is reflected in the performance of discount retailers like Dollar General, which recently hiked its sales forecast. Household finances are also under pressure from debt; following the end of the pandemic-era payment pause, student loan delinquencies jumped to 7.74% from 1%.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 23 days. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report for June 2025 is expected to be published on the final Friday of June 2025, which is June 27, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the index staying below 54.0. The May 2025 final reading was 52.2, which is already below the 54.0 threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The June reading reaches or exceeds 54.0, requiring an increase of at least 1.8 points from May's 52.2. This could occur if trade policy tensions ease significantly, inflation expectations moderate, the Federal Reserve provides clearer guidance on interest rate cuts, or positive economic data surprises to the upside. The preliminary reading or positive Conference Board data could signal improving sentiment.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The June reading remains below 54.0. This occurs if the index stays near its current 52.2 level or declines further. Given the persistent concerns about tariffs affecting three-quarters of consumers, elevated inflation expectations at 7.3% for the next year, weak economic indicators with both ISM indices below 50, and consumer caution reflected in minimal spending growth, sentiment remains depressed through June.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome since the May 2025 final reading of 52.2 is already 1.8 points below the 54.0 threshold. The index has exhibited sharp downward momentum, falling nearly 30% since January 2025, from 64.7 in February to 57.0 in March to 52.2 in May. Multiple structural headwinds persist: inflation expectations remain elevated at 7.3% for the coming year and 4.6% for the long term, nearly three-quarters of consumers cite tariff and trade policy uncertainty, economic activity indicators are weak with ISM services at 49.9 and manufacturing at 48.5, and consumer behavior shows extreme caution with spending up only 0.2% and savings rates at 4.9%. With only 23 days until the June final report, there is limited time for positive policy developments or economic data to meaningfully shift sentiment upward by the required 1.8+ points. Some countervailing factors exist: the May final reading improved from its preliminary level of 50.8, the Conference Board confidence index rose sharply to 98 from 85.7, and the Economic Expectations component showed slight improvement. However, these factors must overcome both the strong downward trend and the persistent structural concerns. I would increase my probability estimate toward No if major trade agreements are announced, the Fed signals imminent rate cuts, or inflation expectations drop substantially. I would increase confidence in Yes if trade tensions escalate, inflation expectations rise further, or economic data weakens. Given the strong status quo bias favoring Yes, the momentum of decline, and limited time for reversal, I estimate a 72% probability of the June reading remaining below 54.0.",
