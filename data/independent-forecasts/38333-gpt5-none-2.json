    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (until July 1, 2025)",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "Suarez continues to “weigh” the race, builds a political committee and donor network, does private outreach, and delays a formal declaration until later in 2025 or early 2026.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He schedules a mid-to-late June rollout to capture end-of-Q2 fundraising momentum and media attention, perhaps timed to a GOP event, and formally announces before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Context and timing: We’re ~17 months from the Nov 2026 general election. For recent Florida gubernatorial cycles, credible candidates often announce 12–18 months out, so a mid-2025 announcement is plausible. However, there are only ~26 days left in this window, and there has not yet been a formal announcement.\n- Evidence/signals: Axios (May 2) reported Suarez is weighing a bid, which is a weak-to-moderate signal of intent but far short of imminent action. Since then (per the assistant’s report), we have no additional public signals like staff hires, paperwork filings, a launch tour teased, or major donor summits—indicators that typically precede an announcement within weeks. The research assistant had no additional information, which itself is a mild negative signal for an announcement being imminent.\n- Incentives cutting both ways:\n  • Reasons for Yes: Announcing before June 30 could leverage end-of-quarter fundraising deadlines and get a head start on field/capacity building. The 2026 field is opening, and early positioning can help lock in donors and media oxygen.\n  • Reasons for No: Florida allows robust pre-campaign fundraising via political committees, reducing the need for an early formal announcement. Suarez may want to assess rivals, polling, and donor commitments through the summer. Absent strong pre-launch smoke (staff hires, venue holds), late-2025 timing looks more likely.\n- Status quo weight: With limited time and no strong near-term launch signals, the base case is that no announcement occurs before July 1. I overweight this because changes of this kind (formal declarations) usually leave a public trail beforehand.\n- Why not higher? If a launch were imminent in the next few weeks, we’d usually see leaks about staffing, domain registrations, donor calls, or a scheduled event. The lack of such tells keeps the probability restrained.\n- Why not lower? The Axios report and the strategic appeal of a pre–Q2-end announcement mean a non-trivial chance remains. Also, gubernatorial cycles often see first movers around this timeframe.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of staff hires, filing paperwork for a campaign or committee with clear gubernatorial branding, scheduled statewide tour or launch event in June, or major donors signaling a launch.\n- What would move me down: Reporting that Suarez will delay, that he’s focusing on other roles, or that a heavyweight Republican announces soon and Suarez signals he’ll wait or pass.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Francis Suarez announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Miami mayor weighs gubernatorial bid](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/02/florida-governor-miami-mayor-francis-suarez)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Francis Suarez announces his candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
