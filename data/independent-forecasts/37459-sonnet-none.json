    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 8 days. 13F filings are due 45 days after quarter end (March 31, 2025), which means the filing deadline is around May 15, 2025. The filing could come earlier.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Berkshire Hathaway's recent 13F filings show no holdings in Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla. The company maintains positions in Apple and Amazon as its only Magnificent 7 holdings.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway's Q1 2025 13F filing shows the company maintained its existing strategy of avoiding most Magnificent 7 tech stocks beyond Apple and Amazon. No new positions in Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla appear in the filing, consistent with Warren Buffett's historical investment philosophy and skepticism toward businesses he views as outside his circle of competence.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire reveals a new position in one of the five excluded Magnificent 7 stocks, most plausibly Alphabet or Microsoft given their strong cash flows and market dominance. This could reflect a decision by portfolio managers Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who have some autonomy for smaller positions, or a rare philosophical shift by Warren Buffett toward embracing dominant tech platforms.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Warren Buffett has consistently avoided Nvidia (semiconductors/AI), Meta (social media), Tesla (electric vehicles with high valuation), and even Microsoft and Alphabet despite their strong fundamentals. At 94, Buffett is unlikely to dramatically shift his investment philosophy. The research assistant found no information suggesting new purchases, which is significant—major positions in these high-profile stocks would likely generate market rumors or news coverage before the filing. The fact that any purchase decision was already made in Q1 2025 (January-March) means information would have had time to leak if it were substantial. The probability is not zero because: (1) smaller positions managed by Combs or Weschler could fly under the radar, (2) Berkshire has evolved its tech holdings over time (adding Apple and Amazon), and (3) companies like Alphabet or Microsoft could theoretically fit value criteria with their cash flows and market dominance. However, the base rate of Berkshire adding new Magnificent 7 positions is extremely low, and no evidence suggests a departure from this pattern. For my forecast to move higher, I would need: news reports or credible rumors of purchases, evidence of philosophical shift in recent Buffett letters/interviews, or unusual trading activity in these stocks traceable to Berkshire. For it to move lower (closer to 0), I would need explicit recent statements from Buffett reaffirming avoidance of these particular stocks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of any Magnificent 7 stock other than Amazon and Apple in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nInvestopedia: [Berkshire Hathaway Doesn't Hold Nvidia Stock—Will Warren Buffett Come to Regret it?](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffetts-secret-portfolio-dumping-shares-3-supercharged-artificial-intelligence-ai)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding shares of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
