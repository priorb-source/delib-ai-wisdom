    "review": "Both forecasters raise critically important information I had not considered. Forecaster 3's mention of a successful confidence vote in mid-April 2025 is potentially game-changing - if accurate, this fundamentally alters the situation from an unresolved constitutional crisis to a stable government making a discretionary choice. This would explain why my 30% was too high. However, Forecaster 2 provides crucial context that tensions this narrative: President Vučić made statements as recently as May 14 (yesterday) about a decision coming 'within ten days,' suggesting the question of snap elections remains actively on the table despite any confidence vote. Forecaster 2 also highlights Serbia's remarkable pattern of frequent snap elections (2014, 2016, 2020, 2022, 2023) which I underweighted, and provides important legal timing information showing elections could feasibly be announced in late May or June for an August/September vote. The tension between these two narratives is key: either the mid-April confidence vote resolved the crisis and officials are simply posturing, or the election question remains genuinely open despite government formation. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the president's repeated 'within ten days' framing, most recently yesterday, suggests this isn't merely theoretical - we're apparently at a real decision point right now.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I need to significantly revise my forecast downward. The mid-April confidence vote, if it occurred, removes the primary forcing mechanism for snap elections. The government has renewed legitimacy and the constitutional crisis is resolved. This shifts the question from 'will crisis force elections?' to 'will the government choose elections for tactical reasons?' - a much higher bar. The short 47-day window now works even more strongly against a Yes outcome, as any slippage in decision-making quickly exhausts the timeline. However, I cannot go as low as 10% because: (1) The president's May 14 statement about a decision 'within ten days' indicates this remains under active consideration right now, not merely theoretical, (2) Serbia's documented pattern of snap elections every 1-3 years shows a political culture comfortable with frequent electoral resets, (3) A summer election could offer tactical advantages the ruling party might find attractive, (4) The May 14 timing means we should know within the next 10 days whether an announcement is coming. The key insight is that we're past the crisis phase and into the tactical calculation phase. Given a stable government just formed but active presidential signaling about an imminent decision, I estimate 20% - accounting for the resolution of the immediate crisis while recognizing that the question remains genuinely open in the very near term.",
