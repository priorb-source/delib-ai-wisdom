  "information": "On May 2, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to stop all federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS). The order directs the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) Board of Directors and all executive departments and agencies to cease federal financial support. The order requires the CPB Board to ensure its licensees and permittees do not use Federal funds for NPR and PBS. The White House stated the action was taken because the networks allegedly spread 'radical propaganda.' As of May 16, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker still listed the objective as 'in progress.'\n\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has filed a lawsuit challenging the executive order, asserting that it is a private nonprofit corporation independent of federal executive control and not subject to the President's authority. The CPB's funding is allocated by Congress two years in advance; it has received $535 million for the current fiscal year, which provides funding through September 30, 2027. Following the executive order, the CPB notified affiliated stations that funding could be halted but simultaneously announced its legal challenge.\n\nThe executive action has prompted debate in Congress. Some Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have expressed support for public media, citing the importance of local programming and emergency alerts in rural communities. Federal funding is considered crucial for many local stations, with some receiving up to 25% of their annual revenues from the federal government. According to their respective CEOs, about 15% of the public network's budget comes from public funds for PBS, while NPR receives less than 5% of its budget from the CPB.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the objective remains marked as 'in progress' and is not marked as complete by the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Project 2025 Tracker maintainers continue to classify the objective as 'in progress' through July 1, 2025. Despite the executive order, actual federal funding to NPR and PBS continues due to the ongoing legal challenge and pre-appropriated funds through 2027. The maintainers wait for concrete evidence that funding has actually ceased or for the legal dispute to be resolved before marking it complete.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Keep_Track community maintainers decide that the executive order signed on May 2 is sufficient to mark the objective as complete, regardless of implementation or legal challenges. Alternatively, the lawsuit is quickly resolved in favor of the administration, funding is actually halted, or Congress passes legislation that definitively ends the funding, prompting the maintainers to update the status to complete before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The key insight is that this question depends not on whether NPR/PBS funding is actually stopped, but on when the Keep_Track subreddit maintainers decide to mark the objective as 'complete' in their tracker. As of May 16, they have kept it marked as 'in progress' despite the executive order being signed two weeks earlier on May 2. This suggests they are waiting for something more concrete than just the signing of an executive order.\n\nSeveral factors suggest the status quo (remaining 'in progress') is most likely: (1) The CPB has pre-appropriated funding through September 2027 and actual funding has not stopped; (2) An active legal challenge is ongoing with the CPB asserting it is independent of executive control; (3) Congressional debate continues with some Republican senators expressing support for public media; (4) Only 6 weeks remain until July 1, which may be insufficient time for legal resolution or actual cessation of funding.\n\nThe fact that the maintainers haven't marked it complete yet is significant evidence. If they considered the executive order alone sufficient, they likely would have updated it already. This suggests they're applying a higher bar - perhaps requiring actual cessation of funding or resolution of legal challenges.\n\nFor my forecast to be higher, I would need evidence that: the Keep_Track maintainers use a loose definition of 'complete' based on executive actions rather than implementation, the lawsuit is resolved quickly in the administration's favor, or funding actually stops in the next 6 weeks. For my forecast to be lower, I would need evidence that the maintainers explicitly require full implementation and resolution of legal challenges before marking objectives complete.\n\nGiven the information, I estimate a 25% probability. The main path to 'Yes' is if maintainers decide the executive order is sufficient, but their delay in marking it complete suggests this is unlikely. The time constraint and ongoing legal/funding complications make actual implementation before July 1 improbable.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"stop funding for NPR and PBS\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 2, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order to stop all federal funding for National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
