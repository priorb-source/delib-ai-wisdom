    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "14 days - the Democratic primary is scheduled for June 17, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Uncertain outcome with limited information available about the race dynamics just two weeks before the primary",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Jay Jones loses the Democratic primary to another candidate who has stronger name recognition, better fundraising, more substantial party establishment support, or superior campaign organization in the final weeks",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Jay Jones successfully capitalizes on his campaign momentum from ramping up his bid last November, leverages his experience as a former delegate from Norfolk, and wins plurality or majority support in the Democratic primary",
    "rationale": "With only 14 days until the June 17 primary, the race dynamics are largely set, but I face significant information limitations. The Washington Post article from November 2024 confirms Jones is a serious candidate who was actively ramping up his campaign, and his background as a former delegate provides relevant political experience. However, critical information is absent: I don't know who else is running, current polling numbers, endorsement patterns, fundraising totals, or recent campaign developments. In Virginia Democratic primaries for statewide office, multiple candidates typically compete. Without information distinguishing Jones as either a clear frontrunner or underdog, I must assign moderate uncertainty. The status quo principle suggests being cautious about predicting significant events without strong evidence. If this were a 2-3 candidate race with Jones having momentum, the probability could be 40-50%. If there were 4-5 strong candidates with no clear leader, it might be 15-25%. Given the complete lack of comparative information about the field and race dynamics, I'm estimating around 30% - reflecting genuine uncertainty while acknowledging Jones is at least a credible candidate. My forecast would increase with polling showing Jones leading, fewer serious opponents, or strong endorsements. It would decrease with evidence of multiple strong candidates, poor polling, or campaign struggles.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
