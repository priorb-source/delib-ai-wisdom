    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Russia continues military operations in Ukraine but does not invade another country, and the US does not accuse Russia of any new invasion",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia maintains its current military focus on Ukraine without sending ground forces into any other country without consent. Even if there are tensions with neighbors like Moldova, Georgia, or Baltic states, Russia either does not take military action or any actions fall short of what the US would characterize as an invasion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Russia sends ground military forces into another country such as Moldova (possibly related to Transnistria tensions), expands operations in Georgia beyond existing occupied territories, or takes action in another neighboring state, and the US government publicly accuses Russia of invasion. This could occur due to escalating regional tensions, Russian perception of strategic opportunity, or miscalculation.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires two conditions: Russia must invade another country AND the US must publicly accuse them. The extremely short timeframe of only 2 months is the most significant limiting factor. Russia's military remains heavily committed to Ukraine, and opening another front would require substantial planning, force repositioning, and would risk major escalation with NATO and the international community. The most plausible scenario would involve Moldova/Transnistria given existing Russian presence and recent historical tensions, but even this remains unlikely in such a short window. Base rates strongly favor the status quo - countries rarely invade others in any given 2-month period, and Russia expanding military operations beyond Ukraine would be extraordinary. My forecast is not higher because: the timeframe is very constrained, Russia's military is stretched, and there are no obvious indicators of imminent invasion that I'm aware of (though my information ends April 2024). My forecast is not lower because: I cannot rule out scenarios involving Moldova or Georgia escalation, Russia has demonstrated willingness for military intervention historically, and I lack the most recent year of intelligence that might reveal concerning developments. For me to update higher, I would need evidence of: significant Russian troop movements near non-Ukraine borders, major diplomatic crises with neighbors, or credible intelligence suggesting invasion planning. For me to update lower, I would need confirmation of continued sole focus on Ukraine with no concerning border activities.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the United States accuse Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News [Ukraine war: Which countries could Putin go for next? Is Europe vulnerable to a nuclear-armed bully? Your questions answered](https://news.sky.com/story/ukraine-war-which-countries-could-putin-go-for-next-is-europe-vulnerable-to-a-nuclear-armed-bully-your-questions-answered-13317497)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine, by Russia sending its ground military forces into that country without consent from the government of the country.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
