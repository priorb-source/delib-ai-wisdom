    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks, until July 1, 2025.",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beto O'Rourke continues to publicly consider a run but does not make a formal announcement by the July 1, 2025 deadline, choosing to delay his decision until later in the year or ultimately deciding against running.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Responding to perceived momentum, donor pressure, or a favorable political opening, Beto O'Rourke makes a formal announcement of his candidacy for the US Senate via a press conference, social media video, or FEC filing before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of a low probability is primarily driven by the short timeline. The resolution date is just over one month away. Typically, a high-profile campaign launch is preceded by weeks of credible leaks, reports of senior staff hires, and a clear 'pre-campaign' schedule; there are no strong public signals of this activity currently. The status quo is that O'Rourke is not a candidate. While the provided article shows he is openly considering a run, this is common for potential candidates testing the waters. The transition from 'considering' to a formal campaign launch is a significant step that is unlikely to occur so quickly without more groundwork becoming visible. Furthermore, after three consecutive high-profile losses, O'Rourke has an incentive to be highly strategic about his timing, potentially favoring a later launch in late 2025 to maximize impact and shorten the period he is a declared target. The probability is not lower because O'Rourke remains one of the most prominent Democrats in Texas, and he has explicitly kept the door open to a run. An early, surprise announcement is not impossible. My forecast would increase significantly with any concrete reports of campaign infrastructure being established (e.g., senior staff hired). Conversely, my forecast would decrease if another prominent Democrat, such as Colin Allred, were to announce their candidacy for the same seat.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beto O'Rourke announce his candidacy for US Senator from Texas before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFort Worth Star-Telegram: [Beto O’Rourke says ‘if’ Texans want him to run for U.S. Senate, ‘yes I will'](https://www.star-telegram.com/opinion/bud-kennedy)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Beto O'Rourke announces his candidacy for US Senator from Texas before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
