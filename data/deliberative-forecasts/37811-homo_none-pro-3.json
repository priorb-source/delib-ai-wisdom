    "review": "The other forecasters provided two compelling arguments that I had not sufficiently weighted. Forecaster 2 made the excellent point that a hypothetical new administration hostile to climate science would have already been in office for four months. If taking down Climate.gov were a high-priority action, it likely would have occurred already. The window for easy symbolic victories has likely passed. Forecaster 3 provided strong historical precedent from the 2017-2021 Trump administration, where the observed strategy was to alter or bury climate information, not to take down entire high-profile domains like Climate.gov. I find both lines of reasoning highly convincing as they provide specific, evidence-based constraints on the primary risk scenario I had identified.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upwards from 95% to 98%. My initial forecast was anchored on the principle of institutional inertia, but I allocated 5% to political risk. The arguments from the other forecasters have convinced me this allocation was too high. Forecaster 2's point that a new administration has had four months to act and has not, combined with Forecaster 3's point that the historical precedent is modification rather than outright removal, significantly diminishes the probability of a politically motivated takedown within the short 41-day timeframe. The strength of the status quo is very high. I am increasing my confidence in a 'Yes' outcome because the most plausible failure path (a swift, politically motivated removal) now seems extremely unlikely given the time passed and historical precedent. The remaining 2% risk accounts for a low-probability 'black swan' event, such as a sudden and unexpected executive directive, a major targeted cyberattack, or a catastrophic technical failure.",
