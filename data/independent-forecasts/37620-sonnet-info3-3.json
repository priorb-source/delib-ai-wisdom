  "information": "Ramzan Kadyrov met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 7, 2025. Following the meeting, Kadyrov stated he received \"full understanding and support,\" and Russian state media reported that Putin praised the Chechen Republic's achievements. This is not the first time Kadyrov has publicly discussed stepping down; similar statements were made in 2016, 2020, and 2022, none of which resulted in his departure. The authority to appoint or dismiss the Head of the Chechen Republic rests exclusively with the President of Russia. Kadyrov has held the position since April 2007.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 3 weeks (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Kadyrov remains Head of the Chechen Republic",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Putin declines to accept Kadyrov's resignation or any succession process extends beyond June 1. This mirrors what occurred following similar statements in 2016, 2020, and 2022 where Kadyrov remained in his position despite public discussions of stepping down.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Putin accepts Kadyrov's resignation and swiftly appoints a successor before June 1, or Kadyrov is removed from office through dismissal, death, or incapacitation within the next 20 days.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors the status quo. Kadyrov has held this position for 18 years and has made virtually identical statements about stepping down at least three times before (2016, 2020, 2022) with zero follow-through. The recent May 7 meeting with Putin resulted in praise for Kadyrov's work and 'full understanding and support' - language that suggests continuity rather than transition. With only 20 days remaining until the resolution date, even if Putin wanted to facilitate a transition, the timeline is extremely compressed. Putin has strong strategic incentives to maintain Kadyrov in position given his effectiveness at managing a historically volatile region. The Russian political system moves slowly on major personnel decisions, especially for sensitive positions like Chechen leadership. My forecast is not higher because there is always residual uncertainty around health emergencies, sudden political shifts, or unforeseen circumstances. My forecast is not lower because Kadyrov did make these statements publicly, which creates some non-zero probability of action. To update higher, I would need: credible reports of Putin accepting the resignation, naming of a successor, or evidence of Kadyrov's serious health issues. To update lower, I would need: explicit retraction of the resignation statements or additional Putin endorsements of Kadyrov continuing in his role.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ramzan Kadyrov cease to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Moscow Times: [Kadyrov Says He Wants to Step Down as Chechen Leader](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/06/kadyrov-says-he-wants-to-step-down-as-chechen-leader-a88991)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
