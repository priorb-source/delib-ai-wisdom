    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling arguments that have caused me to revise my initial assessment. I started at 25%, weighing the urgency of a snap election heavily. Forecaster 2 (15%) correctly emphasizes that the phrase 'growing support' in the source article signals a very early stage of discussion, and that the complete absence of any pre-campaign activity is a strong negative signal. Forecaster 3 (21%) introduces the most critical piece of evidence I had overlooked: the 2017 precedent where Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn explicitly declined to run in a snap election to maintain state neutrality. This is a powerful historical parallel that establishes a strong political norm against Han running while in his current role. Forecaster 3's characterization of Han as a technocrat, rather than a natural campaigner, further reinforces the idea that he would be reluctant to enter a hurried, high-stakes race. The combination of these arguments, particularly the historical precedent, is highly convincing.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 25% to 20%. The primary reason for this revision is the new argument, raised by Forecaster 3, concerning the 2017 precedent of Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn. This precedent establishes a powerful norm that an acting head of state should remain neutral and not enter a presidential race, a factor I had not sufficiently weighted. This historical context significantly increases the political barrier for Han to declare his candidacy. Furthermore, I find Forecaster 2's point about the lack of any visible campaign preparations to be a strong piece of negative evidence. In a compressed timeline, we would expect to see *some* signs of activity if an announcement were imminent, and their absence is telling.\n\nWhile I am lowering my forecast, I am not going as low as 15% because the core driver for a 'Yes' outcome—a ruling party in crisis needing a consensus candidate for a snap election—remains a potent, if unpredictable, force. The pressure to draft a well-known, stabilizing figure could still plausibly override established norms. My updated forecast of 20% reflects a recalibration, giving much greater weight to the normative and logistical barriers to a candidacy announcement, while still acknowledging the non-trivial chance created by the extraordinary political circumstances.",
