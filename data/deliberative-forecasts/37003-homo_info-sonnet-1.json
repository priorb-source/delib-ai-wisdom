    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides crucial specific polling data (SPÖ 38-40% vs FPÖ 21-24%) which I lacked, but appears to have a critical timeline error - claiming only 6 days remain when the election is likely in October (~6 months away, consistent with Forecaster 3's March polling reference and typical Vienna election cycles). This dramatically changes the interpretation: a 16-19 point lead is near-decisive with 6 days left, but leaves substantial room for movement over 6 months. Forecaster 3's more cautious 72% properly accounts for the longer timeframe and potential for national FPÖ momentum to affect Vienna. The polling data showing SPÖ at 38-40% is actually slightly below their 2020 result (41.6%), suggesting some erosion rather than strengthening. However, both forecasters confirm the overwhelming 80-year historical precedent, which remains the dominant factor.",
    "rationale": "Synthesizing all information: The 80-year base rate of SPÖ victories in Vienna remains extraordinarily powerful and is the anchor for any forecast. The new polling information showing SPÖ with a commanding ~17 point lead is encouraging, but three factors prevent updating as high as Forecaster 2's 93%: (1) approximately 6 months remain until the election, not 6 days - sufficient time for significant movement; (2) SPÖ's current 38-40% support represents a modest decline from their 2020 performance (41.6%), indicating some vulnerability; (3) FPÖ emerging as the main challenger at 21-24% aligns with national trends that could continue strengthening. However, breaking an 80-year pattern requires extraordinary circumstances for which I see no clear evidence. Even with some erosion, SPÖ maintains structural advantages (organization, incumbency, Vienna's left-leaning urban electorate). The specific polling data does provide more confidence than I had initially, warranting a modest upward revision. My updated forecast of 85% reflects: strong confidence from historical precedent and current polling lead, tempered by the 6-month timeframe and evidence of gradual SPÖ decline.",
