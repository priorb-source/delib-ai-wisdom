  "information": "On May 8, 2025, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it would no longer be updating its Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database. The official reason cited was 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes'. The database, active since 1980, had logged 403 events with an estimated cost exceeding $2.9 trillion. The discontinuation has been attributed to agency restructuring, budget cuts, and staff departures, including the lead scientist for the program. The administration also proposed a 25% reduction in NOAA's budget for fiscal year 2026.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The objective is currently marked 'in progress' in the spreadsheet. If this status does not change, the question will resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite significant actions taken to weaken NOAA, such as steep budget cuts and the cancellation of key programs, the moderators of the Project 2025 Tracker do not consider the agency's 'break up' to be complete. They view the process as ongoing and await a more formal legislative or executive action to dissolve the agency, which does not occur before the July 1 deadline. The status remains 'in progress'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The moderators of the Project 2025 Tracker interpret the recent actions—specifically the discontinuation of the Billion Dollar Disasters database and a proposed 25% budget cut—as fulfilling the objective of breaking up NOAA. They reason that functionally dismantling the agency is equivalent to a formal breakup and change the objective's status to 'complete' before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high bar for an objective to be marked 'complete' versus the short timeframe remaining until the resolution date. The status quo is a 'No' outcome, as the objective is currently 'in progress'. The world of government bureaucracy changes slowly, and breaking up a major federal agency is a monumental task. The information from my research assistant is the strongest evidence for a 'Yes' outcome. The discontinuation of a 40-year-old key climate database and a proposed 25% budget cut are extremely significant actions that functionally dismantle the agency. This could lead the tracker's moderators to mark the objective as complete. However, the term 'complete' typically implies finality, such as a formal legislative act or executive order dissolving the agency and reassigning its components. Such an act is highly unlikely to be finalized in the approximately six weeks before the July 1, 2025 deadline. The budget cut is also for the next fiscal year, meaning its full effect has not yet been realized. It is more probable that the tracker's moderators will view these actions as major steps in an ongoing process and leave the status as 'in progress'. My probability is not higher because of the high definitional bar for 'complete' and the power of institutional inertia. It is not lower because the reported actions are so severe that there is a non-trivial chance the moderators will consider the objective functionally achieved. I would increase my forecast if a specific bill to dissolve NOAA were passed or a sweeping executive order were signed. I would decrease it if the administration reversed its position or if the tracker's moderators clarified that a formal dissolution is required to mark the objective complete.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 8, 2025, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it would no longer be updating its Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database. The official reason cited was 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
