    "review": "- New arguments considered:\n  • Forecaster 2 highlights the 20M threshold as ~51% of CA population and flags a hypothetical June tropical influence (TS Alvin) as a potential downside risk.\n  • Forecaster 3 cites CPC outlooks for hotter-than-normal conditions and drought persistence, reinforcing seasonal odds of stability/worsening.\n- Assessment:\n  • The key piece is the latest point estimate: ~22.7M in D1–D4 as of the week of May 27. That puts the number about 2.7M above the threshold. Given USDM’s weekly cadence and June climatology (dry, with persistence), trimming ≥2.7M in a few weeks would require widespread removal of D1 from large metro counties—unlikely absent anomalous, widespread precipitation and multi-indicator improvement.\n  • Forecaster 2’s 68% feels low given the current margin over the threshold and seasonal inertia. Their tropical-remnant scenario is possible but atypical for June and, even if it materialized, may not immediately clear D1 across populous areas.\n  • Forecaster 3’s emphasis on heat/persistence aligns with historical patterns and supports a higher probability. I largely agree with their direction but leave a bit more room than 90% for a borderline dip if USDM makes sharper-than-expected adjustments in SoCal or the Bay Area.\n- Conclusion: Their input modestly strengthens the case for a slight upward adjustment from my prior estimate.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: ~22.7M Californians in D1–D4 as of May 27 per drought.gov, already above the 20.0M cutoff by a meaningful margin. The USDM updates weekly, and June is typically dry with persistence or expansion more common than rapid improvement. To resolve No, the count must drop by ≥2.7M within about one USDM cycle (two at most before June 28 access), which would likely require broad reclassification in populous regions—unlikely without an anomalous, impactful precipitation event and clear multi-indicator recovery.\n\nDownside risks: A rare June tropical remnant or late-season system could deliver rainfall, but translating that into immediate USDM drought removal across multiple metro counties within weeks is a stretch. Timing of Metaculus access (on/after June 28) further favors the June 26 USDM release, which is unlikely to show such a large decline.\n\nUpside risks: Seasonal heat and continued dryness could increase or maintain current coverage, making ≥20M even more likely.\n\nNet: The peers’ arguments, especially about seasonal persistence, nudge me slightly higher. I remain just below Forecaster 3 to acknowledge small but non-zero chances of a borderline dip due to classification adjustments or an unusually wet event.",
