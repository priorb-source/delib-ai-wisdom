    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 months (election day is scheduled for 2025-10-20; results typically known that night).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the Liberals are well short of majority territory in recent cycles of polling and seat models.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives maintain a double-digit national lead into the writ. The Bloc remains strong in Quebec, and the NDP holds or gains in urban cores. The Liberal vote remains in the low-to-mid 20s nationally, yielding a seat count far below 172 (e.g., dozens to low triple digits).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A dramatic and sustained realignment: a popular leadership change and/or a major Conservative stumble shifts national vote to ~40% for the Liberals. They sweep much of Ontario (especially the GTA), recapture Atlantic Canada, make big gains in Quebec at the Bloc’s expense, and stay competitive in BC—producing 172+ seats.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Over 2023–2024, national polling averages and seat models (e.g., 338Canada) consistently showed the Conservatives with a sizable lead over the Liberals, often double digits, and projecting a Conservative majority or strong plurality. That implies extremely low odds the Liberals jump all the way to 172+ seats within roughly half a year. Structural headwinds: • Incumbency fatigue after a decade in office. • Cost-of-living and housing pressures eroding Liberal support. • Bloc strength limiting Quebec seat upside. • NDP competition in urban cores and with progressive voters. • First-past-the-post seat math: to reach 172, the Liberals likely need a high-30s to ~40% national vote with very efficient distribution, which is far from recent polling baselines. Status quo weighting: The world changes slowly; absent evidence of a sustained reversal, the most likely path remains that the Liberals do not approach majority territory. Tail risks (why not 0%): Canadian campaigns can shift quickly, leadership changes can create honeymoon bounces, and a major scandal or misstep by opponents can swing vote intention. Under a rare but plausible convergence—new leader with broad appeal, sharp CPC stumble, improved sentiment on key issues—the Liberals could surge and convert vote into efficient seat wins in Ontario/Quebec/Atlantic. What would move me higher: • Multiple independent pollsters over several weeks showing Liberals leading nationally by 4–5+ points. • Quebec Liberal surge to mid-30s with Bloc slumping, plus Ontario Liberal support consistently >45%, and 338Canada (or similar) projecting 160–170+ Liberal seats with a material (>10%) majority probability. • A credible leadership change generating sustained broad-based gains. What would move me lower: • Continued or widening CPC national lead (10–15+ points) through the summer; Liberal national support <25%. • Persistent Bloc/NDP resilience narrowing Liberal paths in Quebec and urban seats. • Seat models assigning near-zero probability to a Liberal majority. Research assistant input: None provided beyond the question; forecast relies on recent historical trends, public modeling patterns up to late 2024, and structural considerations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Liberal Party win 172 or more seats in the 2025 Canadian federal election?\n\nQuestion background:\n[338Canada Federal Projection](https://338canada.com/federal.htm): \"The 338Canada project is a statistical model of electoral projections based on opinion polls, electoral history, and demographic data. This web site is a creation of Philippe J. Fournier, physics and astrophysics professor at Cégep de Saint-Laurent in Montreal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Liberal Party of Canada wins greater than or equal to 172 seats in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
