    "review": "My two fellow forecasters have reached the same conclusion as me regarding the fundamental dynamics at play: the FATF 'black list' is characterized by high inertia, making changes rare. We all agree that the removal of North Korea, Iran, or Myanmar is extremely improbable in this timeframe. We also concur that the only plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome is the addition of a new jurisdiction from the 'grey list', a step the FATF takes only as a last resort. Both other forecasters arrived at a 15% probability, slightly higher than my initial 10%. I found their reasoning convincing, particularly Forecaster 3's specific mention of fragile states on the grey list (Haiti, Yemen, Syria). This argument crystallized the abstract risk of a 'grey list' escalation into more concrete scenarios, making the slightly higher probability more compelling.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upwards from 10% to 15%. My initial analysis was correct in its core logic—the high bar for additions or removals makes 'No' the most likely outcome. However, after reviewing my peers' analyses, I believe my 10% forecast slightly understated the risk of a new jurisdiction being added to the list. \n\nThe arguments from Forecasters 2 and 3, particularly the mention of specific fragile states like Haiti, Yemen, and Syria on the grey list, were persuasive. While no single country appears to be on an obvious trajectory towards blacklisting, the presence of several unstable jurisdictions on the grey list creates multiple, independent, low-probability pathways to a 'Yes' outcome. A sudden and severe deterioration in the political or security situation in any one of these countries could prompt a rapid consensus among FATF members to escalate it to the black list. The aggregation of these small but distinct risks justifies a higher overall probability than I had initially assigned. Therefore, I am aligning with my peers' consensus forecast of 15%, which I now believe more accurately reflects the balance of probabilities.",
