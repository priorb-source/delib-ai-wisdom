  "information": "According to U.S. government data, 757 Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) incidents were reported between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. One notable incident from January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object over Arizona, resulting in damage to the aircraft's canopy.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days. The question concerns June 2025, and the outcome will be determined when Metaculus checks the NUFORC website on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo is that this specific combination of conditions (pilot report + African country + June 2025 + reported to NUFORC) does not occur. While UFO sightings happen globally, reports to NUFORC from African pilots are likely rare events.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No pilots flying in African airspace during June 2025 observe UFOs/UAPs, or if they do, they don't report them to NUFORC (a US-based reporting center). Alternatively, any such reports are submitted but not processed and posted by NUFORC before the July 1 verification date, or are categorized in a way that doesn't appear at the specified link.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial or private pilot operating in African airspace during June 2025 observes an unexplained aerial phenomenon, decides to report it to the National UFO Reporting Center despite the center being US-based, submits their report through NUFORC's website, and NUFORC processes and posts the report before July 1, 2025 at the specified link.",
    "rationale": "The provided Rwanda example from January 1, 2025 demonstrates that African pilot reports to NUFORC can and do occur, establishing this is not impossible. However, several factors suggest low probability: (1) NUFORC is primarily US-focused, receiving the vast majority of reports from North America; (2) The temporal window is narrow - only 30 days out of 365; (3) The geographic constraint is specific - only one continent out of several; (4) Must be specifically a pilot report, not general public; (5) Africa has lower commercial air traffic density than North America or Europe, reducing the pool of potential observers; (6) Potential barriers including language, internet access, and awareness of NUFORC among African pilots. The research assistant's data about 757 UAP incidents is US government data, not NUFORC data, and doesn't inform African reporting rates. If we assume African pilot reports to NUFORC occur perhaps 2-4 times annually across the entire continent, any single month would have roughly 15-30% probability. However, this may be optimistic given how US-centric NUFORC's database appears to be. My forecast would increase if: evidence showed higher historical rates of African reports to NUFORC, increased awareness campaigns in Africa, or multiple reports appearing from Africa in surrounding months. My forecast would decrease if: NUFORC's database showed virtually no recent African pilot reports, or if the Rwanda example proved to be a rare anomaly.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to U.S. government data, 757 Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) incidents were reported between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. One notable incident from January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object over Arizona, resulting in damage to the aircraft's canopy.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
