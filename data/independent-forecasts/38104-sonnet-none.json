    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (from May 30, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - at least one escapee remains at large",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One or more of the escapees successfully evade law enforcement by hiding with accomplices, fleeing to another state or country, or using false identities. Even if most are recaptured, just one remaining fugitive would result in a No outcome. Historical jailbreak data shows that while many escapees are caught quickly, it's common for at least one to remain at large for extended periods.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Law enforcement intensifies the manhunt using all available resources including federal assistance, surveillance technology, tips from the public, and coordination across jurisdictions. The remaining escapees make mistakes, are betrayed by associates, or are located through routine police work. All captures occur within the 32-day window before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The article from May 19 indicates 7 of 10 escapees remained at large three days after the May 16 escape, meaning 3 were quickly recaptured. Today is May 30, giving us 14 days of elapsed time since that report. Typically in jailbreak scenarios, there's a rapid initial recapture phase (which already occurred with 3 caught early), followed by a much slower phase where remaining escapees are harder to locate. The question requires ALL 10 to be recaptured or killed - this is a stringent requirement where even one escapee remaining at large results in No. Historical jailbreak data shows that while 50-70% of escapees are typically caught within weeks, it's common for 1-2 to evade capture for months or longer. With 32 days remaining until July 1, authorities have a reasonable but not abundant timeframe. The status quo strongly suggests several escapees remain at large. For a higher forecast, I'd need evidence of more recent recaptures or information about cornered suspects. For a lower forecast, I'd need evidence that escapees have successfully fled the region or established hiding places. The 43% probability reflects the high bar of requiring all recaptures combined with the typical pattern that at least one escapee from a group this large often remains at large beyond 6 weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in the [2025 New Orleans jailbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Orleans_jailbreak) have been either recaptured or killed, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions). If any are still at large on July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
