    "review": "Both forecasters provide excellent, well-structured analyses that converge on a 12% probability. Their core reasoning aligns with my own, emphasizing the high stability and institutional inertia of the FATF black list. I found two points particularly insightful. First, Forecaster 3's emphasis on the short, three-month timeframe since the February 2025 plenary, where no changes were made, is a powerful argument for the status quo. Second, both forecasters correctly frame the unique situation with Russia—its current suspension being a significant but distinct action from blacklisting—as the most plausible, albeit unlikely, source of a potential 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 2's mention of Pakistan and India effectively illustrates that even countries under renewed scrutiny are far more likely to be grey-listed than blacklisted directly. While their reasoning strongly supports a low probability, their final forecasts of 12% suggest they are weighting the tail risk of a political surprise, particularly concerning Russia, slightly more heavily than I initially did.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am adjusting my forecast slightly upward. My initial reasoning, grounded in the black list's historical stability, remains sound. The points raised by the other forecasters, especially the short interval since the last plenary, reinforce my belief that the most probable outcome is 'No'. However, their shared focus on Russia's unprecedented suspension has convinced me that I was underweighting this specific tail risk. A direct blacklisting of a major nation like Russia would be a norm-breaking, politically-driven event, but the current geopolitical climate makes such low-probability events more plausible than in normal times. While the FATF is a slow-moving, technical body, it is not entirely insulated from such pressures. The consensus forecast of 12% from my peers suggests that I may have been overly confident in procedural normalcy. I am therefore moving my forecast from 8% to 10% to better account for the non-trivial, though still remote, possibility of an exceptional political decision to add Russia to the list.",
