    "review": "The other two forecasters reached similar conclusions to my own, with forecasts of 8% and 12% bracketing my initial 10%. We all agree that the low historical base rate of such reports is the dominant factor. Forecaster 2 made a strong point by highlighting alternative local reporting channels in South America, reinforcing why reporting to a US-based entity like NUFORC is rare. Forecaster 3 introduced a more formal Poisson process model, which effectively translates the annual rate of 1-2 reports into a monthly probability range of approximately 8-17%, adding analytical rigor that supports our collective forecast range. Forecaster 3 also helpfully identified specific 'real-world friction' failure modes, such as administrative delays in posting or incorrect report tagging, which could cause a valid event to not resolve the question as 'Yes'. I found both analyses highly convincing as they sharpened the reasoning without fundamentally contradicting the core evidence.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 10%. The deliberation process has reinforced my confidence in this probability. My initial forecast was based on a direct translation of the historical rate of 1-2 reports per year into a monthly probability. The other forecasters' analyses have provided a more robust framework for this assessment. Specifically, Forecaster 3's application of a Poisson distribution with an annual rate (λ) between 1 and 2 yields a monthly probability range of roughly 8% to 15%. My 10% forecast sits comfortably within this calculated range. The arguments from Forecaster 2 about structural barriers (e.g., preference for local reporting channels) and from Forecaster 3 about operational friction (e.g., posting delays) are valid downward pressures. However, these factors are already reflected in the very low historical base rate we are using for our calculations. Therefore, while these points add valuable context, they don't necessitate a significant shift from my initial estimate, which already accounted for the rarity of the event. The group consensus is tightly clustered around 10%, suggesting this is a stable estimate given the available data.",
