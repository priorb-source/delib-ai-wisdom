    "review": "Both forecasters raise a critical point I underweighted: **four months have elapsed** since the January 2025 executive order without the North America page changing. This is powerful evidence against a Yes outcome. If WorldAtlas intended to adopt this change on their main map page, they've had ample time to do so. The continued inaction is more informative than I initially credited.\n\nForecaster 2's emphasis on WorldAtlas as a commercial site not bound by government conventions is well-taken, though I had considered this. Forecaster 3's point about institutional conservatism of reference websites resonates - these sites prioritize stability and international consensus over political naming preferences.\n\nI now see my original forecast was too optimistic about the article title's significance. The parenthetical '(Gulf of America)' in the article likely represents acknowledging a newsworthy controversy rather than signaling intent to change primary geographic labels. Article pages (documenting current events) and map pages (providing stable geographic reference) serve different functions.\n\nThe combination of: (1) no change to the North America page in 4 months despite the article acknowledgment, (2) lack of international recognition/consensus, and (3) reference sites' typical conservatism presents a much stronger case for status quo than I initially assessed.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I weighted the article title evidence too heavily and the **absence of change over 4 months** too lightly. The most parsimonious explanation for why WorldAtlas updated their article title but not their North America page is that they view these as serving different purposes - one documenting current events, the other providing stable geographic reference.\n\nWith only 54 days remaining and no movement in 120+ days since the executive order, the probability of change is lower than my initial assessment. However, I remain slightly higher than Forecaster 2's 15% because: (1) the resolution criteria explicitly allow both names appearing together, which is less demanding than full replacement, (2) websites can update quickly when motivated, and (3) 54 days is still non-trivial time.\n\nI'm updating down significantly but not as low as 15% because the article acknowledgment does show some editorial flexibility, and sudden website changes remain possible even after extended inaction.",
