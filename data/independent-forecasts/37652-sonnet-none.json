    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks from May 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - Mark Carney is not currently Canadian Prime Minister",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Mark Carney does not become Canadian Prime Minister by July 1, 2025, which means Morning Consult would not track his approval rating as 'Canadian Prime Minister' and the comparison cannot be made. Alternatively, he becomes PM but has a lower or equal approval rating to Trump.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mark Carney becomes Canadian Prime Minister within the next 6.5 weeks through an extraordinary political transition (such as Justin Trudeau resigning and Carney being appointed or winning a rapid leadership race), Morning Consult begins tracking his approval rating as PM, and that rating exceeds Trump's when measured on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The fundamental issue with this question is that Mark Carney is not currently the Canadian Prime Minister - Justin Trudeau holds that position. For this question to resolve as Yes, Carney would need to become PM in just 6.5 weeks AND have a higher approval rating than Trump. Canadian leadership transitions typically take months, not weeks. A Liberal Party leadership race would need to occur, or Trudeau would need to resign with Carney appointed as interim leader. Even in crisis scenarios, this timeline is extremely compressed. There are no current indications of such a transition being imminent. Without holding the office of Prime Minister, Morning Consult would not track Carney's approval rating in the relevant 'Canadian Prime Minister' category. The status quo strongly favors NO since the precondition (Carney being PM) is not met and is unlikely to be met in such a short timeframe. My forecast is not higher because there is no evidence suggesting an imminent leadership change in Canada. My forecast is not lower (i.e., not 0-1%) only because unexpected political events occasionally occur, though a complete leadership transition in 6.5 weeks would be unprecedented. I would update significantly higher only if credible reports emerged of Trudeau's imminent resignation with Carney positioned as successor.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mark Carney has a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
