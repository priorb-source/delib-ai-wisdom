  "information": "Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has publicly stated to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that 'Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal.' Former Bulgarian Deputy Energy Minister Zhecho Stankov stated that termination of the contract is blocked until the outstanding debt is fully settled. Despite the public statements, talks between the two countries as of May 2, 2025, focused on price and capacity renegotiation rather than outright cancellation. Turkey has publicly maintained a stance of viewing Bulgaria as a strategic partner and has opposed cancellation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "25 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the agreement continues with ongoing renegotiations",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations between Bulgaria and Turkey continue to focus on price and capacity adjustments rather than cancellation. The debt settlement issue remains unresolved but discussions continue. Neither party makes an announcement of cancellation before July 1, and the agreement remains technically in force despite ongoing tensions and modifications.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Financial pressure from Bulgargaz's debt situation becomes critical, forcing Bulgaria to unilaterally announce termination of the agreement despite Turkish opposition. Alternatively, negotiations break down completely in the next 25 days, leading one party to formally announce cancellation even if the other disputes it.",
    "rationale": "With only 25 days remaining, the status quo strongly favors a No outcome. The research assistant's report indicates that as recently as May 2, 2025, bilateral talks were focused on price and capacity renegotiation rather than outright cancellation. This is significant because it shows the actual negotiation track differs from Borissov's public rhetoric about 'needing out.' Turkey maintains opposition to cancellation and views Bulgaria as a strategic partner, creating diplomatic resistance. The requirement that debts must be settled before termination presents a structural barrier. However, several factors prevent this from being near-zero probability: (1) Borissov's public statements demonstrate political will, (2) Bulgargaz's reported financial distress could precipitate crisis action, (3) the resolution criteria allow for unilateral announcement even if disputed. The forecast is not higher because the short timeframe makes dramatic policy shifts unlikely, ongoing talks suggest a path toward modification rather than termination, and institutional barriers exist. It's not lower because financial stress and political rhetoric create some genuine possibility of a forced outcome. For this to move higher, I would need evidence of negotiations collapsing, imminent bankruptcy declarations, or new political imperatives. For it to move lower, successful renegotiation announcements or debt settlement progress would be required.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Botas Gas Agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey be cancelled before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Borissov to Erdogan: Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal](https://www.novinite.com/articles/232423/Borissov+to+Erdogan%3A+Bulgaria+Needs+Out+of+the+Botas+Gas+Deal) | [Bulgargaz on verge of bankrupty due to debts to Turkish gas company BOTAS: Turkish media](https://www.turkiyetoday.com/business/bulgargaz-on-verge-of-bankrupty-due-to-debts-to-turkish-gas-company-botas-turkish-med-3201881)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, the natural gas transmission agreement between Bulgargaz EAD and BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corp is announced by either party as being cancelled.\n\nTermination of the agreement by either side, even if denied by the other side, would still count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has publicly stated to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that 'Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
