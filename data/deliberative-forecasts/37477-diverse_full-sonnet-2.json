    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 raised critical points I underweighted. Most importantly, Forecaster 3 identified that there have been ZERO qualifying days since mid-April - approximately 20-28 publication days with no instance where both papers omitted 'tariff(s)' simultaneously. This empirical track record is powerful evidence that the per-day probability of omission is very low, likely 1-3%. Forecaster 2 correctly reframed the question: we need just ONE qualifying day in 22-23 remaining days, not continuous absence. Their probabilistic approach is sound, though their 94% daily coverage assumption seems too optimistic given the zero-success observation. Using Bayesian reasoning: if ~25 past days yielded 0 successes, the daily success probability is approximately 1-3%, which over 22 remaining days gives cumulative probability of 20-49%. Forecaster 3's 45% sits in the middle of this range. My original 20% essentially assumed p_daily ≈ 1%, which may be slightly pessimistic but isn't unreasonable given the perfect non-qualifying streak. However, I didn't properly aggregate this over the remaining timeframe. The key tension: tariffs remain highly salient (April 2 EO, ongoing economic impacts, active political debate), supporting low daily probability, but 22-23 days provides multiple opportunities for one break in coverage.",
    "rationale": "The zero-success empirical record since mid-April is the most important evidence. This suggests the daily probability that both papers omit 'tariff(s)' is 1-3%. The tariff story remains active and multifaceted: recent executive order, economic impacts, political debate about replacing income taxes, WSJ editorial criticism. Both papers have strong incentives to continue coverage. However, with 22-23 remaining publication days, even a low daily probability compounds to a meaningful cumulative chance. Using p_daily = 2%: 1 - (0.98)^22 ≈ 36%. Using p_daily = 1.5%: 1 - (0.985)^22 ≈ 28%. The observed perfect non-qualifying streak argues for the lower end of this range. News cycles can shift unpredictably, but we need both papers to pivot simultaneously, which is constraining. Weekend editions might offer slightly higher omission probability. I'm updating from 20% to 28%, acknowledging the cumulative probability math while respecting the strong empirical evidence of persistent coverage. This sits between my original forecast and Forecaster 3's 45%, reflecting that the zero-success track record is more informative than I initially weighted.",
