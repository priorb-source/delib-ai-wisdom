    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that challenge my initial 28% forecast. They emphasize critical factors I underweighted: (1) The extraordinarily strong historical pattern - nearly two decades of Dodik threatening referendums without ever setting a date for independence, (2) The immediate and severe nature of consequences (not just eventual, but instant sanctions and economic isolation), (3) Serbia's position as a crucial missing piece - focused on its own EU path and historically discouraging formal secession, (4) The fundamental insight from Forecaster 3 that the threat itself is more valuable to Dodik than the action. Forecaster 2's point about RS's economy being too interwoven with EU markets to absorb sharp escalation is particularly important. While I correctly identified recent escalation (constitutional consultations, laws against central authorities), I failed to adequately recognize that such brinkmanship fits Dodik's established pattern rather than representing a genuine departure from it. The base rate argument is strong: if he hasn't crossed this line in nearly two decades despite multiple crises and provocations, why would he do so now with only 60 days remaining and no new game-changing factor (Serbia still opposed, Russia supportive but not decisively so)?",
    "rationale": "I am significantly lowering my forecast based on the deliberation. My initial 28% overweighted recent escalatory actions and underweighted the powerful historical pattern and structural constraints. The decades-long track record shows Dodik consistently uses referendum threats as leverage without following through on the decisive step of announcing an independence referendum date. The immediate costs (severe US/EU sanctions, economic isolation) combined with lack of support from Serbia create overwhelming disincentives. While recent actions (constitutional draft, laws banning central authorities) represent serious escalation, they still fit within Dodik's established brinkmanship pattern rather than signaling an imminent referendum announcement. The 60-day timeframe is sufficient for an announcement but also limits the window for an acute crisis to force RS's hand. I'm settling on 15%, aligning with Forecaster 2's analysis, which I find most persuasive in balancing the genuine volatility and tail risks (acute confrontations, miscalculation) against the strong base rate of non-action. This acknowledges that while highly unlikely, the possibility isn't negligible given the charged environment and Dodik's unpredictability.",
