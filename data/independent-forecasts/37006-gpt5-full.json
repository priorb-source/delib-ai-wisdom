  "information": "In the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections, the Bloc Québécois won 32 seats in Quebec, while the Conservative Party of Canada won 10 seats in each of those elections. Historically, the Bloc has won more seats in Quebec than the Conservatives in the last five to seven elections.\n\nRecent polling data shows a shift in voter support in Quebec. Bloc Québécois support has declined from 37% to a range of 23-27%. Conservative support has remained stable at approximately 23%. The Liberal Party has seen its support surge to between 40-42%. Aggregated polls from sources like Nanos, CROP, Abacus Data, and Ipsos show the Bloc leading the Conservatives by 5 to 17 percentage points province-wide.\n\nSeat projection models, including Canada388 and The Writ, estimate the Bloc Québécois will win between 19 and 25 seats. Projections for the Conservative Party place their seat count between 10 and 12. The increase in Liberal support is reported to primarily affect the Bloc's vote share rather than the Conservatives'. The Conservative party's support is most concentrated in the Quebec City region and its south shore.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 months (election expected October 20, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives gain markedly in Quebec (into the high-20s/low-30s), while the Bloc slips into the high-teens/low-20s. CPC converts Quebec City, the South Shore, Beauce, and makes inroads in Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean and parts of the Eastern Townships, lifting them to the mid-to-high teens in Quebec seats while the Bloc falls to the low teens.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Current dynamics persist: Liberals lead Quebec decisively (~40%+), the Bloc stabilizes in the mid-20s, and Conservatives remain around ~23% with support concentrated around Quebec City and Chaudière-Appalaches. Result: Bloc wins roughly 19–25 Quebec seats, Conservatives about 10–12.",
    "rationale": "Baseline and recent evidence point to the Bloc winning more Quebec seats than the Conservatives. Historically, the Bloc has outpaced the Conservatives in Quebec across recent cycles; in both 2019 and 2021 the Bloc won 32 Quebec seats while the Conservatives won 10. The provided polling snapshot shows the Bloc down from ~37% to ~23–27%, Conservatives roughly ~23%, and Liberals surging to ~40–42%. Even with that Bloc decline, aggregated polls reportedly still have the Bloc ahead of the Conservatives in Quebec by multiple points, and seat models (Canada338 / The Writ as summarized) project Bloc ~19–25 seats versus Conservatives ~10–12. That distribution implies a clear edge for a Yes resolution. Structurally, Bloc support tends to be more efficiently distributed across francophone regions than the Conservatives’ more concentrated pockets around Quebec City and its south shore. The National Post note about a Conservative candidate unable to run in Quebec City further underscores organizational/ballot-access risks in the very region where CPC gains are most plausible. The Walrus piece suggests Liberal strength is cannibalizing Bloc vote share; the assistant’s summary also indicates Liberal gains hit the Bloc more than the Conservatives. That dynamic can hand some three-way races to the Conservatives, but, on net, current projections still leave the Bloc with a sizable seat edge. Why not higher than 75? There are about six months to go. A Conservative late-campaign surge among francophones (helped by debate performance or endorsements) or a further Bloc slide into the teens could flip a dozen ridings and allow CPC to edge the Bloc in seats despite similar vote shares. Quebec’s three-way races can swing sharply on modest shifts and turnout patterns. Why not lower than 75? The status quo strongly favors the Bloc on both polls and seat projections; the Conservatives’ Quebec base remains geographically narrow; and recent candidate/organizational hiccups in Quebec City cap near-term upside. What would move me up: sustained polling with Bloc ≥25% and CPC ≤22–23%, renewed riding-level evidence that the Bloc remains first in key CAQ-leaning regions, and seat models widening the Bloc–CPC Quebec seat gap (e.g., Bloc median ≥22 vs CPC ≤10). What would move me down: Quebec polls showing CPC clearly overtaking the Bloc by ≥3–4 points for several weeks, crosstabs with CPC leading francophones outside Quebec City, credible CAQ-leaning endorsements/shifts toward CPC, or updated seat models putting CPC’s Quebec median at or above the Bloc’s.",
