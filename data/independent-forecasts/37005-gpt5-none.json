    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 months (election expected Oct 20, 2025; results known election night)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — current polling and projections imply the Liberals are far short of a majority (172 seats with the 343-seat map).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Conservatives maintain a double‑digit national lead through the campaign; Liberals finish well under 172 seats, with limited gains in Ontario, continued Bloc strength in Quebec, and Conservative dominance in the West.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A late, dramatic realignment: Liberals change leader to a broadly popular figure, consolidate progressive voters as NDP support collapses, a major Conservative scandal erodes their lead, and the Liberals surge to large margins in Ontario and make significant gains in Quebec and Atlantic Canada, yielding 172+ seats.",
    "rationale": "Time horizon: Roughly half a year remains. Most election fundamentals are already in place and typically shift gradually.\n\nStatus quo: For many months, reputable Canadian poll aggregators have shown the Conservatives leading the Liberals by a substantial (often double‑digit) margin nationally. Seat projection models such as 338Canada translate that into a Conservative advantage and the Liberals far from majority territory. With the new 343-seat House, a majority is 172; the Liberals are not currently projected near that level.\n\nBase rates and fundamentals: Incumbency fatigue after a decade in office, cost-of-living and housing concerns, and the opposition leader’s sustained popularity advantage make a Liberal rebound to 172+ a very high bar. Even in optimistic scenarios, recovering from a large national polling deficit to a clear majority in six months is historically rare in Canada.\n\nPaths to Yes exist but are extreme: Canada has seen big late swings (e.g., 2015), so I won’t put the probability at near‑zero. A credible path would likely require multiple low‑probability events happening together: a leadership change that meaningfully improves Liberal net favorables, a sharp Conservative stumble or scandal, a rapid economic/housing sentiment improvement, and a sizable NDP-to-Liberal consolidation, especially in Ontario and parts of Quebec. Without several of these, reaching 172 seats is implausible given regional dynamics (Bloc strength in Quebec, Conservative strength in the West).\n\nWhy not higher: Current polling/seat models keep the Liberals far from majority territory; they would need a 10–15+ point national swing and very efficient vote distribution. Why not lower: Tail risks remain—Canada’s multiparty system and past volatility mean a late surge is not impossible, particularly if leadership dynamics change.\n\nWhat would move me up: (1) A Liberal leadership change with immediate, sustained polling within ~3–5 points of the Conservatives nationally; (2) clear Liberal leads in Ontario and competitiveness in Quebec in multiple independent polls; (3) a major Conservative scandal that persists for weeks; (4) evidence of NDP vote collapsing to the Liberals in seat-rich suburbs. What would move me down: (1) The Conservatives maintaining a 10+ point lead into late summer; (2) continued weak Liberal approvals under the same leadership; (3) little movement in Ontario/Quebec battlegrounds per multiple polls; (4) further Liberal retirements or organizational setbacks.\n\nResearch assistant note: No additional information provided; the assessment relies on widely reported polling trends and known electoral fundamentals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Liberal Party win 172 or more seats in the 2025 Canadian federal election?\n\nQuestion background:\n[338Canada Federal Projection](https://338canada.com/federal.htm): \"The 338Canada project is a statistical model of electoral projections based on opinion polls, electoral history, and demographic data. This web site is a creation of Philippe J. Fournier, physics and astrophysics professor at Cégep de Saint-Laurent in Montreal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Liberal Party of Canada wins greater than or equal to 172 seats in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
