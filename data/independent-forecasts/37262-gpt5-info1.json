  "information": "In April 2025, several protests occurred in India related to land and religious laws. On April 14, protests against a Muslim land law in eastern India turned violent, resulting in three reported deaths. Separately, from April 8-12, violent protests against the Waqf Act took place in Murshidabad, West Bengal. Muslim communities also held symbolic \"Lights Off\" protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025. Ongoing communal tensions have been noted in West Bengal and Uttarakhand.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the tracker does not add any new India protests with 10,000+ participants by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Protests continue in pockets (e.g., related to the Waqf/land laws or communal tensions) but stay locally concentrated and/or below 10,000 participants per event, or they are not judged sufficiently nationwide/sustained for inclusion; Carnegie’s Global Protest Tracker does not add a new India entry in May–June 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A clearly large-scale mobilization (10,000+ participants) starts after the question’s launch—e.g., a nationwide call over the Waqf (Amendment) Act, communal/land issues, exams/jobs, or another political flashpoint—drawing tens of thousands in one or multiple cities; Carnegie adds this protest to the Global Protest Tracker with a qualifying start date before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- What we know now: Your assistant notes multiple April 2025 protests tied to land and religious issues (e.g., violent protests against a Muslim land law on Apr 14 with reported fatalities; Apr 8–12 Murshidabad unrest over the Waqf Act; symbolic “Lights Off” actions). Despite these, the criteria “have not yet been satisfied,” implying the Global Protest Tracker (GPT) has not recorded a qualifying India protest so far.\n- Base rates and tracker behavior: India frequently sees large protests (10k+ is not rare by Indian standards), but the GPT is selective and often highlights only major, nationwide, or highly salient episodes. New entries for India appear infrequently compared to the volume of local protests. GPT updates can lag by weeks or longer, which matters given the ~60-day window.\n- Status quo weighting: If nothing major changes, the most likely outcome is No—ongoing, localized unrest does not translate into a GPT-listed, 10k+ event by July 1. The April incidents have not yet produced a GPT entry, which is a mild negative signal for near-term inclusion unless the movement broadens.\n- Why not higher: The key bottleneck is not whether 10k+ protests can occur in India (they can), but whether GPT will deem a new episode noteworthy enough to add within the time window. The tracker’s selectivity and update cadence, plus the absence (so far) of a clearly national mobilization post-launch, keep the probability in check.\n- Why not lower: The environment is combustible. Issues like the Waqf (Amendment) Act, communal tensions, and recurring student/jobs protests can scale quickly to 10k+. A single large nationwide call (by major parties, unions, or religious organizations) could meet the threshold, and 10k is a relatively low hurdle in urban India.\n- What would move me up: Verified reports of large coordinated demonstrations (10k+ in a major city or simultaneous large rallies across states); a national strike/’bandh’ call; evidence GPT is actively adding new 2025 entries for other countries in near real time (suggesting faster updates); Reuters/BBC/Al Jazeera/Indian national outlets reporting explicit crowd sizes and national scope.\n- What would move me down: A tapering of unrest; no major national calls; GPT showing few or no updates through May–June; official clampdowns keeping events dispersed and under reported thresholds.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in India with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nA protest with at least 10,000 participants that is active at the launch of this question does not count for resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn April 2025, several protests occurred in India related to land and religious laws. On April 14, protests against a Muslim land law in eastern India turned violent, resulting in three reported deaths. Separately, from April 8-12, violent protests against the Waqf Act took place in Murshidabad, West Bengal. Muslim communities also held symbolic \"Lights Off\" protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025. Ongoing communal tensions have been noted in West Bengal and Uttarakhand.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
