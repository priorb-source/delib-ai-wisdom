    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days remain until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new nuclear deal is announced. The default outcome is continuation of the current strained US-Iran relations without a formal nuclear agreement.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations either do not materialize or fail to reach agreement in the remaining weeks due to fundamental disagreements over enrichment levels, sanctions relief, verification mechanisms, or domestic political opposition in either country. Regional tensions with Israel and Gulf states may also complicate any deal-making efforts.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Intensive behind-the-scenes negotiations that have been underway accelerate in the final weeks of the deadline. Both parties, motivated by regional security concerns or political expediency, reach a framework agreement or interim deal that is publicly announced before July 1. This could be a preliminary agreement-in-principle rather than a fully detailed treaty.",
    "rationale": "The Israeli media report citing senior ministers believing there is a 'high chance' of a US-Iran agreement is the most significant piece of evidence. Israeli intelligence generally has strong sources on US-Iran matters given their strategic interests. However, several factors limit confidence: (1) The timeframe is extremely short at just 47 days - major nuclear agreements typically require months or years of negotiation, not weeks. (2) The history of US-Iran nuclear diplomacy shows extreme difficulty - the JCPOA took years to negotiate initially and collapsed after US withdrawal in 2018. Revival efforts have consistently stalled. (3) Domestic political constraints exist in both countries. (4) No research assistant information confirms active negotiations or recent progress. The term 'sign or announce an agreement' provides some flexibility - an announcement of a framework deal or agreement-in-principle would qualify, not necessarily a fully implemented treaty. This lowers the bar somewhat. Base rates argue strongly against: comprehensive international nuclear agreements are rare events, and US-Iran deals specifically have proven extraordinarily difficult. However, the credible Israeli intelligence report prevents dismissing this entirely. My forecast is not higher because of the very compressed timeframe and absence of corroborating evidence of active negotiations. It is not lower because credible intelligence sources suggest something substantive may be developing, and the question allows for an 'announcement' rather than requiring full implementation. Updates upward would require: confirmed reports of active negotiations, public statements from US/Iranian officials about progress, or news of specific compromise proposals. Updates downward would require: explicit denials from either party, absence of any negotiation news, or escalating tensions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States and Iran announce a new nuclear deal before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nIsraeli media (Hebrew): [Senior ministers were informed: There is a high chance that the US and Iran will reach an agreement](https://www.kan.org.il/content/kan-news/politic/895178/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the US and Iran sign or announce an agreement with respect to Iran's nuclear program.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
