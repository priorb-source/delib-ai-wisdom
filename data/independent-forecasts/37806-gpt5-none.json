    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days (until 2025-06-30, 23:59 local DC time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration focuses its near-term immigration actions on border/asylum/parole and broader enforcement. Any immigration orders avoid explicitly referencing the Diversity Visa program, or use different terminology (e.g., “diversity immigrant program”), and no presidential action containing the exact words “Diversity Visa” is posted on the White House presidential actions page by June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The White House issues a proclamation or executive order under INA 212(f) or similar that suspends or restricts entries or processing for Diversity Visa selectees, or bundles DV changes into a broader immigration action. The text explicitly includes the exact phrase “Diversity Visa,” and it is posted on the presidential actions page before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and timing: With roughly six weeks left, most presidential actions likely to post are already in drafting/clearance. The status quo—no DV-specific action—tends to persist absent clear signals.  \n- Specificity hurdle: The resolution requires the exact phrase “Diversity Visa.” Even when administrations target that program, official texts often use terms like “diversity immigrant program” or “DV category.” That wording constraint lowers the hit rate.  \n- Agenda priorities: Early second-term immigration moves have centered on border enforcement, asylum, and parole. Targeting the DV program (about 55,000 visas annually and statutorily created) yields limited immediate impact relative to political cost and litigation risk, making it less likely to be prioritized in the next 41 days.  \n- Precedent: While Trump has criticized the lottery and previous proclamations affected DV issuance indirectly, explicit mentions in presidential actions are uncommon.  \n- Why not higher: No public signals or leaks of an imminent DV-focused action; short time window; exact-phrase requirement.  \n- Why not lower: Trump has a history of criticizing the DV lottery; a single broad immigration proclamation could include a clause that explicitly names “Diversity Visa,” which would satisfy the criterion even if DV isn’t the main focus.  \n- Updates that would move this upward: Credible reporting or OMB/OIRA review notes on a forthcoming immigration EO/proclamation mentioning DV; White House or State/DHS briefings referencing changes to the DV program; leaked draft text.  \n- Updates that would move this downward: Continued absence of immigration actions referencing DV as we approach late June; indications that the next immigration package targets only border/asylum without touching visa categories.  \n- Research assistant summary: No additional information available, so the forecast leans on base rates, agenda analysis, and wording constraints.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
