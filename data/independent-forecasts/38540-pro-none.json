    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 weeks. The question resolves on or after July 1, 2025, and today is June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Currently, an OpenAI model (e.g., an iteration of GPT-4o or a successor) holds the #1 position on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard. If nothing changes, this will still be the case on July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "In the next two weeks, a competitor such as Anthropic or Google releases a new flagship model (e.g., Claude 4, Gemini 3 Ultra). The model is immediately added to the Chatbot Arena and proves to be a significant improvement, rapidly accumulating enough positive human preference votes to surpass OpenAI's model and claim the #1 overall rank by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "OpenAI's current leading model maintains its performance edge and top ranking through the end of the quarter. No competitor releases a model powerful enough to dethrone it in the short time remaining, or if they do, it is not integrated and evaluated on the Arena in time to take the #1 spot by July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo and the extremely short time horizon. As of today, an OpenAI model is ranked #1. With only about two weeks until the resolution date, the incumbent has a massive advantage. Leaderboard rankings, especially Elo-based ones like the Chatbot Arena, have significant inertia. A new challenger would need to be released, integrated into the platform, and undergo a very large number of blind comparisons to accumulate enough data to overtake the long-standing leader. This process typically takes more than two weeks to stabilize for a top spot. \n\nThe primary reason my forecast is not higher than 90% is the intense and dynamic nature of the AI industry. A surprise, SOTA-beating model release from a major competitor like Google or Anthropic is the most significant risk. These companies are highly motivated to claim the top spot and could have a release timed for the end of the quarter. However, a release being powerful enough and capturing the lead within this specific two-week window is a high bar.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the operational and logistical hurdles for a competitor are substantial. Even if a superior model is announced tomorrow, its path to the #1 spot on this specific leaderboard by July 1st is fraught with delays (API access, integration into the Arena, accumulating sufficient votes). Therefore, the most probable outcome is that the current state persists for the next two weeks.\n\nI would increase my forecast if the next week passes with no major competitor announcements. I would significantly decrease my forecast if Google, Anthropic, or another major lab announces a new flagship model and its immediate availability on a public platform.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill an OpenAI model be ranked #1 overall on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of the 2nd Quarter of 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMethodology: [Chatbot Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating LLMs by Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a model owned by OpenAI is in the number 1 overall rank (ties count) at the [Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this is not the case, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nScroll down to Arena Overview and the resolution is based on the \"overall\" rank.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
