    "review": "My initial forecast of 35% was based on a reported delay of a 'dashboard system'. Reviewing my peers' analyses, I find Forecaster 2's reasoning highly convincing and impactful. They provided a crucial piece of new information that I had not considered: the delay is not just a technical issue but a fundamental disagreement over data interception and national security, with talks described as being at a 'preliminary stage' recently. This is a much more serious and time-consuming obstacle than I had initially assumed.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis, while acknowledging Starlink's regional capacity, seems to be based on a flawed premise. Their assertion that there are 'no reports of outstanding issues' is directly contradicted by the information both myself and Forecaster 2 have. They overweigh the importance of the initial license grant from August 2024 and underweight the significance of recent, specific roadblocks. Therefore, I find their 85% forecast unconvincingly high.\n\nForecaster 2's argument about the complexity and typically slow pace of national security negotiations provides the best explanation for the missed April deadline and casts serious doubt on a resolution within the next six weeks. Their 20% forecast aligns well with this new, more pessimistic context.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast significantly downward based on the new information provided by Forecaster 2. My original analysis correctly identified that a delay had occurred and that a missed deadline was a strong negative signal. However, I had characterized the problem as a technical/bureaucratic hurdle ('dashboard system'). Realizing the issue is rooted in national security and data interception negotiations changes the-calculus entirely.\n\nThese types of negotiations are fundamentally more complex and politically sensitive than technical compliance checks. The fact that talks were at a 'preliminary stage' so close to the deadline makes the path to resolution before July 1 extremely narrow. The initial license approval is now a secondary factor; the primary driver is the current impasse over a critical security issue. While a high-level political intervention could theoretically break the deadlock, the default path for such negotiations is a lengthy one. Given this new information, the probability of Starlink becoming available in Sri Lanka before the deadline is much lower than I first assessed.\n\nTherefore, I am lowering my forecast from 35% to 20%, aligning with Forecaster 2. This reflects a small chance of a rapid political resolution but acknowledges that the most likely outcome is a continued delay well past the resolution date.",
