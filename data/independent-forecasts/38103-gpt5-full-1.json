  "information": "As of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro officially excluded Tesla products, including electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters, from its CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs. The stated reason for the policy change is to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S.-produced goods where practicable, as part of a broader trade dispute. The EV charger rebate for single-family homes covers up to 50% of the cost, to a maximum of $350. The policy was publicly defended by B.C. Premier David Eby and Energy Minister Adrian Dix. Products purchased or pre-approved before March 12, 2025, remain eligible for the rebate.\n\nIn the Canadian market, Tesla has experienced a significant downturn in early 2025. New vehicle registrations in Québec dropped by 85-90% in the first quarter of the year. Concurrently, a J.D. Power survey indicated a shift in Canadian consumer preference, with Tesla falling from second to eighth place among most-considered EV brands. Other manufacturers, such as General Motors, surpassed Tesla as the top seller of EVs in Canada during this period. Public sentiment has also been a factor, with protests occurring at a B.C. Tesla dealership on March 23, 2025, where participants called for a boycott of the company.\n\nThe exclusion of Tesla from B.C.'s rebate program occurred within a broader context of shifting trade policies and incentives. Canada's federal iZEV rebate program, which offered up to $5,000 for EV purchases, ended on March 31, 2025. A 25% tariff on U.S.-made electric vehicles is also in effect. The B.C. government's action to preference domestic goods extends beyond the EV sector; for instance, the province has also removed U.S. liquor products from the shelves of government-run liquor stores as part of the ongoing trade friction with the United States.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BC Hydro updates the rebate page to remove the explicit brand-level exclusion (e.g., replaces “Tesla products are not eligible” with generic criteria like “Canadian-made only”), or the single-family home charger rebate page/program is paused or restructured so that Tesla is no longer mentioned as ineligible.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current policy and page language remain in place and the BC Hydro rebate page still explicitly states that Tesla products are not eligible for the single-family home EV charger rebate.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: As of Mar 12, 2025, BC Hydro explicitly excludes Tesla products from CleanBC/BC Hydro rebates, including the single-family home EV charger rebate. This was publicly defended by the Premier and Energy Minister, framed as preferencing Canadian goods and excluding U.S.-produced goods “where practicable.” Short timeline to July 1 favors policy inertia.\n- Page-dependent resolution: The question resolves on whether the specific BC Hydro page says Tesla is not eligible. Even if the underlying policy remains, if the page stops naming Tesla explicitly by July 1, the outcome resolves No. That is the main risk channel.\n- Why not higher: (1) Communications/legal risk could prompt BC Hydro to switch to non-brand-specific language before July 1; (2) Program-page restructuring or temporary pause could remove the explicit Tesla line; (3) A rapid political reversal is possible but less likely in the short run.\n- Why not lower: (1) Status quo is clear and recently reaffirmed; (2) Only about a month remains—too little time for trade or legal processes to force a reversal; (3) The rebate amount is modest, limiting pressure to change quickly; (4) Officials have publicly defended the decision, suggesting they will keep the explicit exclusion visible to guide consumers.\n- Update triggers upward: Public reaffirmation that Tesla remains excluded and continued explicit brand mention on the page in late June; any BC Hydro content updates that retain the brand-specific wording.\n- Update triggers downward: Evidence of a communications shift away from naming Tesla (e.g., moving to generic eligibility criteria), program suspension/revamp of the single-family home rebate page, or credible reporting of an imminent policy reversal before July 1.\n- Research assistant highlights that the exclusion is part of a broader push to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S.-produced goods where practicable, and that provincial leadership defended the move. That supports stickiness through July 1. I discount broader market-share and protest details as secondary to the immediate, page-based criterion and short lead time.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill BC Hydro still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates. If you purchased or have received pre-approval for your Tesla product before March 12, 2025, it can still qualify for rebates and will be processed as normal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if BC Hydro at [this page](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebates-home-chargers.html) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, says that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program. If it does not mention Tesla being ineligible, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro officially excluded Tesla products, including electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters, from its CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
