    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the core constraints I cited: martial law, constitutional/legal prohibitions, and political reluctance. New/useful angles: (1) Forecaster 2’s “aid-for-date” scenario (diplomatic pressure prompting a declarative announcement) and (2) Forecaster 3’s emphasis on the multiple sequential steps required within ~45 days. I agree with their general direction. One important nuance for resolution is that a vague pledge or conditional timeline would not count—an authorized body must name a specific date. That makes the ‘symbolic announcement’ tail even thinner than F2/F3 imply.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~45 days. Status quo: martial law persists; elections are not conducted under martial law, and there’s been consistent messaging to defer national elections until after it ends. A No outcome follows from continued martial law and absence of legal/political moves to schedule. A Yes path would likely require: (1) at least a credible move to lift or imminently end martial law, and (2) the Verkhovna Rada (normally the body that sets the date) passing a resolution naming a specific election date—potentially for months later. There is little public signaling of either step in this short window. Forecaster 2’s scenario of external pressure producing a declarative announcement is conceivable, but the resolution criteria require a specific date from an authorized body, not a general intent; that further lowers the tail probability. Given the compressed timeline and multi‑step legal gating, I’m nudging my estimate slightly down. I still retain a small probability for a sudden ceasefire/armistice enabling a rapid legal/political pivot to announce a date before July 1.",
