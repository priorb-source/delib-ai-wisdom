    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (through June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discord targets a post–July 4 or fall window; it neither files a public S-1 nor posts a specific blog/news announcement before June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Discord publicly files an S-1 in mid-to-late June, or posts on its news/blog page that it has confidentially submitted a draft registration statement or otherwise explicitly states it is planning an IPO.",
    "rationale": "- State of play: As of May 23, 2025, there has been no public S-1 from Discord and no specific IPO announcement on its website. The provided background (Ars Technica) reports Discord is planning a 2025 IPO and has engaged JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, which supports that an active process is underway. My research assistant had no additional information, so I rely on this report plus general IPO timelines and base rates.\n- Timing dynamics: Companies typically make their public S-1 available 2–4 weeks before a roadshow/pricing. If Discord were targeting a late-June listing, a public S-1 in early-to-mid June would be plausible. However, many issuers prefer to avoid the July 4 holiday and often aim for a post–Labor Day window, which would push a public S-1 into late summer. Also, many tech companies use a confidential submission first; some announce that step, but many do not.\n- Resolution mechanics matter: A confidential submission alone would not count unless Discord posts a specific announcement on its news/blog. The most straightforward path to “Yes” is a public S-1 on EDGAR; the secondary path is a clear blog/news post that it is planning an IPO (e.g., announcing a confidential submission). Companies sometimes issue such announcements, but it’s not guaranteed.\n- Status quo weighting: With roughly five and a half weeks left and no public filing yet, and given the tendency to avoid the immediate July 4 period, the status quo favors “No.” At the same time, credible reporting of a 2025 IPO and bank mandates implies real momentum, keeping the chance of a June S-1 or a corporate announcement non-trivial.\n- Why not higher: Limited time left; typical avoidance of the early-July window; many issuers delay to September; no current public S-1. Why not lower: Clear signals of intent (bank mandates, 2025 target) and a feasible timeline for a mid-June S-1 or a blog announcement about a confidential submission.\n- What would move me up: Reputable reports (e.g., Bloomberg/WSJ) that Discord has confidentially submitted, hires for investor relations/governance typical of pre-IPO readiness, or any corporate blog/news language explicitly stating IPO plans. A sudden tech-IPO window strengthening could also raise odds. What would move me down: Reports of a delay to fall 2025 or 2026, adverse market conditions, or leadership/financial reporting changes suggesting a longer runway is needed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
