  "information": "As of May 15, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet listed the objective to 'Break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration' as 'In progress'. The moderators of the tracker have previously indicated that an item is moved to 'Complete' status only when a formal action, such as a signed executive order or an enacted statute, achieves the specific recommendation. For other large-scale restructurings, the tracker's status was changed to 'Complete' only after such a formal action was taken. From January through mid-May 2025, 5 of 41 objectives marked as 'In progress' on the tracker were updated to 'Complete'.\n\nOn May 8, 2025, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it would no longer be updating its Billion Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database. The official reason cited was 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes'. The database, active since 1980, had logged 403 events with an estimated cost exceeding $2.9 trillion. The discontinuation has been attributed to agency restructuring, budget cuts, and staff departures, including the lead scientist for the program. The administration also proposed a 25% reduction in NOAA's budget for fiscal year 2026.\n\nBreaking up a federal agency typically requires either legislation passed by Congress or an executive reorganization plan. Historically, similar executive reorganizations have taken between two and six months to progress from concept to a signed executive order, following legal and administrative vetting. For a legislative approach, while the House of Representatives could pass relevant language in an appropriations bill in June, Senate action would likely not occur until mid-July at the earliest. Past large-scale government reorganizations, such as the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, have been complex processes that take longer than a month and a half to formalize.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the item remains marked In progress on the tracker when checked on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No executive order or enacted statute that actually effectuates a breakup of NOAA is issued before July 1. There may be partial steps (program cancellations, budget proposals, internal reviews) and even House-only legislative language, but nothing that meets the tracker’s bar for a completed breakup; the spreadsheet stays In progress.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before July 1, the President signs an executive order (or Congress enacts legislation) that dissolves NOAA or redistributes its components in a way the tracker deems to have achieved the breakup. The tracker updates the item to Complete prior to July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: As of May 15, the tracker lists the NOAA breakup as In progress and, per the moderators’ stated practice, only moves items to Complete upon a formal action (e.g., a signed executive order or an enacted statute) that achieves the specific recommendation. Between January and mid‑May, only 5 of 41 In progress items moved to Complete. That base rate, along with the definition of completion, points to stickiness in the status quo over short windows.\n\nPath to completion: Breaking up a federal agency is a large, formal restructuring. The research notes that such actions typically require either legislation or an executive reorganization via EO, with executive vetting historically taking 2–6 months from concept to signature. On the legislative path, even if the House added relevant language in June, Senate action is unlikely before mid‑July. That timing falls outside the July 1 window, making a legislative completion before the deadline improbable.\n\nSignals of movement: Recent steps (ending the Billion‑Dollar Disasters database, proposed 25% budget cut, staff departures) are consistent with pressure on NOAA but do not by themselves meet the tracker’s completion threshold. They suggest intent but not imminent formal dissolution. The key swing factor is whether an EO ordering and effectuating a breakup is already near completion and could be signed in late June.\n\nWhy not higher: The action required is complex and legally fraught, the time window is short (~6 weeks), and the tracker sets a high bar for completion. The legislative calendar is unfavorable for enactment before July 1, and executive reorganizations typically need more lead time than remains unless already far along.\n\nWhy not lower: The administration has signaled an appetite for aggressive moves affecting NOAA, and the tracker appears to count signed EOs as completion even if implementation details follow. A late‑June EO explicitly dissolving or redistributing NOAA components could satisfy the tracker’s criterion regardless of subsequent litigation or delay.\n\nWhat would raise my forecast: Credible reporting or leaked drafts of an EO that explicitly breaks up NOAA; OMB/OPM/DOJ vetting reported as complete; WH scheduling chatter indicating an imminent reorganization announcement; tracker moderator clarification that a signed EO ordering the breakup will be marked Complete upon signature.\n\nWhat would lower my forecast: Public indications that any EO would be limited to a review or plan (not an effectuated breakup); Senate leaders signaling no action until after July 4 or later; tracker moderators reiterating they require enacted legislation for agency breakup; continued absence of leaks or preparatory signals by mid‑June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of May 15, 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet listed the objective to 'Break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration' as 'In progress'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
