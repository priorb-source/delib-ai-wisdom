  "information": "As of early June 2025, the U.S. total public debt outstanding is approximately $36.2 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury data cited by multiple news outlets. This figure was reported as having reached $36.216 trillion by January 2025. Estimates of the debt's growth rate vary; one source indicates it is increasing by approximately $1 trillion every 180 days, while another suggests a faster rate of over $1 trillion every 100 days. The debt has grown by more than $13 trillion since 2020.",

    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. Treasury continues its normal operations of issuing debt to finance government spending. The daily increase in the national debt remains consistent with the recent average rates of $5 billion to $10 billion per day. No major catastrophic event occurs that requires an immediate and massive unbudgeted fiscal outlay. Under this scenario, the debt would increase by approximately $150-$250 billion, reaching a total of roughly $36.4 trillion, well short of the $37 trillion threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unforeseen catastrophic 'black swan' event occurs, compelling the U.S. government to pass and fund an emergency spending package of nearly a trillion dollars in less than three weeks. This could be a sudden declaration of a major war, a series of devastating natural disasters on an unprecedented scale across the country, or a sudden financial collapse requiring an immediate, massive bailout of the entire financial system. This scenario would require an extraordinary and immediate acceleration of debt issuance.",
    "rationale": "As of early June 2025, the national debt stands at approximately $36.2 trillion. To reach the $37 trillion threshold by June 27, 2025, the debt would need to increase by approximately $800 billion in just 23 days. This would require an average daily increase of nearly $35 billion. Based on the provided research, the high-end estimate for the recent growth rate of the debt is $1 trillion every 100 days, which averages to $10 billion per day. The status quo, which forecasters should weigh heavily, suggests a much slower growth rate. Projecting forward using this high-end rate of $10 billion per day, the debt would only increase by an additional $230 billion over the next 23 days, bringing the total to approximately $36.43 trillion. This is a significant shortfall from the $37 trillion target. The required growth rate of $35 billion per day is 3.5 times higher than the observed high-end rate, making a 'Yes' outcome exceptionally unlikely within such a short timeframe. My forecast is not lower than 1% because an unforeseeable catastrophic event, while extremely improbable, cannot be ruled out entirely. My forecast is not higher because the 23-day timeframe is too short for even significant, planned policy changes to result in an $800 billion increase in debt issued; it would require a sudden, massive shock to the system. I would significantly increase my forecast if there were credible reports of an imminent, massive emergency spending bill being passed by Congress or a sudden, severe financial crisis unfolding.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US national debt be greater than $37 trillion on June 27, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBase rate information can be found at [Merchant Wholesalers, Except Manufacturers' Sales Branches and Offices: Durable Goods: Furniture and Home Furnishings Inventories/Sales Ratio](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/R4232IM163SCEN).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the value for Total Public Debt Outstanding at the Debt to the Penny chart at the US Treasury's [Debt to the Penny](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/debt-to-the-penny) tracker for June 27, 2025 is greater than or equal to $37,000,000,000,000.\n\nIf the resolution source does not report that specific date, then the resolution will be based on the amount corresponding with the first date after it.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early June 2025, the U.S. total public debt outstanding is approximately $36.2 trillion, according to U.S. Treasury data cited by multiple news outlets.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
