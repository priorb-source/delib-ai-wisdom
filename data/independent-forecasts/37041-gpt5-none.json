    "rationale": "The CDC Travel Health Notices (THN) page is for time-bound outbreak/advisory notices, distinct from routine destination vaccine recommendations. Historically, yellow fever THNs in the Americas have focused on South American countries (e.g., Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia) during outbreak periods. North American listings for yellow fever are rare. The PAHO alert (Mar 31, 2025) signals rising cases in the Americas, but the risk remains concentrated in South America. A North American notice would most likely stem from Trinidad and Tobago (which has had recent epizootic concern in past years) or Panama (ecological suitability in Darién), but confirmed human transmission prompting a CDC THN within the next five weeks is not the base case. I put extra weight on the status quo: absent clear signals of spread or epizootics with human risk in North America, no listing is most likely. Why not higher: short lead time, historically low base rate of NA yellow fever THNs, and no current strong indicators of NA outbreaks. Why not lower: the PAHO alert suggests elevated regional risk, and the ecological plausibility in a couple of NA countries means a nontrivial chance that CDC posts a Watch/Alert before June 1. Upward updates: credible reports of human cases or widespread nonhuman primate die-offs in Panama, Trinidad and Tobago, or other Caribbean/Central American countries; any CDC pre-alert mention or local MOH emergency vaccination campaigns signaling imminent advisory. Downward updates: continued confinement of cases to South America through mid-May and absence of NA epizootic reports.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country in North America is listed as having a travel advisory by the Centers for Disease Control at its [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices) page when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
