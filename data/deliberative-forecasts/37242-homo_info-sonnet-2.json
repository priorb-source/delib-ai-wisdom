    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises an important point I hadn't considered: airlines increased capacity 7-10% for spring 2025. This is a strong forward-looking indicator based on professional booking data and market analysis. Forecaster 3 introduces information about a power outage on April 28, but correctly notes it only affected the final 3 days with indirect 'knock-on effects' - this actually reinforces the case against decline rather than supporting it.\n\nBoth forecasters acknowledge the Easter timing advantage and Trump tariff concerns being minimal (US tourists are a small share), which aligns with my analysis. However, I believe both underweight the Easter timing factor. Easter 2025 (April 20) placed the entire Easter travel period in April, while Easter 2024 (March 31) meant most Easter travel occurred in late March 2024. For a major European tourism destination like the Canaries, this timing shift is enormous - easily worth several percentage points of growth.\n\nForecaster 3's 28% probability seems too high. If the only notable disruption was a 3-day indirect power outage, this makes decline less likely, not more. Forecaster 2's 20% is more reasonable but still conservative given the airline capacity increases and Easter advantage.\n\nThe airline capacity data Forecaster 2 cites is particularly significant - airlines don't commit to 7-10% capacity increases without strong forward booking data. This is industry validation of expected strong demand.",
    "rationale": "I'm lowering my forecast slightly from 12% to 10%. The new information actually strengthens the case against a decline:\n\n**Strong evidence against decline:**\n1. Q1 2025 showed 3.6% YoY growth with consistent monthly gains (Feb +2.2%, Mar +2.2%)\n2. Airlines increased capacity 7-10% for spring 2025 based on forward bookings\n3. Easter timing provides massive structural advantage - entire Easter period in April 2025 vs mostly late March 2024\n4. Power outage was minimal (only 3 days, indirect effects)\n5. Trump tariff concerns affect minimal US tourist share\n6. Status quo bias: YoY declines are rare without major disruptions\n\n**Weak evidence for decline:**\n1. General forecasting uncertainty\n2. Unknown April 2024 baseline strength\n\nThe combination of strong Q1 momentum, professional industry forecasting (airline capacity), and the Easter timing advantage creates a very high bar for a decline. The power outage affecting only 10% of the month with indirect impacts is insufficient to overcome 27 days of normal growth trajectory plus Easter boost. A 10% probability reflects appropriate forecasting humility while acknowledging the overwhelming evidence points to continued growth.",
