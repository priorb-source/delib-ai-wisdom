    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 57 days, from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - the current count stands at 295 UN staff fatalities as of April 30, 2025, which is 5 deaths below the 300 threshold needed for a YES resolution",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The conflict intensity significantly decreases or a sustainable ceasefire is reached in the coming weeks. Alternatively, the UN evacuates or substantially reduces its staff presence in Gaza, limiting exposure to danger. With improved security conditions or fewer personnel in harm's way, the additional 5 fatalities needed to reach 300 do not occur before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The conflict in Gaza continues at current or elevated intensity levels. UN staff remain deployed in humanitarian operations across dangerous areas of Gaza. Given that 295 deaths have already occurred, just 5 more fatalities over the next 57 days would be sufficient to reach the 300 threshold. This represents an average rate of less than 0.1 deaths per day, which appears feasible given the historical casualty rate.",
    "rationale": "The current situation places us remarkably close to the threshold - at 295 out of 300 deaths needed, or 98.3% of the target. With 57 days remaining, only 5 additional UN staff fatalities are required for a YES resolution. The fact that 295 UN staff have already been killed indicates an exceptionally dangerous operational environment and suggests ongoing conflict intensity. The rate required (5 deaths over ~2 months) is quite modest compared to what has already occurred. However, several factors introduce uncertainty: (1) Ceasefire negotiations could succeed, (2) UN might withdraw or reduce personnel for safety, (3) Conflict dynamics could shift significantly, (4) The posting pattern from OCHA could change. The status quo strongly favors reaching the threshold given the proximity - we would need active intervention (ceasefire, evacuation) or significant de-escalation to prevent 5 more deaths. My forecast is not higher (e.g., 85%+) because meaningful ceasefires or de-escalation remain possible in 2 months, and the UN could make operational changes to protect staff. It's not lower (e.g., 40%) because we're so close to the threshold that even modest continuation of current conditions would likely result in crossing it. I would revise upward if reports indicate continued or intensified conflict with UN operations ongoing, and downward if credible ceasefire agreements emerge or UN announces significant staff reductions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025. For example, a snapshot dated April 30, 2025, [reports](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-30-april-2025) 295 UN staff fatalities.\n\nIf OCHA stops posting new updates, this resolves as the most recent number, which as of the time of this question would be the impact snapshot posted on April 30, 2025.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
