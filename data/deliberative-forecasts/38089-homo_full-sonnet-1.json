    "review": "All three forecasts converge tightly in the 65-72% range, indicating strong agreement on the core dynamics. We all identify the same key factors: Sánchez's current 3-point lead (35% vs 32% as of May 8), the short one-month timeframe favoring stability, and the narrow but meaningful gap. Forecaster 3 makes a particularly valuable point I should have emphasized more: Morning Consult updates monthly, meaning only 1-2 data releases will occur before July 1 resolution. This significantly increases the weight of the most recent May 8 data showing Sánchez ahead. Forecaster 2 correctly highlights that both leaders being in the low 30s (weak support territory) creates volatility risk - approval ratings at these levels lack strong anchoring and could shift more easily than ratings in the 50s or 60s. However, I find this somewhat counterbalanced by the fact that both leaders appear to be in structurally weak positions, making dramatic asymmetric shifts less likely. The economic indicators mentioned (Turkey's consumer confidence gains vs Spain's recovery) seem to provide offsetting effects rather than clear directional pressure. Neither forecaster introduced evidence suggesting imminent events likely to flip the standings. The tight clustering of our forecasts suggests we've appropriately calibrated uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm maintaining a forecast very close to my original position. The deliberation confirms my core reasoning: the status quo strongly favors YES due to Sánchez's current lead and the short timeframe, but the narrow 3-point margin at low approval levels creates meaningful uncertainty. Forecaster 3's emphasis on limited upcoming data updates (only 1-2 before resolution) slightly strengthens the case for the status quo, as the May 8 snapshot showing Sánchez ahead will likely remain the most recent or second-most-recent data point at resolution. This pushes me marginally higher. However, Forecaster 2's point about volatility at approval ratings in the 30s is well-taken and prevents me from going above 72%. The convergence of all three analyses in the 65-72% range validates that this is the appropriate confidence band. I'm adjusting slightly upward to 71% to reflect the stronger weight of limited data updates, while acknowledging that a 3-point reversal within one month remains plausible enough to prevent higher confidence.",
