    "review": "My initial analysis and those of the other two forecasters all correctly identified the central conflict of this forecast: the inertia of the current drought versus the strong seasonal pressure of Florida's wet season onset. Our primary disagreement was in the weight assigned to each factor. I initially favored drought inertia, while the other two forecasters favored the seasonal shift. The most compelling argument raised by the other forecasters, which I had not sufficiently weighed, was the significance of the starting value being exactly 14.0 million. As Forecaster 3 pointed out, this means *any* net improvement in drought conditions affecting populated areas will result in a 'No' outcome. This lowers the bar for a 'No' resolution considerably. I found their arguments that the onset of the wet season is a powerful and reliable climatological force to be very convincing, especially when a large-scale reversal of the drought is not required, merely a marginal improvement.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am significantly updating my prediction. My initial forecast of 60% was based on the belief that the inertia of a severe drought would likely outweigh one month of seasonal rainfall. However, the other forecasters correctly highlighted two critical factors I had undervalued. First, the resolution threshold is set at the precise current level of 14.0 million residents. This makes the outcome extremely sensitive; any net reduction in the affected population, no matter how small, will result in a 'No'. Second, the June onset of Florida's rainy season is a very reliable and powerful climatological event. The probability of daily thunderstorms increases dramatically, which is highly effective at improving the short-term drought metrics that the Drought Monitor uses. Given the low bar for a 'No' resolution, betting on a powerful seasonal pattern to induce at least a marginal improvement seems more prudent than betting on the status quo holding perfectly for another month. Therefore, I am reversing my position. I am lowering my forecast by 20 percentage points, from 60% to 40%. This new forecast reflects my updated belief that a 'No' outcome is now more likely than a 'Yes', while still acknowledging a substantial 40% chance that the rains could be delayed, weak, or miss key population centers, causing the drought numbers to remain at or above the threshold.",
