  "information": "As of May 30, 2025, eight of the ten escapees have been recaptured. Some captures occurred out of state, including two inmates who were apprehended in Walker County, Texas, after a high-speed chase. The two fugitives still at large are Antoine Massey, 33, and Derrick Groves, 27, who are both considered armed and dangerous. Groves is a convicted murderer awaiting sentencing for a double homicide. Massey is described as a 'serial escapee' with three prior escapes from custody and was also being sought for kidnapping and rape. A former federal warden noted that Massey's housing in a first-floor cell was a significant security risk.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (from May 30, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - currently 2 inmates remain at large, so if they continue to evade capture, not all 10 will be recaptured by July 1",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The two remaining fugitives (Massey and Groves) continue evading capture through July 1. Given Massey's history as a 'serial escapee' with three prior escapes, he may have skills and experience in avoiding law enforcement. They could remain hidden with accomplices, move frequently across state lines, or flee to remote areas or potentially out of the country.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Law enforcement successfully locates and captures both Antoine Massey and Derrick Groves within the next 32 days through continued manhunt efforts, public tips, surveillance technology, traffic stops, or inter-state cooperation. The momentum from capturing 8 of 10 within two weeks continues, and increased public awareness leads to actionable information.",
    "rationale": "The key tension in this forecast is between the substantial time remaining (32 days - more than double the time it took to capture 80% of escapees) and the selection effect that makes the remaining fugitives likely the most difficult to apprehend. On the positive side: 8 of 10 were recaptured within approximately 14 days, demonstrating active and effective law enforcement pursuit. Cross-jurisdictional captures in Texas show coordination. There's substantial time remaining for investigation and pursuit. On the negative side: The two still at large have now evaded capture for 14 days, suggesting they may be more skilled or resourceful than the others. Critically, Antoine Massey is described as a 'serial escapee' with three prior escapes from custody, indicating proven ability to evade authorities. Both face extremely serious charges (murder, kidnapping, rape), providing strong motivation to remain at large. The question requires BOTH to be captured - not just one. Historical data on prison escapes shows that while most escapees are recaptured relatively quickly, those who remain at large longest often have the skills or circumstances that make them harder to catch. Massey's history is particularly concerning for the 'Yes' outcome. My forecast is not higher because Massey's track record and the selection effect are significant red flags. I'm not going lower because 32 days is genuinely substantial time, and law enforcement has shown effectiveness so far. I would update higher with news of credible sightings, tips, or one fugitive being captured. I would update lower if we reach mid-June with no significant progress or if evidence emerges they've fled internationally.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in the [2025 New Orleans jailbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Orleans_jailbreak) have been either recaptured or killed, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions). If any are still at large on July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of May 30, 2025, eight of the ten escapees have been recaptured. Some captures occurred out of state, including two inmates who were apprehended in Walker County, Texas, after a high-speed chase. The two fugitives still at large are Antoine Massey, 33, and Derrick Groves, 27, who are both considered armed and dangerous. Groves is a convicted murderer awaiting sentencing for a double homicide.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
