  "information": "Donald Trump has a history of attending high-profile sporting events. His recent UFC appearances include UFC 309 in November 2024 and UFC 314 on April 13, 2025. His attendance at UFC 314 was noted on his official public schedule. The time between UFC 314 in Miami and UFC 316 in Newark is less than two months. Some analyses of his past behavior suggest he rarely attends two UFC events in such close succession.\n\nUFC 316 is scheduled for June 7, 2025, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. The event's main fight is a bantamweight title rematch between Sean O'Malley and Merab Dvalishvili. Donald Trump and UFC President Dana White have a long-standing public friendship. In the past, Trump hosted early UFC events at his properties, including the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. White has publicly supported Trump, including an appearance at the 2024 National Republican Convention.\n\nAt UFC 314 in Miami on April 13, 2025, Donald Trump was seen with Dana White and Elon Musk. Reports also mentioned the presence of political figures such as Kash Patel, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Kristi Noem, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio. Trump was greeted by Shaquille O'Neal and Joe Rogan, and he entered the arena to the song 'American Bad Ass' by Kid Rock, receiving a positive reaction from the crowd.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until the evening of Saturday, June 7, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump spends the weekend at the White House or traveling for official duties (e.g., an international summit or domestic event), or security/logistics concerns lead the White House to pass on the appearance. No credible advance signals from Dana White or Trump’s team emerge, and he does not show up at the Prudential Center.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Given his relationship with Dana White and the easy logistics of Newark relative to Bedminster/NYC, Trump opts for a high-visibility drop-in. He pairs a New Jersey weekend with a brief arena appearance, getting on-camera with Dana White and UFC talent during the main card.",
    "rationale": "- Timing and base rates: The default for any specific UFC event is that Trump does not attend; even for him, appearances are episodic. That anchors the status quo toward No.\n- Recent behavior: He attended UFC 309 (Nov 2024) and UFC 314 (Apr 13, 2025) as President, showing willingness and capacity to appear at UFC events while in office. However, attending again less than two months after UFC 314 is somewhat uncommon per the assistant’s report, modestly pulling the probability down from even odds.\n- Location advantages: UFC 316 is in Newark, a short hop from locales Trump frequents (e.g., Bedminster). Lower travel friction and friendly optics with Dana White nudge the chance upward relative to a distant venue.\n- Event profile: A title rematch with a popular headliner (O’Malley) provides media value, but it’s not a once-in-a-decade mega-card. That helps, but doesn’t force attendance.\n- Political/media calculus: UFC appearances generate favorable crowd shots and broad coverage with minimal formal remarks. As President in 2025, he has already demonstrated he’ll do this (UFC 314), so it remains on the table. Countervailing risks include schedule conflicts (e.g., early-June international/diplomatic obligations) and security/operational complexity.\nWhy not higher: Most UFC events still pass without a presidential visit; recent attendance at 314 and possible early-June official travel create real conflict risk.\nWhy not lower: Strong Dana White relationship, tri-state proximity, and his pattern of leveraging UFC optics, especially since he already did so successfully in April, keep a nontrivial chance alive.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports or schedule hints (White teasing attendance, pooled press guidance, local law enforcement prep leaks, or Trump planning a Bedminster weekend). What would move me down: Firm reports of travel elsewhere that weekend (e.g., an overseas summit), health/security concerns, or a public schedule that clearly precludes an evening in Newark.",
