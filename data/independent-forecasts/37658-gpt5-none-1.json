    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the deal remains pending with no 8-K termination filed by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Regulatory reviews (notably CFIUS and any antitrust review) continue past July without a final block. The parties either already have an outside date later than July 1 or mutually agree to extend, keeping the agreement in force. Even if a regulator sues or signals concerns, the companies choose to litigate rather than abandon immediately.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A decisive adverse event occurs before July 1 leading to an 8-K termination: (a) CFIUS recommends blocking and the President issues or signals a formal prohibition, prompting termination; (b) the contractual outside date falls around late June and one or both parties refuse to extend; (c) an unexpected material adverse development or failure of a key consent (e.g., labor-related or national security mitigation) causes the parties to mutually terminate to avoid prolonged uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: This is a high-profile, politically sensitive, cross-border deal with known headwinds (union opposition, political scrutiny, CFIUS risk). However, in M&A, even contentious deals usually persist until a clear regulatory block, court loss, or a missed outside date. The specific resolution criterion requires an 8-K announcing termination/abandonment before July 1.\n- Time horizon: Only ~46 days remain. Unless a formal block or an imminent outside date forces a decision, deals typically continue rather than collapse on this short a timescale. That pushes weight toward the status quo (no termination filed by July 1).\n- Incentives: Both boards have strong incentives to keep the agreement alive while pursuing mitigation or litigation. Abandonment prior to a definitive government action is uncommon given the premium and the strategic rationale.\n- What could make Yes happen despite the short window: (1) A formal CFIUS/Presidential block before July 1; (2) an outside date at or near June 30 with no mutual extension; (3) a sudden, material adverse issue or an unresolvable condition (e.g., essential consent) becoming clearly unattainable.\n- Why not higher: The narrow window materially reduces the chance that all steps to a formal termination (including filing an 8-K) occur by July 1. Even strong negative signals or ongoing political opposition would not trigger resolution unless an actual termination is filed.\n- Why not lower: The merger is unusually politicized and faces national security scrutiny; a swift adverse government action or refusal to extend at an end-of-June outside date is plausible enough to keep tail risk nontrivial.\n- Update triggers upward: Credible reports of a CFIUS recommendation to block or White House intent to prohibit; an 8-K or press release indicating the outside date is June 30 without a clear path to extension; a DOJ or other regulator action paired with statements from either party suggesting abandonment rather than litigation.\n- Update triggers downward: Evidence of outside date well after July 1 or an executed extension; favorable signals from CFIUS or key stakeholders (e.g., labor); company disclosures reaffirming commitment to close and willingness to litigate if necessary.\n- Research assistant provided no new info; assessment relies on general M&A process dynamics and public context known up to late 2024.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Steel/Nippon Steel merger collapse before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_acquisition_of_U.S._Steel_by_Nippon_Steel)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, either U.S. Steel or Nippon Steel files an SEC Form 8-K announcing the merger agreement's termination or abandonment.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
