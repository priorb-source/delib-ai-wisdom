    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable insights I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2 emphasizes momentum following sentiment plunges and the persistence of underlying issues (tariffs, inflation), arguing for continued weakness (35%). Forecaster 3 counters with mean reversion after sharp drops, noting that crossing below 60 would require another sizable decline of 7+ points from an already-depressed level (78%). \n\nThe most valuable new information is the specificity around upcoming catalysts: the May CPI report on June 12 and jobs data will occur before the final June survey period. Forecaster 3's point about starting from 'mid-to-high 60s' and needing another large consecutive drop is particularly compelling. Historically, back-to-back large monthly declines are less common than partial rebounds.\n\nHowever, I find Forecaster 3's 78% somewhat optimistic given the explicit mention of a recent 'plunge' in the background material. Forecaster 2's momentum argument has merit - when sentiment drops sharply due to structural concerns (tariffs, inflation), the issues don't resolve immediately. That said, Forecaster 2's 35% seems too pessimistic given the historical rarity of extended sub-60 readings and the significant further decline required.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast upward modestly to 70%. The key factors:\n\n1. **Baseline level matters**: If May puts us in the mid-to-high 60s, reaching ≤60 requires another 7+ point drop, which is substantial.\n\n2. **Mean reversion edge**: Forecaster 3's argument about the lower frequency of consecutive large drops is statistically sound. After a plunge, partial recovery is more common than continued steep decline.\n\n3. **Upcoming catalysts**: The June 12 CPI report is critical. Unless it shows unexpectedly hot inflation, it's more likely to stabilize than further crater sentiment.\n\n4. **Historical context**: Sub-60 readings are genuinely rare, occurring mainly during severe crises (2008, 2022 inflation peak). Current conditions, while challenging, don't clearly meet that threshold.\n\n5. **Risk acknowledgment**: The 30% downside risk accounts for: potential hot CPI print, escalating tariff concerns, market selloff, rising gas prices, or June preliminary readings in the low 60s.\n\nI'm not moving all the way to 78% because the recent plunge signal should not be dismissed - it indicates genuine stress that could persist. But 70% better reflects the asymmetry: maintaining above 60 from mid-60s is more probable than another large drop below 60.",
