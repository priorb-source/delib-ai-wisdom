  "information": "Across Africa, 47 of the 54 signatory nations had ratified the AfCFTA agreement as of July 2024. However, overall implementation of the trade area since its 2021 launch has been described as sluggish. According to trade policy analysts, key impediments include production-related challenges like low industrial output, poor infrastructure, and non-tariff barriers. The original goal of removing tariffs on 90% of goods has been pushed back to 2034.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "25 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Sudan has not ratified AfCFTA and there is no indication of imminent ratification",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sudan continues without taking action due to ongoing political instability and civil conflict that has disrupted governance since April 2023. The ratification process, which typically requires legislative approval and executive action, cannot be completed in the remaining 25 days. The deadline passes without ratification.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sudan's government, recognizing the economic benefits and regional pressure, expedites an emergency ratification process. Despite ongoing internal challenges, key stakeholders push through legislative and executive approvals in an unprecedented timeframe, completing ratification before July 1st.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. With only 25 days remaining, the timeframe is extremely compressed for a formal ratification process. Sudan faces severe governance challenges due to ongoing civil conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and Rapid Support Forces since April 2023, making legislative and executive action difficult. While my research assistant notes Sudan has developed and validated a draft implementation strategy, this is merely preparatory work - actual ratification is a separate, formal process requiring legislative approval and executive sign-off. The fact that 47 of 54 nations had ratified by July 2024 while Sudan had not suggests it has been slower to act than most African peers. There is no evidence in the available information of imminent ratification or recent momentum toward this goal. The forecast is not lower (closer to 0%) because technically rapid action remains possible - some governments can move quickly with emergency procedures when sufficiently motivated by economic or political pressures. The forecast is not higher because there is simply no evidence of such action being planned or underway, and the timeline is prohibitively short given Sudan's current situation. I would revise upward only with concrete evidence of active ratification proceedings or official government announcements of imminent action. I would revise downward with confirmation that no such plans exist or further governance deterioration.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAcross Africa, 47 of the 54 signatory nations had ratified the AfCFTA agreement as of July 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
