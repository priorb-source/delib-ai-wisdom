    "review": "The other forecasters make several compelling arguments I should weigh more heavily. First, they emphasize more strongly that the legal constraints of the program being statutory may explain why Trump is pursuing legislative (SAFE Act) rather than executive solutions - this is a sophisticated point about strategic choice, not just legal limitation. Second, both note the terminology issue: if Trump hasn't used the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' in 62 executive orders over 4+ months, this suggests he may prefer alternative terminology like 'visa lottery program,' which wouldn't satisfy the resolution criteria even if he took action. Third, Forecaster 3's point about Trump's legal team understanding authority limits and focusing on clearer areas is well-taken - the administration has been strategic about where to use executive power. The convergence around 18-20% from two independent forecasters using similar reasoning also provides useful information. However, I'm not convinced I should go quite that low because: (1) 42 days is still meaningful time, (2) Trump could issue a memorandum supporting the SAFE Act that uses the phrase, (3) his unpredictability and symbolic actions are real factors, and (4) my original analysis already incorporated the strong status quo pattern.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find their arguments about legal constraints and terminology particularly compelling. The fact that Trump has issued 62 executive orders on immigration without once using 'Diversity Visa' is an even stronger signal than I initially weighted - it suggests either strategic avoidance of the phrase or a preference for legislative solutions. The legal team sophistication argument is also persuasive: they've focused executive action on areas with clearer authority. However, I maintain some upward pressure on the forecast because: (1) Trump has demonstrated willingness to issue symbolic or legally questionable orders (birthright citizenship), (2) a presidential memorandum supporting the SAFE Act could mention the program using the exact phrase, (3) 42 days provides meaningful opportunity, and (4) recent events (lottery results, upcoming application period) could serve as catalysts. The terminology issue cuts both ways - while it might prevent counting, it also means any action specifically targeting the program would likely use the formal name. I'm updating downward to reflect the stronger legal constraint and terminology arguments, but not to the full extent of 18-20% given remaining uncertainty factors.",
