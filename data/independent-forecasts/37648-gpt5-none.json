    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No: no signed or jointly announced US–Iran nuclear agreement by the deadline; at most quiet, informal understandings continue without being labeled an agreement.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Backchannel talks via Oman/others continue, but both sides avoid a public, jointly framed “agreement.” The US (especially under a more hawkish administration) prefers tacit de-escalation and targeted waivers; Iran seeks meaningful sanctions relief that Washington won’t publicly grant amid regional tensions and domestic politics. Any steps are kept deniable or described as “understandings,” which do not meet the question’s bar.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A limited, quickly assembled freeze-for-freeze package is publicly announced: Iran caps or rolls back enrichment and expands IAEA monitoring; the US issues limited sanctions waivers or unfreezes funds. Both sides—perhaps via an IAEA/Oman-facilitated announcement—explicitly describe it as an agreement concerning Iran’s nuclear program, de-escalating after recent regional tensions.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the default is inertia. Historically, US–Iran nuclear arrangements take months of shuttle diplomacy and are often kept informal to avoid domestic political costs and INARA-triggered congressional review. The question requires that the US and Iran “sign or announce an agreement” about the nuclear program; semantic caution (calling steps “understandings” rather than an “agreement”) has been common and would not satisfy resolution criteria. Regional context and domestic politics also weigh against a rapid, public deal. If the current US administration is more hardline, the public branding of any arrangement as a “deal” is especially unlikely before July 1. On the Iranian side, while economic incentives and a more pragmatic presidency can favor engagement, ultimate authority rests with the Supreme Leader and the IRGC’s equities, making swift, public concessions improbable without substantial, durable relief. There are no fresh, credible signals (per the research assistant: no additional information) of an imminent, text-based, jointly announced deal; recent history has featured tacit de-escalation instead. Why not higher: limited time, need for explicit “agreement” language, likely INARA complications, and ongoing regional frictions. Why not lower: both sides have incentives to avoid nuclear crisis; a narrow, temporary, and explicitly labeled agreement is conceivable if tied to IAEA monitoring steps and limited sanctions waivers to stabilize the region. What would move me up: credible reports of a draft text; IAEA Director General travel paired with joint statements; US issuance of time-bound oil/export waivers tied to nuclear steps; congressional notifications under INARA; coordinated Oman/Qatar mediation signals of an imminent announcement. What would move me down: IAEA censure without a remedial plan; fresh regional escalations; categorical denials from senior officials; new US sanctions coupled with statements ruling out talks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States and Iran announce a new nuclear deal before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nIsraeli media (Hebrew): [Senior ministers were informed: There is a high chance that the US and Iran will reach an agreement](https://www.kan.org.il/content/kan-news/politic/895178/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the US and Iran sign or announce an agreement with respect to Iran's nuclear program.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
