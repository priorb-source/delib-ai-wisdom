    "review": "All three forecasts converged remarkably at 33-35%, suggesting strong agreement on the fundamental dynamics. Forecaster 3 provides the most detailed analysis, particularly regarding geography (Northampton town as Labour's strongest area vs rural/suburban splits) and an important correction that the Wellingborough by-election was in North Northamptonshire, not West, which slightly reduces the weight of that evidence. Both forecasters emphasize Reform UK's vote-splitting effect as critical, which I agree with. Forecaster 3 makes an excellent point I underweighted: Reform's national polling may not translate locally if they lack full candidate slates or effective ground game. This is a crucial uncertainty. The geographic analysis is particularly valuable - if Labour dominates Northampton town while Lib Dems and Reform split Conservative votes in rural areas, the path to Conservative defeat becomes clearer. However, I still find the FPTP dynamics and opposition fragmentation (Labour vs Lib Dem vs Greens) potentially favorable to Conservatives retaining plurality status even with reduced seat totals. The starting position of 50/93 seats provides significant cushion.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I maintain my forecast at 35%. The convergence of all three forecasts within 2 percentage points validates the core reasoning. The additional geographic detail from Forecaster 3 is valuable and highlights real risks in Northampton town for Conservatives, but doesn't fundamentally alter the probability calculation. The key uncertainties remain: (1) Reform UK's actual candidate coverage and ground game quality in West Northamptonshire specifically, and (2) whether opposition vote fragmentation helps or hurts Conservatives more than Reform vote-splitting hurts them. I weight the Conservative starting position and FPTP advantages slightly more than Forecaster 3, particularly given that with only 76 seats total, winning plurality in a fragmented field requires fewer seats than in the previous 93-seat council. The national polling showing a near three-way tie suggests no party will dominate, increasing the likelihood that Conservatives' incumbency advantages in specific wards allow them to squeak through with most seats despite losing overall vote share.",
