    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26 days (from June 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Casey DeSantis has not announced her candidacy as of June 5, 2025, and if this status quo continues, the question resolves as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis continues to deliberate or ultimately decides against running for Florida governor, either due to unfavorable polling, Trump's endorsement of Byron Donalds, or strategic reasons to delay any announcement until after July 1, 2025. She may also decide to pursue other political opportunities or remain in her current role.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis announces her gubernatorial candidacy within the next 26 days, possibly to establish herself early in the race despite challenging polling numbers, to counter Byron Donalds' momentum with Trump's backing, or because her campaign infrastructure and strategy are ready to launch.",
    "rationale": "The key evidence is that as of early May 2025 (referenced article), Casey DeSantis had not announced despite being discussed as a potential candidate. Now in early June, 26 days remain until the resolution date, and still no announcement has been made. The status quo strongly suggests No. Major gubernatorial candidacy announcements typically require substantial preparation, organization, and strategic timing. The fact that no announcement has occurred despite a month of speculation is significant. Additionally, the polling shows her trailing Byron Donalds who has Trump's endorsement, which may discourage or delay her entry. However, I cannot assign extremely low probability because: (1) 26 days is a meaningful timeframe where political announcements do happen, (2) she has clearly been considering the race given the polling, and (3) political dynamics can shift rapidly. My forecast is not higher because the status quo bias is strong - if she were planning to announce by July 1, we would likely see more signals by now such as campaign infrastructure building, staffing announcements, or scheduled events. The unfavorable political environment (Trump backing a rival, trailing in polls) also weighs against announcement. My forecast is not lower because political surprises occur, and announcement timing can be strategic - she could still decide to launch in late June to maximize impact. I would update higher if: campaign staff announcements emerge, a major announcement event is scheduled, or polling improves. I would update lower if: more days pass without movement, she makes statements suggesting she won't run, or she endorses another candidate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Casey DeSantis announce her candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Poll: Trump's endorsement boosts Byron Donalds over Casey DeSantis for Florida governor](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/05/09/poll-byron-donalds-surges-past-casey-desantis-with-trump-backing/83412367007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Casey DeSantis announces her candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
