    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1.5 months (≈45 days) until June 28, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes (Milei 61% vs Sheinbaum 60% per background)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheinbaum holds near ~60% while Milei dips a point or two (e.g., to 59%), or their displayed approvals round to a tie, which resolves No. Possible drivers: Argentine protests or legislative setbacks, a negative economic headline (inflation blip, currency wobble), or simply week-to-week noise plus rounding.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milei maintains or widens a slim edge (e.g., 61–63%) while Sheinbaum drifts to 58–60%. Possible drivers: continued Argentine disinflation and fiscal wins, passage of key reforms, or favorable headlines; meanwhile, Sheinbaum experiences mild early-term softening or controversy that trims a couple of points.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and inertia: The latest stated figures have Milei at 61% and Sheinbaum at 60%. With only ~6 weeks left and Morning Consult’s leader approvals typically moving slowly (often 0–2 points week-to-week), the status quo slightly favors Milei. I place extra weight on this since most weeks don’t see large swings.\n- Measurement/rounding risk: Morning Consult displays whole-number approvals. With a 1-point gap, week-to-week noise or rounding can easily produce a tie, which resolves as No. That tie risk pulls the probability closer to 50 than the raw status-quo edge would suggest.\n- Volatility and fundamentals: Milei’s approval has been more volatile historically than a typical early-term Mexican president. However, by mid-2025 Argentina’s macro narrative could plausibly be improving (notably disinflation and fiscal consolidation), supporting a small uptick or steadiness. Sheinbaum, early in her term, is likely to remain high but could drift slightly as the honeymoon fades or as contentious reforms are debated. Net effect: narrow, slightly positive tilt for Milei, but not by much.\n- Timing uncertainty: The resolution occurs when checked on or after June 28, 2025, so the specific weekly snapshot matters. This adds noise and again keeps the forecast near even.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information provided, so I’m leaning on general approval dynamics and the provided baseline numbers.\nWhy not higher? The 1-point lead is within normal weekly variation, and a tie counts as No. Sheinbaum’s approvals are likely sticky in the high-50s/low-60s, making a Milei edge far from assured.\nWhy not lower? The status quo already has Milei ahead, and approvals are sticky. Improving Argentine macro headlines provide a plausible path for Milei to hold or add a point.\nWhat would move me up? Successive Morning Consult updates showing Milei’s lead widening (≥2–3 points), clear Argentine reform wins, or visible softening in Sheinbaum’s numbers.\nWhat would move me down? A Morning Consult update showing parity or Sheinbaum ahead, Argentine economic or political turbulence, or a strong positive event for Sheinbaum that boosts her back into the mid-60s.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Javier Milei have a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, Sheinbaum is at 60% as compared with Milei at 61%.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Javier Milei has a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum at [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. A tie or a lead by Sheinbaum resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
