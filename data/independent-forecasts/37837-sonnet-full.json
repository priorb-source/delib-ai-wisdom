  "information": "Historical data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) shows the following counts of reported sightings for the month of June: 357 in 2019, 470 in 2020, 407 in 2021, and 603 in 2022. While specific numbers for June 2023 and June 2024 were not provided in the source material, data tables indicated that all reported months in 2023 exceeded 600 reports and all reported months in 2024 exceeded 450 reports. For the current year, a data scrape on May 22, 2025, showed a total of 2,067 sighting reports for January through April 2025, yielding a monthly average of approximately 517. Each of ahe first four months of 2025 individually exceeded 400 reports.\n\nBetween May 2023 and June 2024, the US government documented 757 reports of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), with 708 of them occurring in the air. Of these, only 49 cases were officially closed. A notable number of these sightings occurred near the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly in Arizona. Media reports have covered recent military-related incidents, including a US Air Force F-16 fighter jet that was struck and damaged by an object over Arizona in January 2023. In a separate event from September 2024, a US Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with an object traveling at Mach 2 during a mission in California.\n\nPublic interest in UFO-related topics is supported by ongoing events and media attention. The 11th annual 'Contact in the Desert' conference, a major gathering for UFO experts and enthusiasts, is scheduled to run from May 29 to June 2, 2025, in California. Regionally, Washington state ranks third in the U.S. for the total number of UFO reports submitted to NUFORC, and several sightings have been reported from the state's Columbia Basin region since the beginning of 2025. The topic of UAPs also continues to receive attention from mainstream news outlets and the U.S. Congress.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks. June 2025 will end on June 30, and the question resolves based on data accessed on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the number will exceed 400",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 experiences an unexpected drop in reporting to 400 or fewer sightings due to technical issues with NUFORC's reporting system, a change in how reports are counted or displayed, or an anomalous decline in public reporting behavior that breaks from the established 2025 pattern.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Reporting patterns continue as they have throughout 2025, with June recording more than 400 sightings. This maintains the trend where every month in 2025 has exceeded 400 reports, with a monthly average of approximately 517 sightings. Public interest remains steady, supported by events like the Contact in the Desert conference and ongoing media attention to UAP topics.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors exceeding 400 reports for June 2025. Historical data shows June has exceeded 400 in three of the last four years (2020: 470, 2021: 407, 2022: 603), with only 2019 falling short at 357. More significantly, all reported months in 2023 exceeded 600 reports, all months in 2024 exceeded 450 reports, and critically, every single month in 2025 so far (January through April) has exceeded 400 reports with an average of 517. This represents a clear and consistent upward trend. The status quo strongly suggests continuation of this pattern - the world changes slowly, and absent evidence of a disruption, monthly reporting should remain consistent with recent months. Factors supporting continued high reporting include ongoing government attention to UAPs, media coverage, scheduled events like the Contact in the Desert conference in late May/early June, and established public interest patterns. My forecast is not higher (toward 95%+) because there remains inherent uncertainty in human reporting behavior, potential technical or administrative changes at NUFORC that weren't announced, and the possibility of seasonal variation we haven't fully captured. My forecast is not lower because the 2025 data is remarkably consistent - four consecutive months all exceeding the threshold with significant margin - and there's no evidence suggesting a pattern break. I would update higher if May 2025 data (available soon) shows continued strong reporting above 450-500. I would update lower only if there were concrete evidence of methodology changes, technical issues at NUFORC, or an unexpected early June data point showing dramatically reduced reporting.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of UFO sightings reported by the National UFO Reporting Center exceed 400 for June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts greater than 400 UFO/UAP sighting reports at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) for the month of June 2025, as displayed when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) shows the following counts of reported sightings for the month of June: 357 in 2019, 470 in 2020, 407 in 2021, and 603 in 2022.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
