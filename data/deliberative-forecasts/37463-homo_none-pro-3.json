    "review": "The other two forecasters provide analyses that are substantively identical to my own. We all correctly identify the primary evidence: Berkshire Hathaway's multi-year history of holding its Amazon stake at exactly 10,000,000 shares. This establishes a powerful base rate of inaction, making 'No' the most likely outcome. We also all agree that the probability is not zero, as the position is actively managed and a small purchase is always a possibility. The only difference is in the final probability, with both other forecasters at 10% while I am at 5%. They do not present new evidence or arguments I hadn't considered that would compel me to increase my forecast. In fact, Forecaster 2 raises a point about Amazon's strong stock performance potentially pushing its valuation beyond Berkshire's comfort zone for new purchases, which I find convincing and actually provides further support for a lower probability of a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am maintaining my forecast. My reasoning remains anchored to the extremely strong status quo. Berkshire Hathaway has not altered this specific stock position in over 20 consecutive quarters, creating a powerful historical precedent for inaction. A change in this pattern would be a notable event, and there is no information or catalyst to suggest Q1 2025 was the quarter for such a change. The other forecasters' arguments for a 10% probability seem to give slightly more weight to the general possibility of portfolio adjustments than I believe is warranted by the specific history of this holding. Forecaster 2's point about a potentially high valuation for Amazon following a strong market run further reinforces the case against Berkshire adding to its position, as they are value-oriented investors. A 5% probability correctly reflects that a purchase is a possible but very low-probability event, a 1-in-20 chance, which feels appropriate for breaking a five-year-plus pattern of holding steady.",
