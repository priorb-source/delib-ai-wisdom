  "information": "According to a list of National League batting leaders published on May 18, 2025, Freddie Freeman of the Los Angeles Dodgers was leading with a .375 average. Other top hitters included Will Smith (Los Angeles Dodgers) at .336, Brendan Donovan (St. Louis Cardinals) at .330, and Manny Machado (San Diego Padres) at .323. In the American League, David Alonso of the New York Mets had a team-high batting average of .308 as of May 17. In Triple-A, Chicago Cubs prospect Matt Shaw was reported to be hitting .400 over his last eight games.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "13 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The league's top hitters, including Freddie Freeman, continue to perform at a high level, but their batting averages remain below .400 as the sample size of at-bats grows and slight regression occurs.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A top hitter, most likely the current league leader Freddie Freeman (.375), goes on an exceptional hot streak over the final 13 days of May, hitting around .500 in that period to lift their overall season average to the .400 mark.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the current state of the MLB batting races and the historical difficulty of achieving a .400 batting average. As of mid-May, the highest average is Freddie Freeman's .375. Closing the 25-point gap to .400 in just 13 days is a formidable challenge, requiring a player to hit at an extremely high, likely unsustainable, pace (e.g., .500) for roughly a dozen games. While not impossible, it is a very low-probability event. Typically, as the season progresses, batting averages regress toward established norms, making it harder to maintain such a high mark. The status quo, with no player currently hitting .400, is the strongest predictor. The forecast is not lower than 5% because an elite hitter is capable of an exceptional two-week hot streak. The forecast is not higher because of the significant statistical leap required in a short period against major league pitching. I would raise my probability if Freeman or another hitter had several multi-hit games in the coming week, and lower it if their averages dip even slightly.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if on June 1, 2025, any Major League Baseball player in the 2025 regular season has a batting average of greater than or equal to .400 according to the [ESPN baseball stats page](https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to a list of National League batting leaders published on May 18, 2025, Freddie Freeman of the Los Angeles Dodgers was leading with a .375 average. Other top hitters included Will Smith (Los Angeles Dodgers) at .336, Brendan Donovan (St. Louis Cardinals) at .330, and Manny Machado (San Diego Padres) at .323.

In Triple-A, Chicago Cubs prospect Matt Shaw was reported to be hitting .400 over his last eight games.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
