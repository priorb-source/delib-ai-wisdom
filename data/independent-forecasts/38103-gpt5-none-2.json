    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month (until on/after July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — as of March 12, 2025 the page explicitly says Tesla products are not eligible for BC Hydro/CleanBC rebates",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BC Hydro keeps the underlying exclusion but removes the explicit Tesla mention from the specified page (e.g., switches to generic language like “preference for Canadian goods” or relies solely on an eligible-products list). Alternatively, they reverse course and re-allow Tesla before July.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The specified BC Hydro page continues to explicitly state that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV home charger rebate in July 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Recency and policy intent: The BC government and BC Hydro announced, effective Mar 12, 2025, a preference for Canadian goods and an exclusion of U.S.-produced goods “where practicable,” explicitly naming Tesla as ineligible. This appears aligned with provincial industrial-policy goals and is unlikely to be reversed within a few weeks.\n- Short time horizon: Only about a month remains, and government program wording typically persists for months, especially when there are transitional clauses (e.g., honoring pre-approvals before Mar 12). Keeping an explicit warning helps avoid customer confusion, making continued explicit mention plausible.\n- Key resolution nuance: The question resolves Yes only if the specified page itself still says Tesla products are ineligible. Even if the policy persists, BC Hydro could remove the explicit brand reference and rely on a general statement or an eligible-products list. That creates a non-trivial chance of a No outcome despite ongoing exclusion.\n- Likely paths: (a) Policy unchanged and explicit Tesla mention remains (most likely); (b) Policy unchanged but explicit mention removed or moved elsewhere (moderate risk); (c) Policy reversed (low probability in the near term).\n- Why not higher: There is meaningful risk (roughly 20%) that communications are normalized by July—removing the Tesla callout while keeping the exclusion in practice—and a small chance of a policy tweak.\n- Why not lower: The direction of travel is clear and recent, with political backing. Rapid reversal seems unlikely within weeks.\n- What would shift me upward: Evidence the page is keeping explicit brand callouts in other areas; statements confirming long-lasting exclusions and branding on that very page.\n- What would shift me downward: Site refreshes that replace brand-specific language with generic eligibility rules or a move of the Tesla note to another page; indications of legal/political pushback causing softening of the stance.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information available beyond the quoted policy; thus I weight the status quo and typical government web-update cadence more heavily.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill BC Hydro still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates. If you purchased or have received pre-approval for your Tesla product before March 12, 2025, it can still qualify for rebates and will be processed as normal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if BC Hydro at [this page](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebates-home-chargers.html) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, says that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program. If it does not mention Tesla being ineligible, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
