    "review": "Both forecasters raised critical evidence I had underweighted or missed entirely. Forecaster 3's point about the Easter calendar shift is particularly compelling - Easter 2025 fell entirely in April while Easter 2024 was in late March. This structural advantage alone creates a significant boost to April 2025 arrivals independent of other factors. The fact that March 2025 still showed 2.2% YoY growth despite lacking Easter support strongly indicates robust underlying demand. Forecaster 2's evidence about airlines increasing capacity 7-10% (Jet2.com, Vueling, Air Nostrum) is also significant - airlines base these costly decisions on sophisticated demand forecasting and wouldn't expand if anticipating decline. The Q1 2025 data showing 3.6% growth provides additional confirmation of strong performance trajectory. Combined, this evidence suggests the baseline expectation should be much more strongly weighted toward No (growth) than my initial analysis indicated. The April 28 power outage, while real, affected only 2-3 days and represents roughly 344/6000 flights (5.7%) on one day - this disruption appears insufficient to overcome the Easter boost and underlying growth momentum.",
    "rationale": "Re-examining my original forecast in light of the Easter calendar shift fundamentally changes the analysis. The Easter timing difference is a known, predictable structural factor that heavily favors April 2025. Combined with Q1 2025 growth of 3.6%, March 2025 growth of 2.2% without Easter, airline capacity increases of 7-10%, and the limited temporal scope of the power outage (last 2-3 days of month), the evidence strongly points toward April 2025 exceeding April 2024. The power outage disruption, affecting perhaps 1-2% of monthly volume even with knock-on effects, appears insufficient to counter the Easter boost which could easily add 5-10% to monthly totals. I'm maintaining slightly higher probability than Forecaster 3's 15% because we still lack complete April data and there remains some possibility of unreported disruptions or weaker demand in the first three weeks of April. However, the convergence of multiple positive indicators - calendar advantage, proven Q1 performance, airline confidence, and limited disruption scope - warrants a significant downward revision from my initial 28%.",
