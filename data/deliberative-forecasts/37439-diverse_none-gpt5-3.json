    "review": "Forecaster 2’s core premise treats Trump as a private citizen/candidate and invokes the Logan Act; that’s not applicable in May 2025, when he is President. That mis-specification materially biases their estimate downward. They also treat dual-acknowledgment as a major hurdle; for head-of-state calls, readouts from both sides are common, so I don’t see that as a large additional barrier. Their attention to domestic optics is valid but likely over-weighted.\n\nForecaster 3’s framing (active channel established in Feb 2025, narrow 34-day window, standard triggers like Ukraine/prisoner swaps) is broadly aligned with my prior. However, 40% seems high without concrete indicators; typical leader-call cadence (a few per year) implies a monthly hazard closer to 25–35% absent a known catalyst. I agree with their update triggers (reports of planned talks, prisoner-swap activity, crisis signaling).",
    "rationale": "I anchor on call-frequency base rates for active-but-adversarial leader relationships: roughly 3–5 calls/year yields a 24–37% chance over a 34-day span under a Poisson-like hazard. The February 2025 call confirms the line is open and both sides will acknowledge, nudging the probability toward the middle of that band. Domestic optics and the option to operate via envoys temper the odds; absent a specific catalyst (prisoner swap, ceasefire push, sudden escalation) it’s hard to justify the high end of the range. The requirement that both sides acknowledge is not a large discount for presidential calls. With no fresh reporting of planned leader contact in the target window, I keep a conservative mid-range estimate.\n\nI would raise the forecast on credible reporting of imminent leader-level talks, prisoner-swap negotiations reaching a decision point, or public signals from either side about speaking soon. I would lower it if the White House emphasizes channeling all Russia business through deputies or if there’s explicit signaling against direct contact in this period.",
