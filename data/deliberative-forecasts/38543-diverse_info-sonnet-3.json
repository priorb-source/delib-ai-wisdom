    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 raised important context I initially lacked: the June 11 announcement where Trump and China discussed a visit agreement, and the tariff deadline around July 8-9 creating potential urgency. Forecaster 2's 20% seems excessively optimistic - the 'details to be announced later' language actually reinforces planning gaps, not progress. We're now 4 days past that announcement with no concrete follow-up, which is telling. Forecaster 3's 8% is more defensible and introduces valuable points: (1) alternatives exist to an in-China visit (virtual approval, Washington meeting, neutral ground); (2) Trump tends to host rather than travel; (3) Hong Kong/Macau could technically count as 'China' with less protocol requirements. However, even Forecaster 3's analysis doesn't fully account for the complete absence of any preparation signals - no advance teams, no press pool guidance, no Chinese MFA ceremony announcements. The June 11 announcement showed high-level interest but the lack of follow-through despite an approaching deadline suggests significant obstacles remain. The tariff urgency point is important but doesn't necessitate physical travel to China when other diplomatic options exist.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating slightly upward from my initial 2% to account for the June 11 announcement context that demonstrates confirmed high-level discussions about a visit. This is genuine new information that marginally increases plausibility. However, I remain closer to my original forecast than to either colleague's for several reasons: (1) We're now June 15, four days past the June 11 announcement, with zero concrete follow-up on the promised 'details to be announced later' - this delay is diagnostic of planning difficulties; (2) The complete absence of any logistical preparation signals (advance teams, security preparations, press guidance) remains decisive with only 15 days remaining; (3) As Forecaster 3 correctly notes, the tariff deadline creates incentives for engagement but numerous alternatives exist that don't require Trump physically visiting China; (4) Trump's confirmed G7 (June 16-18) and NATO (June 24-25) commitments consume 9 of the remaining 15 days, severely constraining the window. The Hong Kong/Macau edge case is interesting but would still require some advance preparation that hasn't materialized. My updated forecast of 4% acknowledges the June 11 discussions while maintaining that the logistical and temporal constraints make this outcome highly unlikely.",
