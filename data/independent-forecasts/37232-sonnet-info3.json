  "information": "The company is in a flight hiatus, with no crewed flights scheduled until 2026. The next generation of spaceplanes, the Delta SpaceShip, began assembly in March 2025. Commercial flights for this new craft are planned to begin in mid-2026, with private astronaut flights following in the fall of 2026. According to a regulatory filing, Geode Capital Management LLC increased its stake in Virgin Galactic by 19.1% during the fourth quarter of 2024.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known on June 1, 2025, which is approximately 33 days from today (April 29, 2025). We have 2 days until May begins, then the full 31 days of May to observe whether any posts appear.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - Virgin Galactic will fail to make new posts in May 2025. The current pattern shows very infrequent posting, with only 2 posts in approximately 4.5 months (January 30 and December 12, 2024). The company is in a flight hiatus with no operational news, making continued silence the most likely continuation of the status quo.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic posts at least once in May 2025. This could occur if they announce Q1 2025 earnings results (typically due in early May for public companies), provide an update on Delta SpaceShip assembly progress, announce corporate developments such as partnerships or leadership changes, or disclose other material information required for a publicly traded company. Earnings announcements in particular could break the silence.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic makes no posts in May 2025, continuing their established pattern of sparse communications during the flight hiatus. With no immediate operational milestones (commercial flights aren't until mid-2026) and the company in a development phase, they continue to maintain minimal public communications on their News page, only posting when absolutely necessary or when major milestones occur.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a YES outcome. Virgin Galactic's posting frequency has been extremely low: only 2 posts in about 4.5 months, with the most recent being 89 days ago (January 30, 2025). This pattern of 1.5-3 months between posts reflects a company in operational hiatus with limited newsworthy developments. The research assistant confirms the company has no crewed flights until 2026 and is in the early assembly phase of Delta SpaceShip (began March 2025), with commercial operations not starting until mid-2026. This suggests minimal operational news to announce. However, I cannot assign an extremely high probability (90%+) for several reasons: (1) As a publicly traded company, Virgin Galactic likely needs to report Q1 2025 earnings in early May, which could appear on their News page; (2) Three months since the last post is within their normal range, and they might provide a development update; (3) Unexpected corporate news (financing, partnerships, regulatory developments) could occur; (4) The Geode Capital stake increase suggests continued investor interest that might warrant communication. Why not lower: The historical pattern is clear and compelling - very sparse posting during this hiatus period. The company has demonstrated they're comfortable with multi-month gaps. The burden of proof is on a change from this established pattern. I would update higher (toward YES) if I learned that Q1 earnings would definitely not be posted to the News page or that the company had announced a formal communication hiatus. I would update lower (toward NO) if I found evidence of scheduled corporate events in May or learned that quarterly earnings are routinely posted to this News page. Given the strong status quo bias toward infrequent posting, tempered by the possibility of quarterly reporting or unexpected announcements, my forecast is 70% probability of YES.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe company is in a flight hiatus, with no crewed flights scheduled until 2026. The next generation of spaceplanes, the Delta SpaceShip, began assembly in March 2025. Commercial flights for this new craft are planned to begin in mid-2026, with private astronaut flights following in the fall of 2026.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
