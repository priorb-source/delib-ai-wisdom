    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (through the close on Fri, May 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (if the S&P 500 closes in May exactly where it closed in April, the criterion “higher than” is not met)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Hotter-than-expected May CPI/PCE and a hawkish tone at the early-May FOMC push rate-cut expectations out; mega-cap earnings/guidance disappoint or leadership cracks, credit spreads widen, and risk-off into month-end drives the index below its April close.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Earnings/guidance from large caps remain resilient, breadth holds up, inflation data come in benign, and the Fed sounds patient—not tighter—so risk appetite and buybacks support a modest month-end level above April’s close.",
    "rationale": "Base rates: Across all months historically, the S&P 500 closes higher about 60% of the time; May specifically is closer to the mid-50s. That sets a natural baseline around 55–60%. Over a one-month horizon, large regime shifts are uncommon, so I put extra weight on these base rates. Catalysts in May: (1) FOMC early in the month; (2) CPI/PPI mid-month; (3) continued Q1 earnings and guidance; (4) PCE inflation near month-end. These are two-sided but, absent a shock, tend to net out to modestly positive drift supported by ongoing buybacks post-earnings blackouts and resilient earnings. Countervailing risks include elevated valuations that make the index sensitive to any inflation upside surprise or guidance cuts, and the final trading day potentially coinciding with a key data release, which can amplify downside risk right at resolution. Seasonality (“sell in May”) is a mild headwind, not an outright negative in probability terms. With no additional research inputs provided by the assistant, I lean on historical frequencies and known event risk timing. Why not higher: May’s seasonality, event clustering (FOMC/CPI/PCE) and valuation sensitivity limit confidence in a positive month. Why not lower: Persistent post-2023 uptrend, typical earnings beat rates, and corporate buybacks support odds modestly above 50%. What would move me up: Broad-based earnings beats with strong guidance, cooler-than-expected CPI/PCE, and a clearly patient/dovish Fed. What would move me down: Hot inflation prints, a hawkish Fed surprise, widening credit spreads, or notable earnings/guidance disappointments from index heavyweights.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the S&P 500 index go up in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Times: [What Is a Bear Market? Are We in One?](https://www.nytimes.com/article/bear-market-stocks-tariffs.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the closing value of the S&P 500 Index on the final trading day of May 2025 is higher than that of the final trading day of April 2025.\n\nThe \"close\" values shown on the [history page of Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC) will be used.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
