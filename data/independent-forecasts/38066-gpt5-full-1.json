  "information": "Y Combinator (YC) is launching its inaugural AI Startup School in San Francisco on June 16-17, 2025. The event is a free conference intended for 2,000 top AI students, researchers, and recent graduates, with YC offering up to $500 for travel expenses. The program's goal is to shape the next generation of AI startups by focusing on entrepreneurship, product building, and fundraising. YC has announced that Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the event's headline speakers.\n\nSam Altman and Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 as a non-profit foundation, with Musk providing significant initial funding. Musk left the organization in 2018 citing disagreements with Altman and the company's direction. After OpenAI was re-launched as a for-profit entity, Musk filed a lawsuit alleging a violation of the original non-profit principles. Their public rivalry has also included a hostile, unsolicited $97.4 billion takeover bid for OpenAI led by Musk, which Altman publicly dismissed, and reported competition for influence over U.S. government AI projects.\n\nIn May 2025, news reports indicated that Sam Altman had made conciliatory gestures towards Elon Musk. Altman reportedly wrote to Musk proposing a collaboration on the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) and extended an 'olive branch.' While Musk had not publicly responded to the written offer, reports mentioned that informal contacts had occurred between the technical teams of their respective organizations. Separately, Altman publicly posted on social media to Musk, stating, 'AGI is too important, can't let petty grudges get in the way.'",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 22 days (until 12:00 am PDT, June 18, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Both appear at YC AI Startup School but in separate keynotes/fireside chats, with staggered schedules and no joint panel; or one cancels last-minute (most likely Musk) due to travel or PR concerns.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "YC schedules a joint fireside chat or closing panel featuring both; or one makes a surprise walk-on during the other’s session for a brief exchange, photo, or Q&A—clearly on the same stage at the same time.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: When conferences announce multiple headline speakers who are public rivals, joint on-stage appearances are uncommon unless explicitly billed in advance. As of May 27, there is no agenda or public signal of a joint session. The status quo therefore favors separate stages.\n\nIncentives pushing Yes: YC would reap enormous publicity from a joint appearance. Both figures are confirmed headliners, and the attendee profile (2,000 top AI students/recent grads) is valuable to both OpenAI and xAI/Tesla recruiting. The research assistant notes Altman’s recent conciliatory posture toward Musk (“olive branch”) and informal cross-team contacts, which modestly increase chances of a symbolic rapprochement or a curated joint dialogue.\n\nIncentives pushing No: The Altman–Musk relationship remains adversarial (history of lawsuit/hostile actions). Musk typically prefers environments he controls (e.g., X Spaces) and often avoids giving stage to rivals; he also has a track record of schedule volatility and last‑minute changes. Legal/PR teams on either side may view a joint stage as risky. Without a pre-announced joint session, logistics/security usually prevent spontaneous co-appearances.\n\nWhy not higher: No explicit joint session announced; rivalry and optics/controls issues remain significant; Musk’s attendance risk is non-trivial. These keep the likelihood well below even odds.\n\nWhy not lower: Both are confirmed headliners at the same two-day event; a joint segment would be a huge draw and aligns with YC’s publicity incentives. Recent conciliatory signals from Altman and informal contacts slightly raise the chance above a minimal base rate for rivals sharing a stage.\n\nWhat would raise my forecast: Publication of an agenda listing a joint panel/fireside; public hints from Garry Tan/YC or either principal about appearing together; reports of a pre-event meeting or détente; Musk confirming firm travel plans to SF and engaging positively with YC or Altman on X.\n\nWhat would lower my forecast: Agenda release showing only separate sessions; renewed public sparring or legal escalation; credible reports of security/contractual constraints forbidding a joint appearance; signs that Musk will attend remotely or skip; YC signaling tightly scripted, non-overlapping formats.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nY Combinator (YC) is launching its inaugural AI Startup School in San Francisco on June 16-17, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
