  "information": "European powers have demanded a 30-day ceasefire from Russia, starting May 12, warning of new sanctions if the demand was ignored. Donald Trump advised Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept talks with Vladimir Putin without the precondition of a ceasefire. Conversely, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine's readiness for talks was contingent on Russia agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire and providing for its effective monitoring.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "33 days (from May 13, 2025 to June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - without active diplomatic engagement requiring direct communication, the default outcome is that such a phone call does not occur",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Diplomatic negotiations regarding the ceasefire proceed through intermediaries, backchannel communications, or involving other world leaders. Trump and Zelenskyy maintain their divergent positions without direct engagement, or any communications between them occur through advisors and are not publicly acknowledged by both parties.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The urgent diplomacy surrounding the 30-day ceasefire demand necessitates direct communication between Trump and Zelenskyy to coordinate their positions or attempt to bridge their differences. Given Trump's advisory role and the high stakes of the situation, they schedule a phone call to discuss Ukraine's negotiating position, and both sides publicly acknowledge the conversation afterward.",
    "rationale": "The current diplomatic context is highly active and consequential. A 30-day ceasefire has been demanded starting May 12, creating an urgent timeline that overlaps almost perfectly with the question's resolution period. Trump is demonstrably involved, having already advised Zelenskyy on negotiations, though their positions diverge (Trump wants talks without preconditions; Zelenskyy requires a ceasefire first). This disagreement, combined with the urgency and high stakes, increases the likelihood of direct engagement. Historical precedent shows they have communicated by phone before. However, several factors moderate this probability: (1) Status quo bias - most diplomatic work proceeds through intermediaries rather than direct leader calls; (2) The relationship has known complications (referenced in the Sky News article); (3) The requirement that both sides must acknowledge the call adds a hurdle; (4) Even in crises, the base rate of specific leader-to-leader phone calls on any given day remains relatively low. Over a 33-day period during active diplomacy, a phone call is plausible but not certain. The forecast would increase if we saw reports of planned talks or deteriorating situations requiring immediate coordination. It would decrease if we saw evidence of completely frozen relations or if all negotiations clearly shifted to other mediators.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News: [Key moments that have shaped Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-zelenskyys-relationship-from-perfect-phone-call-to-oval-office-clash-13331892)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nEuropean powers have demanded a 30-day ceasefire from Russia, starting May 12, warning of new sanctions if the demand was ignored. Donald Trump advised Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept talks with Vladimir Putin without the precondition of a ceasefire. Conversely, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine's readiness for talks was contingent on Russia agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire and providing for its effective monitoring.\n\nToday is 2025-05-13.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
