    "review": "Both forecasters largely corroborate my prior view: Brazil’s host-level caution (“stabilise where it is”), unanimity hurdles, and the failed April FM communiqué collectively make a July invitation unlikely. They add two useful nuances: (1) the ‘no leaks/no shortlist’ meta-signal with five weeks left, which suggests low odds of a surprise; and (2) the guest list (Mexico, Uruguay, Colombia) signaling outreach without commitment, with Mexico particularly unlikely to seek membership due to US sensitivities. I find these arguments incrementally persuasive. No materially new contrary evidence was presented to push the probability up.",
    "rationale": "Time is short, unanimity is required, and Brazil appears to prefer consolidation over rapid enlargement. The partner framework offers a low-cost way to keep suitors engaged, reducing pressure for full invitations now. The April failure to issue a joint communiqué indicates intra-bloc frictions that could spill into expansion decisions. The absence of credible leaks about a consensus candidate this close to the summit further lowers near-term odds. A Yes path still exists—China/Russia could push one relatively uncontroversial partner (e.g., Malaysia/Thailand/Nigeria) as a single addition to sustain momentum—but this would likely require a visible rhetorical shift from Brazil or credible pre-summit reporting, neither of which is evident. Given these factors, I nudge my estimate slightly down to reflect the ‘no-leaks’ and host-agenda points while preserving a nontrivial tail for a late political deal.",
