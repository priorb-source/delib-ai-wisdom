  "information": "Donald Trump has a history of attending high-profile sporting events. His recent UFC appearances include UFC 309 in November 2024 and UFC 314 on April 13, 2025. His attendance at UFC 314 was noted on his official public schedule. The time between UFC 314 in Miami and UFC 316 in Newark is less than two months. Some analyses of his past behavior suggest he rarely attends two UFC events in such close succession.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Donald Trump does not attend UFC 316. While he is a frequent guest at UFC events, the short two-month interval since his last attendance at UFC 314, combined with a demanding presidential schedule, makes his attendance at this specific event less likely than his baseline average.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "President Trump has other pressing commitments related to his administration or campaign activities scheduled for the weekend of June 7. Given his recent attendance at a UFC event in April, his team decides against another similar public appearance so soon, adhering to his past pattern of spacing out such events.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The UFC 316 event in Newark, New Jersey, is geographically convenient for President Trump, being close to his Bedminster club. He views the event as a valuable and low-effort opportunity to connect with his supporter base in the region and decides to attend, fitting it into his schedule despite the short turnaround from the previous UFC event.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is slightly in favor of attendance. Donald Trump has a well-established history of attending high-profile UFC events, which serve as popular public relations opportunities. The research notes his recent appearances at UFC 309 in November 2024 and UFC 314 in April 2025, indicating a current trend of utilizing these events for public outreach. The key factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the location of UFC 316 in Newark, New Jersey, which is very close to his residence in Bedminster, making the logistical effort minimal. This convenience could easily override the main counterargument, which is the short time since his last attendance. The research assistant's note that he 'rarely attends two UFC events in such close succession' is the primary reason this forecast is not higher; this historical pattern suggests that back-to-back appearances are not his default. Therefore, the probability is set at 55%, reflecting a slight edge towards attendance due to the convenience factor, but acknowledging the significant uncertainty posed by his scheduling patterns and presidential duties. I would increase my forecast if reports confirmed a light schedule for him that weekend or if a fighter he particularly favors was announced as the main event. I would decrease it if any significant, conflicting presidential or political duties were scheduled for that date.",
