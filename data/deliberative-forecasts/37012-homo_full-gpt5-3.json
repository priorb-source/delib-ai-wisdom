    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my initial take: Conservatives face strong national headwinds and Reform-driven vote splits but retain structural advantages in rural wards and from opposition fragmentation. New/useful emphasis I hadn’t foregrounded: (1) the Liberal Democrats’ very low local base constrains their near-term ceiling despite targeting; (2) the likelihood that boundary changes, coming after a 2021 Conservative landslide, typically blunt the incumbent’s advantage and may weight more toward Northampton town; (3) candidate coverage as a pivotal uncertainty, especially for Reform in rural wards. I find their reasoning balanced and consistent with typical local-election dynamics (multi-member FPTP inefficiencies for Reform; concentrated Labour gains in Northampton; possible Lib Dem/Green fragmentation). The arguments push in opposite directions: LD low base slightly boosts Conservative plurality odds; boundary reweighting toward Northampton and leadership turnover slightly reduce them. Net effect: offsets rather than a directional shift.",
    "rationale": "I continue to see Conservatives as slight underdogs to finish with the most seats. Factors lowering their chances: severe national climate, Reform’s squeeze on right-leaning votes, leadership change, and the possibility that new boundaries amplify Northampton’s weight where Labour is strong. Factors supporting them: efficient rural geography, incumbency/name recognition at ward level, and opposition fragmentation—especially if Reform’s candidate coverage/ground game is patchy and Lib Dems can’t convert targeting into many seats from a low base. With no fresh ward-level data or candidate-slate specifics, the added arguments from other forecasters largely offset. I’m holding my estimate, acknowledging a wide uncertainty band and expecting no overall control with a close race for largest party.",
