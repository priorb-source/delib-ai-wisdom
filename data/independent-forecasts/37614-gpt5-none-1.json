    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 days (election May 20, 2025; results likely same day or within 1–2 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "He remains in office (incumbent retains seat unless a recall majority removes him)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Motivated opposition turns out in a low-turnout special election; media coverage of the shooting allegation keeps salience high; petition signers and their networks dominate the electorate, producing a majority to recall him.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He persuades enough voters the shooting was self-defense or overblown (e.g., no charges), secures local endorsements, and benefits from incumbency/name recognition; broader, less-engaged voters return mail ballots against the recall, yielding a majority to keep him.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: In special local recall elections, the side with more motivated voters often has an edge. The fact the recall qualified indicates substantial local opposition in a very small electorate (Mountain View is tiny), which raises removal risk. However, incumbents in local offices still often survive recalls, especially if there are no criminal charges and they can frame events in their favor.\n- Signal content: The highlighted allegation (shooting a teen in the face) is highly negative and likely to be salient. In a small-town race decided by tens to a few hundred votes, this could sway enough voters for removal. Countervailing factors include potential self-defense narratives, lack of charges (if applicable), and personal relationships in a small community, which can blunt scandal effects.\n- Base rates and balance: Among local officials who make it to a recall ballot, removal rates are roughly around coin-flip territory, often slightly favoring removal in contentious cases. Given the severity of the allegation and the low-turnout, opposition-energizing dynamics, I lean modestly toward removal. But without evidence of charges, high-profile condemnations, or clear polling/ballot return data, a decisive lean is not justified.\n- Why not higher (i.e., >50% retain): The scandal’s severity and the recall’s qualification suggest significant mobilized opposition; special elections tend to advantage motivated recall proponents.\n- Why not lower (i.e., <30% retain): Incumbency, possible self-defense/no-charge context, and small-town networks can sustain enough support to defeat a recall; absent fresh damaging revelations, outright removal is not a lock.\n- Updates that would move the forecast: Downward if new damaging facts, criminal charges, or strong public condemnations emerge; if early ballot return data show outsized participation from petition-signing precincts/networks. Upward if endorsements from trusted local figures, fundraising/ground game advantages for Metz, or ballot returns indicate broader-than-expected turnout beyond the opposition core.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information available, so this relies on base rates, the salience of the allegation, and typical recall dynamics.",
