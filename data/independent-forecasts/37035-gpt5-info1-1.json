  "information": "Colombia has declared a national health and economic emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, reports indicate 79 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since September 2024, with a case fatality rate cited as approximately 45-50%. The government has ordered a mass vaccination campaign and requires travelers to high-risk areas, and those arriving from certain countries like Brazil and Ecuador, to present a yellow fever vaccination card. The Ministry of Health has identified over 400 municipalities as being at 'high' or 'very high' risk.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — CDC keeps Colombia at Level 2 through June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Yellow fever transmission remains geographically limited with modest case counts; Colombia’s vaccination campaign expands; no sustained urban transmission or major international exportations occur; CDC continues recommending vaccination and mosquito precautions without elevating to Level 3.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp uptick in cases including sustained urban transmission (e.g., Bogotá/Medellín/Cali), clear healthcare strain or vaccine shortages, and/or notable international spread prompts CDC to issue a Level 3 (“Avoid nonessential travel”) notice for Colombia before June 1.",
    "rationale": "Interpreting the resolution criterion as “greater than 2 (i.e., Level 3 or higher) on or after June 1, 2025.” Current status is Level 2. CDC historically reserves Level 3 for severe, hard-to-mitigate traveler risk (e.g., large Ebola outbreaks). For vaccine-preventable diseases like yellow fever, CDC typically maintains Level 2 and emphasizes vaccination and bite avoidance, even during substantial outbreaks (e.g., Brazil 2016–2018; Angola 2016). The research assistant notes 79 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since Sep 2024, high CFR (typical for severe YF) but small absolute numbers, plus a national vaccination push and requirements for vaccination proof for high‑risk areas/arrivals. Over 400 municipalities are labeled high/very high risk by the Ministry, but with an effective vaccine and targeted measures, CDC escalation to Level 3 for the entire country within ~5.5 weeks seems unlikely. Why not higher? Level 3 for yellow fever would be unusual absent explosive, urban transmission or systemic breakdowns that negate vaccination as a mitigation. The short time window further lowers odds. Why not lower? The national emergency, wide geographic risk mapping, and the potential for rapid changes (e.g., urban cycles, vaccine supply issues, exported cases) mean a non‑trivial tail risk remains. Upward update triggers: rapid case acceleration with sustained urban transmission; reports of vaccine supply constraints or poor campaign uptake; WHO/ECDC/US Embassy markedly escalating warnings; CDC issuing Level 3 YF notices for other countries as a precedent. Downward update triggers: stabilizing/declining incidence; evidence of robust vaccine coverage in high‑risk zones; CDC updates reaffirming Level 2 guidance.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Travel Health Notice status of Colombia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/colombia), which is \"Level 2 Practice Enhanced Precautions\" at the time of this question, is a level of greater than 2 when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nColombia has declared a national health and economic emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, reports indicate 79 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since September 2024, with a case fatality rate cited as approximately 45-50%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
