  "information": "Several key opposition figures face eligibility challenges ahead of the 2025 election. In late April 2025, a court ruled that potential challenger Tidjane Thiam, leader of the PDCI party, was ineligible to run for president due to his French nationality. Former President Laurent Gbagbo was excluded from electoral lists in 2023 following a conviction for embezzlement. Another political figure, Guillaume Soro, remains in exile and is ineligible due to a 2021 conviction; in April 2025, a trial began for his former aide-de-camp for an alleged coup attempt against Ouattara.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — he does not declare his candidacy before June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ouattara continues to defer any formal announcement while RHDP manages internal positioning and waits for the official campaign calendar. He either intends to run but plans a later unveiling (e.g., mid/late summer, closer to filing deadlines), or he ultimately backs a successor without ever declaring by June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "RHDP convenes a May congress or major rally that formally designates Ouattara as its standard-bearer, and he publicly accepts the nomination. Alternatively, he opts to project stability amid opposition disarray and announces early to lock in elite cohesion and donor confidence.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the base rate favors later announcements in Côte d’Ivoire. In 2020, Ouattara declared in August, and West African incumbents often time declarations closer to filing deadlines. There is no visible deadline pressure forcing a May decision. The status quo is therefore that he does not announce by June 1.\n\nThe research assistant notes the opposition is weakened: a late-April ruling deemed Tidjane Thiam ineligible; Laurent Gbagbo remains off electoral lists; Guillaume Soro is in exile and legally constrained. This reduces Ouattara’s incentive to rush. With the contest tilted toward RHDP, he can maximize intra-party leverage by preserving ambiguity into the summer, then either declare or anoint a successor once internal alignments are settled and the formal calendar opens.\n\nWhy not higher: Absent a publicly scheduled RHDP congress or explicit signals from Ouattara, early May declarations are less common; his 2020 precedent and typical regional timing point to later announcements. If he intends to run, he still gains by waiting; if he does not, a successor reveal could also come later than June 1.\n\nWhy not lower: A May party conclave could materialize to lock in the ticket; he might also choose an earlier declaration to preempt factional jockeying, capitalize on opposition setbacks, or project continuity amid security concerns in the north. Any credible reporting of a planned RHDP congress or senior RHDP figures signaling that Ouattara will be the candidate in May would push this forecast higher. Conversely, strong indications that he is preparing to elevate a successor (e.g., leaks about a designated heir, cabinet reshuffles positioning a successor) would lower it.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Alassane Ouattara declare his candidacy for president of Ivory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire) before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAfrica Center for Strategic Studies: [Côte d’Ivoire: Efforts to Forge Resiliency Face Stiff Test](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/2025-elections/cotedivoire/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
