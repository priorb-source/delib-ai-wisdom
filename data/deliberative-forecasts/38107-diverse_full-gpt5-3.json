    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my prior reasoning: strong First Amendment protections (post-Counterman subjective intent), ambiguous speech, absence of concrete prosecutorial signals, very short timeline, and extremely low base rates for arresting a former FBI director. They also correctly discount low-credibility claims of “imminent” charges. New value: they emphasize the stepwise process (investigation → charging decision/indictment or complaint → warrant → arrest) being hard to compress into ~1 month for a constitutionally fraught case. They lean slightly higher (4%) on tail risk from political pressure and the fact that any arrest for any reason would resolve Yes. I find their logic sound but not materially new; the main difference is calibration on tail risk.",
    "rationale": "My prior 2% reflected: (1) no public indicators of charging momentum (no complaints, warrants, subpoenas, grand jury movement); (2) high legal bar on threats; (3) institutional caution given unprecedented optics; and (4) very low base rate for unrelated arrests for someone like Comey. The deliberation reinforces those points. I’ll modestly adjust upward to 3% to acknowledge (a) two independent assessments placing more weight on political/expressive tail risk, and (b) the possibility of a swift complaint-and-arrest approach if authorities chose to act despite legal hurdles. Triggers to move up: credible reporting of a criminal complaint or sealed filing, a grand jury convened on this matter, issuance of a warrant/subpoena, or new explicit statements by Comey that reduce First Amendment protection. Triggers to move down: official indication the inquiry is closed or two more weeks with no escalatory signals.",
