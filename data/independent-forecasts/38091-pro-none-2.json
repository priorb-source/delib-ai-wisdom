    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be determined by July 1, 2025, approximately one month from now.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo is that while diplomatic outreach continues, a signing ceremony with a new country is not scheduled or executed within the specific 30-day window of June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations with one or more potential signatories continue, but the internal governmental approval processes and the scheduling of a formal signing ceremony extend beyond June 30, 2025. For example, a country might be ready to sign but waits for a more opportune diplomatic moment in July or later.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The diplomatic momentum from the recent signings by Bangladesh (April 2025) and Norway (May 2025) continues, and the U.S. State Department hosts a signing ceremony for another country in June 2025. This new signatory could be a nation that has been in discussions for some time and has just completed its domestic ratification process.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the recent and historical rate of new signatories to the Artemis Accords. There are currently 55 signatories. The program has seen a steady, and recently accelerating, pace of new members. Over the last ~17 months (since the end of 2023), 14 countries have joined, an average rate of approximately 0.82 per month. More recently, there have been signings in both April 2025 (Bangladesh) and May 2025 (Norway), indicating strong current momentum. A simple model assuming a signing rate of one country per month suggests a probability of over 60% that at least one signing event occurs in any given month. The diplomatic push by the United States to establish the Accords as the international standard for lunar exploration is a strong continuous driver. My probability is not higher because diplomatic announcements are discrete events and their timing can be 'lumpy'. A signing could easily be scheduled for the last week of May or the first week of July, just outside the resolution window, for reasons of administrative convenience or political timing. There is no specific publicly available information pointing to a pre-scheduled signing in June. My probability is not lower because the consistent rate of new signatories over the past two years, and especially the last two months, makes it more likely than not that this trend will continue. The status quo is not static; it is one of active growth. For me to increase my forecast, I would look for announcements of high-level diplomatic meetings in Washington with non-signatory nations or credible news reports that a specific country is in the final stage of approval. To decrease my forecast, I would look for major geopolitical events that could divert the diplomatic attention of the U.S. State Department or key potential signatories.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025. There are 55 signatories at the time of this question: Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay.

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country becomes an Artemis Accord signatory after May 30, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
