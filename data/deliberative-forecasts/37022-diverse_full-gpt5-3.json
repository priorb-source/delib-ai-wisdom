    "review": "Both forecasters make a strong case that March had identifiable positive drivers: (1) a confirmed IMF disbursement (~16B UAH), (2) FX valuation from a 0.7% UAH depreciation (~9–11B UAH), and (3) ongoing domestic borrowing activity. They argue these sum to ~51–53B UAH and thus comfortably clear the ~30–31B UAH hurdle even without the EU €1B tranche. I agree IMF + FX likely add ~25–27B UAH. Where I’m less convinced is treating the ~26B UAH from domestic auctions as a net addition; that figure is typically gross issuance, and principal redemptions can materially offset it. The reference to “modest” debt servicing costs is encouraging but ambiguous (could refer mainly to interest); without a clear view of March maturities, I hesitate to bank the full 26B as net. Still, their framing highlights that IMF + FX already get us close to the threshold, so only a small positive net domestic contribution (or an EU disbursement late in the month) would be needed—this nudges me upward from my prior estimate. I also share their caution on timing/series conventions (Trading Economics publication and whether EU funds hit in March).",
    "rationale": "Starting from 1.869T UAH in February, the hurdle is ~30.5–31B UAH. Known March positives: IMF (~16B UAH) + FX valuation (~9–11B UAH) ≈ 25–27B UAH. That leaves a small gap of ~4–6B UAH to clear the threshold, which could plausibly be met by net domestic issuance in a month characterized as having ‘modest’ debt servicing. If the EU €1B posted in late March, it would almost ensure a Yes; if it slipped to April, the outcome is closer but still leans Yes given how small the remaining gap is. Historical context (7 of the prior 12 months ≥ +30B UAH) further supports odds above even. I do not go as high as 90% because (i) the 26B UAH domestic figure is likely gross, not net, and principal repayments could reduce or negate it; (ii) uncertainty about the exact booking date of the EU tranche; and (iii) possible nuances in the Trading Economics series timing. I’m updating up from 70% to 80% on the strength of IMF + FX likely putting March within a few billion of the threshold and the reasonable chance that net domestic flows or the EU tranche push it over.",
