  "information": "Erbil International Airport has undertaken developments to enhance its operational capabilities. The airport has commenced preliminary tests for night flights after receiving clearance for night landings, as part of a strategic plan to improve air communication systems and safety. In January 2025, a committee from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) visited the airport to conduct an inspection for its inclusion in the official list of international airports. This inclusion is expected to facilitate an increase in the number of international flights. The airport's operational capacity was also demonstrated during the Hajj season, with the Iraqi Ministry of Transportation successfully operating numerous pilgrim flights from Erbil and other Iraqi airports.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The number of destinations from Erbil fluctuates seasonally but is currently hovering around the threshold of 31. Without new routes being added, the number is not expected to exceed 31.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite airport upgrades, airlines delay launching new routes due to prolonged regulatory processes, commercial planning cycles, or a cautious outlook on regional stability. The summer season sees no net increase in destinations, and the count remains at 31 or below on July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the successful ICAO inspection in January 2025 and the introduction of night flights, Erbil International Airport's enhanced status and operational capacity attract new carriers. At least one or two airlines commence new routes for the peak summer season, pushing the total number of direct destinations above 31.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant positive developments at Erbil International Airport (EBL) weighed against the typical inertia of the aviation industry. The status quo is finely balanced near the threshold of 31 destinations, but recent events strongly favor an increase. The two key drivers supporting a 'Yes' outcome are the clearance for night flights and the ICAO inspection for official international listing. These are not trivial improvements; they are fundamental upgrades that increase airport capacity, safety, and international standing, making EBL a more attractive destination for airlines. Given these upgrades occurred in early 2025, there has been a reasonable window for airlines to plan and launch new routes for the summer 2025 season, which is when the question resolves. The threshold for a 'Yes' outcome is low—only a net increase of one or two destinations is required. The combination of major airport upgrades and the peak travel season makes this a likely outcome. \n\nMy forecast is not higher than 70% because establishing new air routes involves significant lead time and is subject to external factors. Airlines may be cautious due to regional geopolitical tensions or economic headwinds, delaying their expansion plans beyond the July 1 deadline. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 70% because the catalysts for growth are substantial and concrete. It would be unusual for such significant operational and regulatory improvements at an airport not to result in at least a minor network expansion within a six-month period, especially heading into the summer peak. \n\nI would increase my probability with official announcements from airlines of new routes starting before July 1. I would decrease it upon news of regional instability impacting air travel or the suspension of existing routes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 31 direct flight destinations from Erbil, Iraq on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nShafaq News: [Kurdistan Summer 2025: A Promising Season](https://shafaq.com/en/Kurdistan/Kurdistan-Summer-2025-A-Promising-Season)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 31 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Erbil (EBL)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/EBL) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nErbil International Airport has undertaken developments to enhance its operational capabilities.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
