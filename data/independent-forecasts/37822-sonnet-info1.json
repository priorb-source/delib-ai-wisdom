  "information": "In late April 2025, during a series of town hall meetings, Beto O'Rourke stated that he would consider running for the U.S. Senate if it aligns with the desires of Texas voters. Quoted in multiple outlets such as Fox News, The Hill, and Yahoo, he said, 'If it comes to pass that this is what the people of Texas want, that it's the highest and best use of what I can give to you, then yes, I will.' As of late May 2025, O'Rourke had not filed any formal candidacy papers with the FEC and no campaign infrastructure or exploratory committee was visible. He continues his work with the voter mobilization organization 'Powered by People,' which he founded in 2019.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "40 days (question resolves July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement - the question resolves as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beto O'Rourke continues making conditional statements about running but delays any formal decision-making past July 1, 2025. He may be waiting for more polling data, potential primary opponents to emerge or decline, or clearer signals about fundraising viability. His cautious 'if' language suggests he's still in exploratory mode rather than committed to running, and 40 days proves insufficient for him to make this major decision.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Within the next 5-6 weeks, O'Rourke receives encouraging polling showing a viable path to victory, secures commitments from major Democratic donors, or gets strong encouragement from party leadership. He concludes that the timing is right and makes a formal announcement of his Senate candidacy, possibly framing it as responding to grassroots demand from Texas voters.",
    "rationale": "The status quo heavily favors a No resolution. As of late May 2025, O'Rourke has made only conditional statements about running, with no FEC filing, no campaign infrastructure, and no exploratory committee visible. The 'if' framing in his statements ('If it comes to pass that this is what the people of Texas want') suggests he is testing waters rather than committed to running. Good forecasters weight the status quo heavily since the world changes slowly, and currently there are no concrete signals of an imminent announcement. However, several factors prevent this from being a very low probability: (1) 40 days is technically sufficient time to make an announcement if he decides quickly, (2) O'Rourke has a history of running for major offices (Senate 2018, President 2020, Governor 2022) showing he's willing to be a candidate, (3) he's actively discussing the possibility publicly which keeps the door open, and (4) politicians sometimes move faster than expected when they sense opportunity. Why not lower (15-20%): His public statements indicate active consideration, and he has the name recognition and base to launch quickly if motivated. Why not higher (40-50%): He's lost three consecutive major races which may make him more cautious; there's no evidence of campaign preparation; the conditional language suggests hesitation; and absent any visible precursors, a dramatic shift to announcement within 40 days would contradict the typical slow pace of political decision-making. To revise upward, I'd need to see: FEC filings, campaign staff hiring, major donor commitments, or more definitive public statements. To revise downward: explicit statements ruling out a 2026 run, or time passing without any movement.",
