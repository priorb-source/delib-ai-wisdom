    "no_outcome_scenario": "No member of the European Parliament announces their resignation in the 21-day period between June 10 and June 30, 2025. Any fallout from the Huawei lobbying scandal is either contained or investigations proceed without forcing a resignation within the timeframe. Furthermore, no MEPs are appointed to new roles in their national governments or other institutions that would require them to resign during this specific period.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one member of the European Parliament announces their resignation between June 10 and June 30, 2025. This could be triggered by pressure from the Huawei lobbying scandal, or, more likely, because an MEP accepts a different position, such as a minister in their national government, following the European elections.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the timing of the resolution window rather than the specific scandal mentioned. The window, from June 10 to June 30, 2025, occurs in the immediate aftermath of the European Parliament elections (ending June 9). This is a period of significant political transition across the 27 member states.\n\nThe status quo is that MEPs do not resign frequently, which would favor a 'No' outcome in a random three-week period. However, the post-election context is the critical factor. It is common for MEPs to be appointed to roles in their national governments or other European institutions during such reshuffles. With 720 MEPs, the probability that at least one will be appointed to a new post and announce their resignation within this three-week window is substantial. This is the most likely path to a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nThe Huawei lobbying scandal mentioned is a secondary factor that slightly increases the probability. A scandal breaking in the post-election spotlight could create intense pressure, leading to a swift resignation, but this is a less probable scenario than a standard political career move.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the 21-day window is very specific and relatively short. Government formations and political appointments can be slow, and announcements could easily fall outside this period, even if the decisions are made within it.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the large number of MEPs (720) from 27 different national political systems creates many opportunities for a resignation event. The likelihood of a complete absence of resignations for political, personal, health, or scandal-related reasons across the entire Parliament for this specific high-churn period seems less likely than the occurrence of at least one.\n\nI would raise my probability if specific reports emerged of an MEP being considered for a national cabinet post or if the Huawei scandal escalates to name individuals. I would lower it if news from major member states indicated their governments were stable and no post-election reshuffles were planned.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any members of the European Parliament resign before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nEuro News: [Lobbying scandal related to Huawei: What we know so far](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/05/21/lobbying-scandal-related-to-huawei-what-we-know-so-far)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the European Parliament announces their resignation after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
