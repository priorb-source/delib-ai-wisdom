    "review": "Both forecasters use the same decomposition I did: P(fight occurs at UFC 316) × P(Merab wins | occurs). They cite similar base rates (roughly 75–85% for bout occurrence) and a slight stylistic lean to Merab on wrestling/cardio over five rounds, while noting O’Malley’s KO/damage equity and judging volatility. New useful angles they emphasized: damage-over-control judging trends, small-cage/altitude/referee effects, and explicitly anchoring bout-occurrence at ~80%. They also flagged that the “2” implies a rematch, which—without knowing the first result—adds uncertainty that might temper confidence either way. No hard new information (e.g., markets, camps, injuries) was introduced. I find their reasoning sound and largely consistent with my own, with a modest pull toward using 80% for bout occurrence rather than my slightly higher prior.",
    "rationale": "I keep the same structure but nudge assumptions to match the group consensus and acknowledge rematch uncertainty: (1) P(fight occurs at UFC 316) ≈ 80% given typical PPV headliner stability months out; (2) P(Merab wins | occurs) ≈ 55%, reflecting a small stylistic edge from pace/wrestling against O’Malley’s significant striking/finishing and round-stealing potential under current judging emphases. Unconditional ≈ 0.80 × 0.55 = 44%. I’m trimming 1 point from my prior (45% → 44%) mainly by slightly lowering the occurrence probability to 80% and acknowledging that if the first meeting (unknown here) favored O’Malley, the conditional could be closer to even. Upside/downside movers remain: weigh-ins and clean fight week (up), markets shifting toward Merab (up), or any injury/withdrawal/market shift to O’Malley (down).",
