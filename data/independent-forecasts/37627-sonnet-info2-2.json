  "information": "A proposal was made for direct Russia-Ukraine talks to be held in Istanbul on May 15, 2025. Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to attend and invited Donald Trump to be present at the meeting. Trump expressed optimism about the talks and stated he was considering attending, but noted his schedule was busy. His schedule included a trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE from May 12, concluding on May 15, the same day as the proposed meeting.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "33 days (from May 13, 2025 to June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - absent specific catalyzing events requiring phone coordination, most days would not involve a Trump-Zelenskyy phone call",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Zelenskyy coordinate on the Istanbul talks through intermediaries or written communications. Trump decides not to attend the May 15 meeting, reducing the need for direct phone coordination. Any subsequent Ukraine-related discussions over the next month happen through diplomatic channels or in-person meetings rather than phone calls. Alternatively, a phone call occurs but one or both parties decline to publicly acknowledge it.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Given Trump's Middle East trip concluding on May 15 (the same day as the proposed Istanbul talks), Trump calls Zelenskyy to discuss his attendance decision or coordinate positions before the meeting. Alternatively, in the weeks following the Istanbul talks, they have a phone call to discuss implementation of any agreements or next steps in Ukraine negotiations. Both parties publicly acknowledge the call occurred.",
    "rationale": "The May 15 Istanbul talks create a strong near-term catalyst for a phone call. Trump's schedule conflict - being in the Middle East until May 15, the exact day of the proposed meeting - makes phone coordination highly logical. If Trump decides to attend, he'd likely call to confirm; if he cannot attend, he'd likely call to explain and discuss representation. The 33-day window provides substantial time for at least one call to occur. Trump and Zelenskyy have an established pattern of phone communication. As US President deeply involved in Ukraine policy, Trump would naturally engage directly with Zelenskyy during active peace negotiations. However, I'm not forecasting higher because: (1) they might meet in person at Istanbul instead, (2) they could use intermediaries or other communication methods, (3) the talks might not occur as planned, (4) the 'both must acknowledge' requirement adds verification uncertainty. I'm not forecasting lower because the combination of the imminent high-stakes diplomatic event and the substantial time window makes at least one acknowledged phone call more likely than not. I would revise upward if: Trump definitively commits to attending Istanbul remotely, or if reports emerge of planned phone coordination. I would revise downward if: the Istanbul talks are cancelled, Trump attends in person without prior phone contact, or reports suggest they're coordinating exclusively through other channels.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News: [Key moments that have shaped Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-zelenskyys-relationship-from-perfect-phone-call-to-oval-office-clash-13331892)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA proposal was made for direct Russia-Ukraine talks to be held in Istanbul on May 15, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
