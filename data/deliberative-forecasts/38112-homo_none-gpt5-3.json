    "review": "Both forecasters add useful nuance. I agree with their emphasis on (1) the unanimity hurdle with 10 members, (2) India/Brazil’s relative caution, and (3) the absence of credible pre-summit leaks as a bearish signal. New to my framing was their point that the Indonesia upgrade occurred off-summit, which slightly raises the odds that another invitation could come before Rio as a late-breaking deliverable. They also sharpened the candidate landscape: Malaysia/Thailand/Nigeria/Kazakhstan as relatively palatable, versus Belarus/Cuba/Turkey as high-veto-risk. I’m less convinced by Forecaster 2’s weight on “host wants a deliverable” pushing odds into the mid-40s; hosts can showcase institutional deepening and partner-track operationalization instead. Forecaster 3’s view that the lack of public signaling by late May is meaningfully bearish resonates with me and keeps me from moving too high.",
    "rationale": "My base case (32%) leaned toward No given recent expansion, the new partner tier to manage demand, and unanimity constraints—especially with India and Brazil’s historical caution. From deliberation: I modestly increase the probability because (a) Indonesia’s January accession demonstrates the pipeline can move between summits, creating a non-trivial chance of a pre-Rio invite; (b) Brazil-as-host could still seek at least one consensus addition from the more neutral partners; and (c) Russia/China maintain pro-expansion momentum. Offsetting that are (1) no substantive leaks or sherpa-level signals by late May, (2) potential desire to consolidate after Indonesia’s addition this year, and (3) veto risks for several visible aspirants, which makes identifying a consensus candidate harder on a short timeline. Net effect: small upward adjustment, but I remain below 40% due to signaling and unanimity hurdles.",
