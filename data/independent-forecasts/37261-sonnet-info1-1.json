  "information": "The '50501' movement, a decentralized organization originating from a Reddit forum, planned nationwide protests on May 1, 2025, coinciding with International Workers' Day. The protests were organized to oppose the Trump administration's policies on immigration and labor. The movement's website listed over 1,000 events across all 50 states, with major demonstrations expected in Washington D.C., Chicago, Denver, Seattle, and Los Angeles. Organizations supporting the protests included the Political Revolution PAC and the Service Employees International Union. News reports following the event stated that over 1,100 protests took place under the '50501' banner across the U.S. and worldwide.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - major protests just occurred on May 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "None of the 1,100+ May 1st protests actually reached 10,000 participants in a single location (they were distributed as many smaller gatherings), the Global Protest Tracker does not report them or reports lower numbers, and no additional large protests occur before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the major May 1st demonstrations in cities like Washington D.C., Chicago, Denver, Seattle, or Los Angeles had 10,000+ participants and the Global Protest Tracker reports it. Alternatively, another large protest occurs before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The May 1, 2025 '50501' protests represent a critical data point. With over 1,100 events nationwide, major demonstrations in multiple large cities, and backing from significant organizations like SEIU and Political Revolution PAC, the probability that at least one location exceeded 10,000 participants is very high. May Day/International Workers' Day protests historically draw substantial crowds in major US cities, and union involvement typically ensures strong turnout. The key uncertainties are: (1) whether any single protest location actually reached the 10,000 threshold - the 1,100 events could theoretically be many smaller gatherings rather than concentrated large protests; (2) whether the Global Protest Tracker will report these events and their participant counts; and (3) potential reporting delays. However, working in favor of a Yes outcome: major cities like DC and LA typically see large protest turnouts for nationally coordinated events, and there remain approximately 2 months for additional protests to occur even if May 1st doesn't qualify. The forecast is not higher (95%+) because of uncertainty around actual participation numbers at individual locations and Global Protest Tracker reporting practices. It's not lower (70%) because the scale and organization of the May 1st events, combined with the remaining time window, make large protests very likely. I would update higher if confirmation emerges of specific attendance figures at May 1st protests or if the Global Protest Tracker publishes data showing 10,000+ participants. I would update lower if reliable reporting indicates all May 1st protests were smaller than expected and the political climate quiets.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in the United States with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBrookings Institution: [The power of protest in the US](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-power-of-protest-in-the-us/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in the United States with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe '50501' movement, a decentralized organization originating from a Reddit forum, planned nationwide protests on May 1, 2025, coinciding with International Workers' Day.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
