  "information": "The typical time between Starlink receiving a license and service being listed as 'Available' in a country has ranged from under three months to over one year. Faster rollouts have generally occurred in countries that issued express government invitations and where Starlink had an existing ground station or permission to use foreign gateways. SpaceX can serve Bangladesh using its existing laser-linked satellites without waiting for local gateways to be built. Following the license approval, it was reported that Starlink is preparing a tariff plan to be submitted to the Bangladeshi regulator for review.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BTRC takes several weeks to approve Starlink’s tariff plan and related commercial terms; import clearances and payment-channel setup in local currency lag; Starlink prioritizes operational setup and partner onboarding over flipping the country to “Available,” so the map remains “Coming Soon/Targeting 2025” through June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Within the next 2–3 weeks BTRC approves tariffs and any remaining conditions (e.g., lawful intercept/consumer protection terms). Starlink posts Bangladesh pricing, opens orders, and updates the map to “Available” in mid-to-late June, potentially using laser backhaul without a local gateway while logistics for terminals ramp.",
    "rationale": "We have roughly six weeks left. Historically, the lag from license to the Starlink map switching to “Available” has ranged from under 3 months to over a year. Fast rollouts tend to follow explicit political push and/or preexisting gateway arrangements or allowance for foreign gateways/laser backhaul. Bangladesh reportedly granted final approval and Starlink is preparing a tariff plan for regulator review—a clear sign that some regulatory/commercial steps remain. With only ~45 days left, the default is that these steps slip into July or later.\n\nEvidence pushing up the odds: (1) political top-cover (“final approval”) can accelerate internal government processing; (2) Starlink can serve via laser-linked satellites without waiting for a local gateway if the license allows it; (3) Starlink has recently executed rapid country launches when governments prioritized them (e.g., Indonesia’s swift go-live after high-level backing).\n\nEvidence pushing down the odds: (1) Bangladesh’s tariff approval and consumer-pricing oversight can be bureaucratic; (2) import controls/FX/payment setup and tax treatment must be finalized for commercial sales; (3) even when technically feasible, Starlink generally flips a country to “Available” concurrent with real shipment capability, not weeks in advance; (4) the historical median from license to availability is longer than the time remaining.\n\nWhy not higher? Because the gating item (tariff approval and commercial enablement) often takes longer than six weeks in South Asian regulatory contexts, and Starlink rarely marks “Available” before it can actually fulfill orders. Why not lower? Because top-level political approval plus the ability to operate without a local gateway makes a June launch feasible if the regulator moves quickly.\n\nWhat would move me up: public BTRC approval of Starlink tariffs; Bangladesh-specific pricing appearing on Starlink’s site; reports of terminals clearing customs or a local distribution partner announcement; any Starlink communications indicating a June Bangladesh launch. What would move me down: signs of additional conditions (e.g., data localization/lawful intercept infrastructure) before commercial service, FX/payment constraints, or news that tariff approval has been deferred to July or later.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Bangladesh as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Bangladeshi leader gives final approval to Musk's Starlink service](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/bangladeshi-leader-gives-final-approval-to-musks-starlink-service/3551404)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Bangladesh listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe typical time between Starlink receiving a license and service being listed as 'Available' in a country has ranged from under three months to over one year. Faster rollouts have generally occurred in countries that issued express government invitations and where Starlink had an existing ground station or permission to use foreign gateways.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
