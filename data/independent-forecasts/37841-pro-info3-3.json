  "information": "As of late May 2025, Kneecap remains officially listed on the Glastonbury 2025 lineup for the West Holts stage, and festival organizers have not issued any public statement regarding the controversies or the recent charge. Several venues and European festivals, including the Eden Project, Plymouth Pavilions, and Germany's Hurricane and Southside festivals, have cancelled Kneecap's scheduled appearances. However, other events have proceeded; London's Wide Awake Festival confirmed the band would still perform on May 24, and the band played a surprise gig in London on May 22, the day after the terrorism charge was made public.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The festival is scheduled for June 25-29, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Kneecap is currently on the official lineup for Glastonbury 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury Festival organisers, facing intense political and media pressure following a terrorism charge against a band member, decide the security and reputational risk is too high and officially remove Kneecap from the lineup.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Consistent with its counter-cultural ethos, Glastonbury's organisers resist the political pressure and retain the band on the bill. The band's legal situation does not escalate to prevent their travel, and they perform their set as scheduled.",
    "rationale": "The strongest factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the status quo: as of late May 2025, just one month before the event, Kneecap remains on the official lineup. Furthermore, the band has successfully performed at other UK events after the recent controversies and charges became public knowledge, indicating that not all promoters are risk-averse. Glastonbury's history of embracing controversial and political acts could lead its organisers to stand by the booking as a matter of principle. However, the factors favouring a 'No' outcome are exceptionally strong. A band member facing a charge under the UK's Terrorism Act presents an unprecedented level of security, political, and reputational risk for a major festival. This is far more severe than controversies over lyrics or political statements. Several other large venues and festivals have already cancelled Kneecap's performances, setting a precedent. Given the scale of Glastonbury and its duties regarding public safety and licensing, it is highly probable that the organisers will be compelled, either by external pressure from authorities or their own risk assessment, to cancel the performance. My probability is not lower because Glastonbury has a unique culture of defiance and the band is still officially scheduled to play. It is not higher because a charge under the Terrorism Act is an extremely serious matter that any major event organiser would find difficult to ignore. I would become more confident in a 'Yes' outcome if the festival issued a statement of support or if the charges were dropped. I would become more confident in 'No' if the band is quietly removed from the online schedule or an official cancellation is announced.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, Kneecap remains officially listed on the Glastonbury 2025 lineup for the West Holts stage, and festival organizers have not issued any public statement regarding the controversies or the recent charge. Several venues and European festivals, including the Eden Project, Plymouth Pavilions, and Germany's Hurricane and Southside festivals, have cancelled Kneecap's scheduled appearances. However, other events have proceeded; London's Wide Awake Festival confirmed the band would still perform on May 24, and the band played a surprise gig in London on May 22, the day after the terrorism charge was made public.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
