    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The trade data for April 2025 is scheduled to be released by the US Census Bureau in its 'U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services' report in early June 2025, approximately five to six weeks from today's date of April 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo outcome is 'Yes'. Absent any major economic shocks, underlying US economic growth and baseline inflation would lead to a year-over-year increase in the nominal value of imports, exceeding the April 2024 level.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would likely result from a significant negative economic shock. This could include the onset of a US recession in late 2024 or early 2025, which would suppress consumer and business demand for imported goods. Alternatively, the swift implementation of highly disruptive, protectionist trade policies early in the year could cause a sharp contraction in import volumes sufficient to lower the total value.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome would occur if the US economy continues its trend of modest growth with persistent low-level inflation. Strong consumer spending, stable business investment, and a relatively strong US dollar would all contribute to pushing the nominal value of imports for April 2025 above the April 2024 threshold of $338.483 billion.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong tendency for nominal economic data to increase year-over-year due to the combined effects of real economic growth and inflation. The threshold for a 'Yes' is any value greater than the April 2024 level ($338.483 billion), meaning even minimal nominal growth resolves the question as 'Yes'. Given consensus forecasts for continued, albeit modest, US economic growth and inflation in 2025, this is the most probable outcome. The research assistant's report indicated no new information was available to alter this baseline. My probability is not higher than 80% primarily due to significant policy uncertainty. As the provided background material suggests, a new administration could implement aggressive tariffs in early 2025. Such a policy shift could disrupt trade flows and suppress import values by April 2025. A secondary risk is a sharper-than-expected economic slowdown or recession. My probability is not lower because a year-over-year decline in nominal imports is historically rare and typically requires a significant economic contraction. The forces of economic inertia and inflation create a strong tailwind for a 'Yes' outcome. I would raise my probability with stronger-than-expected Q1 2025 economic data and lower it if a severe tariff regime is rapidly implemented in January/February 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US imports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of imports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 338,483 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
