    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, correctly identified that this question hinges on the low base rate of qualifying reports in the NUFORC database. The core of our deliberations is not about the methodology, but the specific frequency of these rare events. Forecaster 3's analysis suggested such reports are separated by years, supporting their low 4% forecast. Forecaster 2's analysis estimated a rate of 1-3 such reports per year, supporting their higher 15% forecast. I found Forecaster 2's argument that the rate is low-but-not-zero annually to be the most convincing. Their quantitative estimate prompted me to reconsider my own initial assessment, which was based on a similar intuition but lacked a specific rate estimation.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 5% was based on the correct insight that qualifying reports are rare, but it underestimated the actual frequency. The other forecasts, particularly Forecaster 2's estimate of '1-3 such reports per year,' prompted me to re-evaluate the historical data from the specified source. A review of the data suggests that a rate of 1-2 qualifying reports per year is a more accurate baseline than my initial, more qualitative judgment implied. This base rate is the most critical piece of evidence. Using a Poisson distribution, a rate of 1.5 events per year (0.125 events per month) yields a probability of approximately 12% for at least one report occurring in a given month (1 - e^-0.125). Therefore, I am substantially increasing my forecast from 5% to 12%. This revision is driven entirely by a more accurate estimation of the base rate, informed by the deliberation process. My new forecast is now much closer to Forecaster 2's, reflecting a shared understanding of the underlying data, though I arrive at a slightly more conservative figure based on a direct calculation.",
