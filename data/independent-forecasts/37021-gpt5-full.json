  "information": "According to Ukraine's State Statistics Service, the annual inflation rate has shown an accelerating trend in early 2025, rising from 12.9% in January to 13.4% in February, and reaching 14.6% in March. The monthly inflation rate for March 2025 was 1.5%, up from 0.8% in February. The March data represents the highest annual inflation rate since May 2023. Specific price increases in March were significant in several categories, including eggs (+18.8%) and clothing and footwear (+13.3%). On a year-over-year basis, food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by 17.4%, while housing, water, electricity, gas, and other fuels rose by 20.2%.\n\nThe National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) has maintained its key interest rate at 15.5% in an effort to control inflation. The NBU revised its year-end 2025 inflation forecast to 8.7% and its 2025 GDP growth forecast down to 3.1%. NBU statements indicate an expectation that inflation will peak in the second quarter of 2025 and subsequently decline during the summer, partly due to an anticipated increase in crop yields, which is projected to lower food inflation. The bank has identified ongoing risks including the war, infrastructure damage, and labor shortages.\n\nThe primary factors driving recent inflation include increased production costs for businesses and supply chain disruptions resulting from the war. Intensified attacks on energy infrastructure and population mobilization have also been cited as contributing pressures. The cost of the 2025 Easter food basket was reported to be 18-19% higher than in the previous year. On the other hand, potential disinflationary factors include the NBU's monetary policy and a reported decrease in consumer demand. Some economists expect seasonal factors to lead to an increase in vegetable production and a subsequent decrease in food prices in late spring or early summer.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3 weeks (April 2025 CPI likely released in mid-May by Derzhstat; Trading Economics updates shortly after)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Slight further rise in y/y CPI, crossing the 15.0% threshold in April 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "April m/m inflation prints very low (~0–0.3%) due to early seasonal drops in vegetables and stable fuel, while April 2024 had a relatively higher monthly base; y/y stalls just below the threshold (≈14.7–14.9%).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Orthodox Easter falls in April 2025 (vs May in 2024), shifting seasonal food demand into April, combined with ongoing war-related supply disruptions and energy issues; April m/m around 0.6–1.0% versus a low April 2024 base, pushing y/y to roughly 15.1–15.6%.",
    "rationale": "The annual inflation rate has accelerated in early 2025: 12.9% (Jan) → 13.4% (Feb) → 14.6% (Mar), with a high March m/m of 1.5%. Food (+17.4% y/y) and housing/utilities (+20.2% y/y) are leading categories. The NBU holds the policy rate at 15.5% and guides that inflation should peak in Q2 before easing in summer; that implies April/May are prime months for the local peak. To reach 15.0% in April, the y/y rate needs only a 0.4 pp increase from March. That is plausible if April m/m is moderately positive and the April 2024 base was low. Orthodox Easter in 2025 occurs in April (it was in May in 2024), which likely shifts seasonal food price pressures into April this year, making a favorable base effect more likely. Ongoing attacks on energy infrastructure and higher production costs also support upside pressure. Countervailing forces include tight monetary policy, weak demand, possible currency stability, and seasonal produce easing that typically starts late spring; if April m/m is unusually soft or if April 2024 had a higher-than-remembered monthly rise, the y/y could remain just under 15%. I weight the status quo—continued, but moderating, acceleration—more heavily, consistent with the NBU’s Q2 peak narrative and the small gap to 15.0%. I would raise the probability if there are reports of April utility tariff hikes, widespread blackout-related supply disruptions, or high-frequency data showing strong food price gains through late April. I would lower it on evidence of a sharp drop in weekly food prices, a notable strengthening of the hryvnia, declines in fuel prices, or early harvest effects materially reducing produce prices.",
