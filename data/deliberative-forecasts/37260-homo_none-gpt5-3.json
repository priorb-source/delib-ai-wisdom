    "review": "Both forecasters align with my core reasoning: only the Federal Constitutional Court can ban a party; proceedings are multi-year; and there’s no sign of a filed, docketed, or expedited case. Forecaster 2 adds a useful emphasis on the practical impossibility given the procedural steps remaining and floats a very small tail for unprecedented interim measures. Forecaster 3 underscores the high legal threshold (including the “concrete potential” prong from the 2017 NPD decision) and the requirement that the competent authority’s announcement is necessary for resolution—helpfully narrowing the path. Neither introduces new factual developments suggesting imminent action, but their emphasis on the Court’s timelines and the lack of any filing further supports an even lower near-term probability than my initial 1%.",
    "rationale": "The decisive factors are unchanged: no known formal application by a competent applicant, an extremely short time window (~60 days), and historical precedent of multi-year timelines for party bans. Even if a filing occurred imminently, the Court would still need extensive submissions, potential hearings, and deliberation; there is no precedent for an interim, de facto party ban within weeks, and it would likely be at odds with the Court’s cautious approach to party prohibitions. The added stress by the other forecasters on the “concrete potential” threshold and the necessity of a Constitutional Court announcement reinforces the improbability of resolution by July 1. I slightly lower my estimate to reflect that the already tiny path (e.g., shocking new evidence and truly unprecedented expedited measures) is even narrower than I had implicitly allowed for.",
