    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Niger maintains its current travel advisory level (likely Level 3 - Reconsider Travel) without escalation to Level 4",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Niger's security situation remains relatively stable under military rule. No major incidents involving US citizens occur. Terrorist activities continue at current manageable levels without dramatic escalation. The State Department sees no compelling reason to upgrade the advisory from its current level to the most severe Level 4 designation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major security incident occurs in Niger, such as a significant terrorist attack, kidnapping of Western nationals, complete governmental collapse, or outbreak of armed conflict. The deteriorating situation prompts the US State Department to escalate to Level 4 - Do Not Travel, joining countries like Afghanistan, Syria, and Yemen in this category.",
    "rationale": "The key factors in this forecast:\n\n**Current Situation:** Niger experienced a military coup in July 2023 and faces ongoing security challenges including terrorism from groups like Boko Haram and ISIS affiliates, crime, and limited infrastructure. However, these factors likely place Niger at Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) rather than Level 4 currently. The US State Department reserves Level 4 for only the most extreme situations - active warfare, complete state collapse, or imminent danger to all Americans.\n\n**Status Quo Bias:** Good forecasting requires weighting the status quo heavily. Travel advisories are \"sticky\" - they don't change frequently without major triggering events. In a 2-month window, the baseline expectation should be no change.\n\n**What Would Need to Change:** For escalation to Level 4, Niger would need to experience: (1) A dramatic security deterioration, (2) Direct attacks on American interests, (3) Complete loss of governmental control, or (4) Outbreak of widespread conflict. While Niger faces challenges, such extreme escalation in just 2 months is unlikely.\n\n**Why Not Higher:** The 2-month timeframe is very short. Most African countries facing similar challenges (terrorism, coups, instability) maintain Level 3 advisories for extended periods. Niger hasn't shown signs of the catastrophic collapse that would trigger Level 4.\n\n**Why Not Lower:** Niger does face genuine security risks post-coup. Regional instability in the Sahel is real, and unexpected escalation is possible. The probability isn't negligible.\n\n**Update Conditions:** I would increase my forecast if: reports emerge of major attacks, kidnappings of Westerners, or significant military conflict. I would decrease it if: the security situation stabilizes or the State Department issues statements indicating no advisory changes planned.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Niger receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Niger Faces Growing Travel Risks: U.S. Travel Advisory Highlights Terrorism, Crime, and Limited Medical Care for Tourists in the Country](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/niger-faces-growing-travel-risks-u-s-travel-advisory-highlights-terrorism-crime-and-limited-medical-care-for-tourists-in-the-country/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Niger has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Niger.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
