    "review": "My initial forecast (85%) was very similar to Forecaster 3's (75%), focusing on the powerful political and diplomatic incentives for President Orsi to accept the invitation from Brazil's President Lula. However, Forecaster 2 introduced a critical and decisive piece of new information that I had not considered: President Orsi's confirmed attendance at a UN conference in Seville, Spain from June 30 to July 3, 2025. This scheduling conflict represents a hard logistical barrier that fundamentally undermines the feasibility of a presidential visit to the BRICS summit in early July. This new fact makes Forecaster 2's reasoning highly convincing. The logistical impossibility, or at least extreme difficulty, of the President being in two continents during the same narrow time window is a much stronger piece of evidence than the 'soft' evidence of political alignment.",
    "rationale": "I am drastically revising my forecast downward from 85% to 15%. My initial analysis was based on the strong diplomatic incentives for Uruguay to accept the invitation, a view shared by Forecaster 3. However, the new information provided by Forecaster 2 regarding President Orsi's confirmed trip to Spain from June 30 to July 3 is a game-changer. The resolution deadline for this question is July 1, a date on which the President is scheduled to be in Spain. It is highly improbable that the Uruguayan government would announce that its head of state plans to attend a summit in Brazil at the same time he is committed to a conference in Europe. Such an announcement would be a logistical and diplomatic contradiction. The most likely scenarios now are that Uruguay either announces that a different official (e.g., the Foreign Minister) will attend, or that they make no announcement before the July 1 deadline, both of which would resolve this question as 'No'. I have not lowered my forecast to absolute zero because there is a small chance the government makes a purely symbolic announcement of intent to satisfy Brazil, or that the Spain trip is unexpectedly canceled or altered, but this hard scheduling constraint makes a 'Yes' outcome exceptionally unlikely.",
