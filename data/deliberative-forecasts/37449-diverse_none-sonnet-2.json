    "review": "Both forecasters provide strong analyses that largely align with my initial assessment. Forecaster 3 makes a particularly compelling argument about U.S. language patterns that I underweighted: Washington has historically avoided using 'blockade' terminology even during significant Chinese military pressure, such as large-scale PLA exercises that encircled Taiwan and disrupted traffic. This historical precedent suggests the threshold for the U.S. to publicly accuse China of 'blockading' Taiwan is even higher than I initially considered. Forecaster 2's emphasis on economic catastrophe and Chinese pragmatism reinforces the low-probability assessment. Both correctly note that gray-zone coercion is far more likely than a formal blockade. The key insight from Forecaster 3 is that the resolution criteria requires very specific language - not just U.S. criticism of Chinese coercion, but an explicit accusation of 'blockading.' This linguistic bar is demonstrably high based on past U.S. behavior. All three forecasts fall in the narrow 3-5% range, suggesting strong consensus on the fundamental dynamics.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find Forecaster 3's argument about U.S. linguistic caution particularly persuasive. The historical pattern shows Washington has avoided calling Chinese military pressure a 'blockade' even during significant coercive episodes. This raises the bar for resolution beyond just Chinese action - it requires the U.S. to use specific, escalatory language that it has historically avoided. This suggests my initial 4% may be slightly high. However, I don't want to discount entirely the tail risks we've all acknowledged: miscalculation, rapid escalation, or an unexpected triggering event remain possible in the 56-day window. The difference between 3% and 4% is marginal, but Forecaster 3's detailed analysis on language patterns and historical precedent tips the balance. I'm adjusting downward to align with the most thorough analysis while still reflecting meaningful tail risk above the 2% threshold.",
