  "information": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it will decommission its 'Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters' database. The database, created in 1980 to track the financial costs of major climate events, will not be updated beyond 2024 and its existing information will be archived. According to AM Best, a credit rating agency, the removal of this centralized data source could hinder insurance companies' ability to model, price, and manage risks associated with climate-related disasters. NOAA communications chief Kim Doster stated the change is 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes'.\n\nThe Trump administration has implemented significant budget and staff cuts at NOAA. According to reports, hundreds of scientists and climate experts have been laid off, sparking concern over the future of climate research and environmental policy. These actions are seen by some as aligning with the 'Project 2025' plan promoted by the Heritage Foundation, which proposes dismantling the agency. Additionally, some of NOAA's regional climate centers have been shut down, and all contributors to the National Climate Assessment have been fired.\n\nOn April 4, 2025, a NOAA spokesperson stated that the agency's websites will remain online. Following an internal memo that had warned of potential data loss if sites went down, the spokesperson confirmed, 'There will be no interruption in service. All NOAA Research sites will remain online.' The statement specifically referred to websites connected to NOAA's Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, which focus on climate change, extreme weather research, and drought monitoring.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month and 10 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, Climate.gov remains online as it is currently operational.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following guidance inspired by initiatives like 'Project 2025', a top-down directive from the administration is issued to remove 'non-essential' climate information websites, overriding previous agency assurances. Due to recent staff and budget cuts, the website is either taken down intentionally or a technical failure occurs that the agency is unable to fix before the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The NOAA spokesperson's April 4, 2025 statement holds true, and the agency keeps its public-facing research websites online. Despite the broader political environment and budget cuts to other programs, the administration avoids the public backlash of taking down a major informational site, or the bureaucratic process to do so is not completed by July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily anchored on the status quo and the high degree of institutional inertia associated with government websites. Climate.gov is currently online, and a specific action would be required to take it down. The most crucial piece of evidence is the direct and recent statement from a NOAA spokesperson on April 4, 2025, which explicitly confirmed, 'All NOAA Research sites will remain online.' This provides a strong, specific counter-narrative to the broader political pressures. The short timeframe of just over a month until resolution also makes a 'Yes' outcome more likely, as bureaucratic and technical processes for a site takedown can be slow. \n\nHowever, I am not forecasting a higher probability because the political context introduces significant risk. The research report highlights a clear administrative intent to curtail climate-related activities at NOAA, evidenced by significant budget and staff cuts, the firing of contributors to the National Climate Assessment, and the decommissioning of the 'Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters' database. These actions demonstrate that the administration is willing and able to remove public climate data resources, making a sudden policy reversal regarding Climate.gov a non-trivial possibility. \n\nMy forecast is not lower because the specific evidence (the spokesperson's statement) is more directly relevant to the question than the general political environment. Taking down a major public-facing website is also a more visible and politically costly action than decommissioning a specialized database or cutting internal staff. The potential for public and scientific backlash may act as a deterrent.\n\nI would update my forecast towards 'No' if a new directive contradicting the April statement were issued by a political appointee, or if other major government climate websites (e.g., from the EPA or NASA) were suddenly taken offline. I would update towards 'Yes' as the resolution date approaches without any negative news or actions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA's Climate.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNational Security Archive: [Disappearing Data: Trump Administration Removing Climate Information from Government Websites](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/climate-change-transparency-project-foia/2025-02-06/disappearing-data-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
