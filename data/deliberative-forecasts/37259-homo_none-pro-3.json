    "review": "The two other forecasters arrived at the same 5% probability as my initial forecast, and their reasoning is highly convergent with my own. We all identified the same two primary drivers: the governing coalition's 'gradualist' approach to independence and the extremely short timeframe of less than two months until the resolution date. Their analyses did not introduce any contradictory evidence, but they did provide useful refinements. Specifically, Forecaster 3 made an excellent point that the absence of any political or media chatter about a referendum is itself strong evidence against an imminent announcement. They also articulated a plausible, low-probability scenario for a 'Yes' outcome that I had not explicitly detailed: the government could announce a referendum for a date far in the future as a strategic political move. I find their reasoning highly convincing, as it reinforces the logic behind a low but non-zero probability.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. The deliberation has strongly reinforced my initial assessment. The core arguments against a 'Yes' resolution remain unchanged and are now supported by a clear consensus: the newly elected government won on a gradualist platform that prioritizes economic stability over a swift independence vote, and there is insufficient time before July 1, 2025, for the necessary political groundwork and consensus-building that would precede such a major announcement. The points raised by the other forecasters, particularly the idea of using a far-future referendum announcement as a political tactic, provide a clearer picture of the low-probability scenarios that prevent the forecast from being closer to zero. However, these scenarios do not raise the overall probability, as they remain unlikely given the government's current stated priorities. The convergence of our independent analyses gives me higher confidence in my original forecast.",
