    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the decisive first fight and stylistic edge for Dvalishvili, which I agree should anchor the base rate. They also explicitly account for two key uncertainties: late cancellation risk (which resolves as No) and O’Malley’s potential post-surgery improvement. Forecaster 2’s 72% seems to assume both a high conditional win probability and relatively low cancellation risk; Forecaster 3 lands slightly lower, citing similar factors. New angles they surfaced or sharpened: (1) the cancellation risk within 12 days as a non-trivial driver; (2) the plausible upside from hip surgery improving O’Malley’s mobility (not just return to baseline). I give limited weight to pundit takes (Rogan, Cejudo) as they track consensus but aren’t independent evidence. Overall, their reasoning is sound and nudges me to slightly raise my conditional win estimate for Dvalishvili while keeping a realistic (single-digit) cancellation risk in the calculation.",
    "rationale": "I model P(Yes) = P(fight happens at UFC 316 with this matchup) × P(Dvalishvili wins | fight happens).\n- P(fight happens): ~0.92. With ~12 days to go and only minor injuries reported for Dvalishvili, late pullout risk exists but is modest for a PPV main event.\n- P(Dvalishvili wins | happens): ~0.73. He won the first fight clearly, has a sustained style edge (pressure wrestling, cardio, pace), and validated form by beating Umar Nurmagomedov. O’Malley’s KO threat and potential post-hip-surgery improvements add meaningful variance but likely don’t close the gap in one camp.\nNet: 0.92 × 0.73 ≈ 0.67. This is a slight upward revision from my prior 63%, reflecting a higher conditional win probability upon reconsideration of the first-fight dominance and typical rematch dynamics, while still pricing in cancellation risk and O’Malley’s upside.\nUpdates: I’d move up on clean weigh-ins/medical clearance and stable markets favoring Merab; down on credible injury aggravation, compromised weight cuts, or substantive reporting indicating O’Malley has markedly improved defensive wrestling/scrambling.",
