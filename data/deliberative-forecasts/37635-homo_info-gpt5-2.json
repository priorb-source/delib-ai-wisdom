    "review": "- New arguments I hadn’t incorporated: (1) Forecaster 3 notes Morning Consult showed Sheinbaum ~66 and Milei ~65 in late Jan, shifting to Milei 61 vs Sheinbaum 60 by late April—i.e., a modest MC momentum edge for Milei. (2) Forecaster 2 cites very high Mexico domestic polls (76–82%), implying honeymoon resilience that could buoy Sheinbaum.\n- Assessment: The MC momentum point is relevant and mildly pushes toward Yes, given MC’s inertia. The domestic-Mexico polling is directionally informative but not directly comparable to MC levels; I wouldn’t infer an imminent MC uptick solely from that. Both rightly stress the tie-as-No penalty and week-to-week noise.\n- Convincing vs not: I find F3’s 58% too high given the 1-point margin plus tie penalty and Argentina’s political/economic volatility. F2’s 43% better reflects the razor-thin edge and tie risk, though I don’t fully buy a strong upward bias for Sheinbaum on MC just from domestic polling.\n- Net effect: I modestly adjust upward from my prior to acknowledge MC’s recent ordering and short horizon, but stay below 50% due to tie risk and Milei’s softening signals in Argentine polling.",
    "rationale": "Time left is short (~45 days), and the last known MC snapshot has Milei +1 (61 vs 60). Morning Consult approvals are sticky, so the current ordering could persist. However, a one-point edge with integer rounding makes ties common, and ties resolve No, which mechanically drags the Yes probability below a naive 50/50. Fundamentals are mixed: Argentina’s disinflation and reform narrative can support Milei near 60, but local polling (D’Alessio IROL/Berensztein) shows a negative image differential (-8) and rising pessimism—suggesting downside risk to his MC number. Mexico’s honeymoon should keep Sheinbaum near ~60, with less volatility.\nBalancing: (a) the slight MC momentum toward Milei since January and short window (pushes up), against (b) tie-as-No, Milei’s domestic headwinds, and Sheinbaum’s likely steadiness around 60 (pushes down). Overall I edge my estimate up slightly from my prior but remain clearly below even odds.",
