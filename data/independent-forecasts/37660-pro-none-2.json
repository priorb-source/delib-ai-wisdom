    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite receiving the license, unforeseen logistical hurdles, such as delays in deploying ground station equipment or clearing consumer hardware through customs, push the official service launch just past the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the crucial license approval in August 2024, SpaceX and Sri Lankan authorities finalize the remaining operational and network preparations, leading to the service officially launching and the Starlink availability map being updated to 'Available' before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "The foundation for this forecast is the official granting of a license to Starlink by Sri Lanka's Telecommunications Regulatory Commission in August 2024. This is the most significant milestone for service activation. Since then, over nine months have passed, a typical timeframe for SpaceX to handle the subsequent logistical steps, including ground station deployment and hardware importation. The Sri Lankan government has been publicly supportive, aiming to enhance national connectivity, which suggests a favorable administrative environment for clearing any final hurdles. The current status for Sri Lanka on the Starlink map is reportedly 'Starting Soon,' which is typically the final stage before a country's status changes to 'Available.' Given these factors, the trajectory is strongly positive. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the deadline is only 1.5 months away, leaving a very small buffer for unexpected, even minor, logistical or bureaucratic delays which are common in such rollouts. SpaceX's global priorities could also shift, potentially deprioritizing the final activation in a smaller market like Sri Lanka if more urgent issues arise elsewhere.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the primary and most difficult step—securing the operational license—is complete. Combined with strong governmental support and the nine months already invested in preparation, it is more likely than not that the service will go live within the remaining window. \n\nI would increase my forecast if an official launch date is announced by either Starlink or the Sri Lankan government. I would decrease it if credible reports emerge of specific delays or regulatory complications.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Sri Lanka as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Musk's Starlink wins Sri Lanka licence](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/sri-lanka-regulator-grants-licence-musks-starlink-satellite-broadband-2024-08-13/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Sri Lanka listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
