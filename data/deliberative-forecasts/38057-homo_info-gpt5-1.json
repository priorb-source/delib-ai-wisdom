    "review": "New points raised: (1) Forecaster 2 cites a Jan 2025 Merab win over Umar Nurmagomedov—if accurate, that’s strong evidence Merab remains in peak form and should raise Merab’s conditional win probability. (2) Forecaster 3 notes O’Malley had hip surgery post-306 and this is his first fight back—this likely adds variance but, if anything, modestly favors Merab given wrestling/grappling demands. (3) Both put mid‑teens risk on the fight not happening; with ~12 days left, that feels a bit high—late cancellations still occur, but I’d peg bout-change/cancellation closer to high single digits. (4) Both appropriately emphasize O’Malley’s KO/intercept equity and rematch adjustments, and the judging trend favoring damage over control, which caps Merab’s decision equity somewhat. Overall, I find their conditional-in-cage numbers (around 60–62% for Merab) aligned with my view; I disagree with their elevated no-fight probability at this short horizon, and note their own added evidence (Merab over Umar; O’Malley first-fight-back) actually leans toward Merab rather than away.",
    "rationale": "Uncertainty decomposition: (a) Fight occurrence at UFC 316 with these two: I estimate ~90–92%. We’re ~12 days out; title headliners generally hold, though late pullouts remain possible. (b) Conditional on the fight happening: Merab ~64–66%. Basis: clear first-fight win via repeatable edges (pace, chain wrestling, cardio), recent form possibly strong if the Umar result is accurate, and O’Malley’s first fight back from hip surgery introduces ring-rust and unknown TDD implications. Counterweights: O’Malley’s elite striking and intercept counters, rematch-specific adjustments, and judging emphasis on damage could narrow Merab’s decision margin. Putting it together yields an unconditional in the low 60s. I slightly trim my prior 62% to acknowledge the non-trivial late-change/NC/draw risk and the judging trend, partly offset by the new (tentative) positives for Merab’s form and O’Malley’s layoff.",
