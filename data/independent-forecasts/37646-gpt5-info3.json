  "information": "Starlink can provide service to Somalia without an in-country gateway station due to its use of inter-satellite laser links, which can connect to ground stations in neighboring countries like Kenya or Ethiopia. A report by the Washington Post indicated that the U.S. government has been diplomatically promoting Starlink's expansion in various countries, including Somalia. Local challenges in Somalia include a fragile security environment, complex import logistics for user terminals, and difficulties with payment processing infrastructure. According to 2022 World Bank data, about 30% of Somalia's 18 million people have internet access.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the Starlink map does not currently show Somalia as Available, and absent changes it will remain that way.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The announced license is provisional or stalls in implementation (e.g., pending type approval, import permissions, or a required local partner). Starlink delays adding Somalia to its country list and availability map until logistics and payments are in place, or the regulator backtracks/asks for changes. The website remains “Coming soon/Not available” through June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Regulatory clearance is finalized and internally greenlit; Starlink updates its country list and toggles Somalia to “Available” (possibly announced on social channels). Because inter-satellite links remove the need for an in-country gateway, capacity is sufficient and at least part of Somalia is marked Available on the map before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence: Reports indicate a Starlink license for Somalia has been announced. Given Starlink’s laser backhaul, they do not need an in-country gateway to declare availability; they can use neighboring ground stations. The U.S. government has reportedly supported expansion, including in Somalia. These factors make a relatively quick flip to “Available” plausible.\n- Status quo inertia: As of today, Somalia is not shown as Available. Starlink often turns on countries weeks after licensing, but timelines vary and can stretch to months, especially where import logistics, device type approval, and payment rails are complex. Somalia’s security and regulatory environment increases the chance of operational or legal delays that keep the map unchanged through June.\n- Base-rate intuition: In many countries where licensing is publicly confirmed, Starlink updates the map within a few weeks to a couple of months. With ~1.5 months left, that suggests a better-than-even chance, but not overwhelming, especially given Somalia’s added frictions.\n- Why not higher: Uncertainty about whether the announced license is final and comprehensive (e.g., includes hardware type approval and spectrum/landing rights), potential need for a local partner, and the risk Starlink waits to list availability until import/payment logistics are in place. Any regulatory wobble or slow internal release cadence could push the website update past June.\n- Why not lower: The key technical constraint (backhaul) is not binding due to laser links; once regulatory permission is in place, Starlink has a track record of flipping countries to Available relatively quickly. Only “anywhere in Somalia” needs to show Available, lowering the bar.\n- What would move me up: Official regulatory gazette/notice confirming final authorization and equipment type approval; Starlink adding Somalia to the order country dropdown or a “Now available in Somalia” announcement; reseller/partner launch details.\n- What would move me down: Reports of regulatory pushback or a requirement to operate via a state ISP that needs a separate agreement; customs/import bans on terminals; Starlink pausing rollouts in high-risk areas or signals of a post-June release cadence.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Somalia as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Musk announces Starlink license for Somalia](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Musk_announces_Starlink_license_for_Somalia_999.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Somalia listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nStarlink can provide service to Somalia without an in-country gateway station due to its use of inter-satellite laser links, which can connect to ground stations in neighboring countries like Kenya or Ethiopia.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
