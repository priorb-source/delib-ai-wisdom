    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (Uber is not currently available in Turks and Caicos)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The government continues cracking down on unlicensed transport; taxi interests oppose ride-hailing; no regulatory carve-out is made; Uber makes no launch announcement and the Uber site/app continues to show no service in Turks and Caicos by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Uber announces a limited rollout (e.g., partnership with licensed taxi operators, airport-only service, or Uber Reserve) with government acquiescence, and the Uber website lists Turks and Caicos as available before July 1; credible local media report the launch.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon is short (~2 months). Uber typically signals new market entries with some lead time, especially in tightly regulated, tourism-heavy micro-markets.\n- Status quo: Turks and Caicos has a small population and a regulated taxi sector. The referenced article about warnings to tourism stakeholders regarding illegal taxis implies heightened enforcement and sensitivity around unlicensed or quasi-ride-hailing services. That environment reduces near-term odds of an Uber launch.\n- Market/precedent context: Many Caribbean islands with strong taxi lobbies (e.g., Cayman, Bahamas historically) have resisted Uber; launches often require either explicit regulatory frameworks or partnerships with licensed taxis. Such arrangements usually feature pre-announcements or negotiations that leak into local press—none are noted here. \n- Why not higher: No evidence of ongoing negotiations, pilot programs, job postings, or local governmental moves to enable e-hailing; the small market may not be a near-term priority for Uber.\n- Why not lower: Uber has occasionally executed rapid, limited-scope launches in challenging markets by partnering with licensed operators or structuring services (e.g., Uber Reserve, taxi integrations). A swift agreement with local taxi associations and government, coupled with tourism-facing service, is possible, if unlikely, within two months.\n- What would move me up: Credible local/government statements indicating a regulatory pathway; Uber announcing a taxi-partnership model; Uber’s site/app listing Turks and Caicos as “coming soon”; driver onboarding campaigns or press coverage of imminent launch.\n- What would move me down: Continued or escalated enforcement actions against informal transport; official statements rejecting ride-hailing; lack of any signals by early June.\n- Research assistant input: No additional info beyond the backdrop; thus, I lean heavily on the status quo and regional precedent.\n",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Uber be available in the Turks and Caicos Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tourism Stakeholders Warned About Encouraging Use of Illegal Taxis](https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/tourism-stakeholders-warned-about-encouraging-use-of-illegal-taxis/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Uber is available in Turks and Caicos as shown on the [Uber website](https://www.uber.com/us/en/search-results/?query=TURKS+AND+CAICOS) or according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
