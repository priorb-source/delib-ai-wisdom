    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Rippling remains a private company and does not make any official announcement to go public.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rippling's leadership continues to find the private markets sufficient for their capital needs and strategic goals. They prioritize product growth over the immediate demands of a public listing, and the June 30, 2025 deadline passes without an S-1 filing or a formal announcement on their website.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seizing what they perceive as a favorable market window, Rippling's board decides to act quickly on long-standing IPO preparations. They make a surprise announcement on their company blog or file their S-1 with the SEC before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo, which is that a private company will remain private. The primary factor driving my low probability is the extremely short timeframe of just over one month. Major corporate actions like an IPO are typically preceded by media leaks, reports of hiring investment banks, or other signals, none of which are present according to the available information. The process of preparing for an IPO and filing an S-1 is extensive, making a surprise announcement within this window unlikely, though not impossible.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because Rippling is a mature, large, and well-funded company widely considered to be a prime IPO candidate. It is plausible that the company has been preparing for this eventuality in secret and could decide to move swiftly if they perceive a strategic advantage or a favorable market window. The decision ultimately rests with a small group of people and could come as a surprise.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 5% due to the complete lack of any affirmative evidence. Without any public signals, rumors from credible financial news outlets, or indicative statements from company leadership, a higher probability would be purely speculative and contrary to the base rate of how IPOs are typically announced.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports (e.g., from Bloomberg, Reuters) of an imminent S-1 filing or if the CEO hinted at near-term IPO plans. I would decrease it if the company announced a new large round of private funding or if leadership explicitly ruled out a 2025 IPO.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Rippling announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Startup News: Shares of HR firm Rippling gain value as its business expands](https://forgeglobal.com/insights/blog/startup-news-shares-of-rippling-gain-value-as-its-business-expands/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Rippling, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.rippling.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
