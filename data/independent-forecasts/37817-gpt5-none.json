    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — small, slow-to-recover market with currently few scheduled nonstops; exceeding 5 destinations by July 1 would require multiple additions in a short window.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FlightsFrom lists only Guam, Taipei, and possibly one or two of Yap/Seoul/Tokyo/Manila. Seasonal or charter-style additions either don’t materialize, remain unscheduled, or are not shown as scheduled nonstops on FlightsFrom by early July, keeping the count at 5 or fewer.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "By July 1, FlightsFrom shows at least six distinct destinations, e.g., the baseline of Guam and Taipei plus confirmed, loaded schedules for a combination of Yap (United), Seoul (a Korean LCC), and at least two of Tokyo/Osaka/Manila/Hong Kong or other regional points, likely via subsidized or seasonal leisure service for summer 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and inertia: Palau (ROR) is a very small market with historically limited scheduled service. Post‑pandemic recovery has been slow, per the provided article noting that flights haven’t restarted in high volume and South Korean demand has shifted elsewhere. Absent clear evidence of multiple new routes, the status quo strongly favors 5 or fewer destinations.\n- Historical pattern: In recent years, consistent scheduled links have typically included Guam (United) and Taipei (China Airlines). Yap service via United has been intermittent; Seoul, Tokyo, and Manila have been sporadic or seasonal and often at low frequencies. Crossing 5 destinations requires at least six concurrently listed destinations on FlightsFrom, which is ambitious for ROR.\n- Timing: With about six weeks to go, most summer schedules would already be filed. While last‑minute seasonal or subsidized routes are possible, multiple near‑term additions would be needed to push the count to 6+ by July 1.\n- Structural constraints: Palau’s alignment with Taiwan reduces prospects of near‑term Chinese group-tour flights; overall demand remains fragile; airlines remain capacity‑constrained and selective.\n- Why not higher: To be Yes, we likely need both Korea and Japan service plus at least one of Manila/Hong Kong/Yap active and listed alongside Guam and Taipei. That’s a lot to line up in a small market within weeks.\n- Why not lower: There is some upside via summer leisure seasonality, government/NGO support for air links, and potential resumption of Korean or Japanese services. A couple of seasonal adds could quickly lift the count if they’re filed and appear on FlightsFrom.\n- What would move me up: Verified schedule filings (airline press releases, GDS/OTA listings, or the FlightsFrom ROR page) showing additional destinations for July (e.g., confirmed ICN and NRT/KIX service, or Manila returning), or confirmation that Yap is operating alongside those.\n- What would move me down: Evidence of cancellations/pauses on any of Guam/Taipei/Yap; lack of any new route announcements by mid‑June; or FlightsFrom showing 3–4 destinations as of late June.\n- Research assistant note: No extra info provided; forecast leans heavily on market fundamentals, recovery signals from 2024, and typical network behavior for small Pacific islands.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 5 direct flight destinations from Koror, Palau on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMarketplace: [Why hasn’t tourism recovered in Palau? Flights haven’t restarted in high volume since the pandemic drop-off, and South Koreans are booking their vacations elsewhere.](https://www.marketplace.org/story/2024/04/19/palau-tourism)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 5 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Koror (ROR)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/ROR) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
