    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 largely use the same evidence base. F2 makes a strong momentum case (training, high-level engagement, diversification) and treats the Q1 slip as routine, but seems to underweight two risks: (1) the resolution requires a government announcement (not just a company leak), and Hanoi sometimes keeps sensitive deals quiet; (2) being SK’s first arms sale to Vietnam raises political/optics sensitivity. F3’s balance is closer to mine: the missed Q1 target and lack of fresh positive signals in April are meaningful negatives. One additional factor I think both underweighted is timing guidance from Hanwha that more orders are expected in H2 2025, which raises the risk the announcement slips past July 1 even if the deal is real. Neither added concrete new facts beyond our shared reports; the main update is weighting: F2’s confidence looks too high given the announcement criterion and the calendar, while F3’s 50% seems reasonable but perhaps a touch optimistic given the potential for a signed-but-unannounced outcome.",
    "rationale": "Positives: credible Jan 2025 reporting of final-stage talks for ~20 K9s (~$300M); Vietnamese training on K9s in late 2024; upgraded bilateral partnership; strong strategic logic for Vietnam to diversify from Russia; Hanwha’s global K9 export momentum. Two months remain, which is sufficient if approvals are already lined up. Negatives: the Q1 finalization window passed without visible movement; Vietnamese public signaling has been minimal; this would be the first Korean arms sale to Vietnam and could invite heightened scrutiny and Chinese sensitivity, increasing the odds of caution or a quiet signature; package complexity (ammo/logistics, offsets/ToT, third‑party components) can slow closings; and importantly, resolution requires a government announcement by July 1. Even if they sign soon, Hanoi or Seoul might delay publicizing it or keep it low-key, which would resolve No. Hanwha’s own guidance about more orders in H2 2025 adds timing risk. Netting these, I modestly lift my prior on the basis that slippage from Q1 to Q2 is common, but keep the forecast below even odds because the announcement requirement and timing window remain binding risks.",
