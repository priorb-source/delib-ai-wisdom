    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 to 40 days (question resolves based on events between May 31 and July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Indian kinetic attacks in Pakistan proper are historically extremely rare",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Current tensions remain contained to disputed territories like Kashmir/LoC, diplomatic efforts succeed in de-escalation, or any military responses stay below the threshold of kinetic attacks in Pakistan's core provinces",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major terrorist attack or military provocation leads India to conduct retaliatory airstrikes or ground operations in Pakistani provinces like Punjab or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, similar to but more extensive than the 2019 Balakot strikes",
    "rationale": "The existence of a Wikipedia article titled '2025 India-Pakistan conflict' suggests elevated tensions or an ongoing crisis, which significantly increases the baseline probability. However, several factors constrain escalation to kinetic attacks in Pakistan proper: (1) Historical precedent shows extreme rarity - even during major crises (Kargil 1999, 2001-02 standoff, Mumbai 2008, Pulwama 2019), India avoided kinetic attacks in Pakistan's core provinces; (2) Both nations possess nuclear weapons, creating strong deterrence against major escalation; (3) International pressure would be intense following such actions; (4) The short 31-day window limits opportunities for crisis escalation. The 2019 Balakot airstrike represents the closest precedent, but was framed as targeting terrorist camps in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, not Pakistan proper. My forecast weighs the apparent ongoing conflict (pushing probability higher) against historical constraints and nuclear deterrence (keeping it moderate). I'm not higher because even with a conflict, escalation to Pakistan proper remains unlikely. I'm not lower because the Wikipedia reference suggests a real, ongoing situation. I would update higher with evidence of major terrorist attacks, India mobilizing for strikes, or inflammatory rhetoric from leadership. I would update lower with successful de-escalation or diplomatic breakthroughs.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack in Pakistan proper in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 India–Pakistan conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_conflict)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack on targets in one of the following provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nTo count, an attack must be [kinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_military_action), using explosive weaponry or physical violence. Non-kinetic actions such as a cyberattack would not count, even one resulting in deaths.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
