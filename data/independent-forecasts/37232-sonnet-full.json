  "information": "The most recent post on Virgin Galactic's News page was dated January 30, 2025. The post before that was from December 12, 2024. Over the 10 complete months leading up to May 2025, five months contained at least one post. There was a four-month gap in posts from August to October 2024, and a three-month gap from February to April 2025.\n\nVirgin Galactic announced it will release its financial results for the first quarter of 2025 on Thursday, May 15, 2025, followed by a conference call. The company's Q4 2024 earnings release on February 26, 2025, was not posted on the main News page, nor was the press release announcing the date for the Q1 2025 results. These communications were issued via the Investor Relations section and PR wires.\n\nThe company is in a flight hiatus, with no crewed flights scheduled until 2026. The next generation of spaceplanes, the Delta SpaceShip, began assembly in March 2025. Commercial flights for this new craft are planned to begin in mid-2026, with private astronaut flights following in the fall of 2026. According to a regulatory filing, Geode Capital Management LLC increased its stake in Virgin Galactic by 19.1% during the fourth quarter of 2024.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "33 days (outcome will be known on June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Virgin Galactic continues not posting on their News page through May 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic posts at least one update to their News page in May, possibly related to Q1 2025 earnings (scheduled for May 15), Delta SpaceShip assembly progress, or other company developments",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic continues its current posting hiatus through May 2025, extending the gap that began in February to at least four months, similar to the four-month gap seen from August to October 2024",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors no posting in May. Virgin Galactic hasn't posted since January 30, 2025, creating a nearly three-month gap through April. Historical patterns show irregular posting: over the 10 complete months before May 2025, only 5 months contained posts (50% rate), including a prior four-month gap in 2024. The current operational context reinforces this trend - the company is in a flight hiatus with no crewed flights until 2026, reducing newsworthy operational content. Critically, the Q4 2024 earnings release on February 26 was NOT posted on the main News page, suggesting the upcoming Q1 earnings on May 15 will likely follow the same pattern of being distributed through Investor Relations channels rather than the main News page. The Delta SpaceShip assembly that began in March could warrant an update, but given the company's recent posting behavior, this seems less likely than continued silence. My forecast is not higher because May is a full month and there remains some possibility of a significant announcement worthy of the News page. My forecast is not lower because the strong precedent of Q4 earnings not appearing on the News page, combined with the ongoing hiatus and current three-month gap, makes continued silence the most likely outcome. I would update higher (toward more certainty of no posts) if we confirmed that news items are systematically being routed only to Investor Relations, or lower if there were indications of major company announcements planned for May beyond routine earnings.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
