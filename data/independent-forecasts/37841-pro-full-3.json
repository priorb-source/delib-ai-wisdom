  "information": "On May 21, 2025, Kneecap member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (also known as Mo Chara) was charged with a terrorism-related offence under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charge relates to an allegation that he displayed a Hezbollah flag during a concert in London in November 2024. A court date at Westminster Magistrates' Court has been set for June 18, 2025, approximately one week before the Glastonbury festival is scheduled to begin. The band has publicly denied the charge, describing it as 'political policing'.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command is formally investigating the band over footage from two separate events. One investigation concerns a video from a 2024 concert where a band member allegedly said, 'The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.' Another investigation relates to a 2023 concert where a band member appeared to chant, 'up Hamas, up Hezbollah.' Following public backlash, the band issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess. Several UK politicians and government ministers have publicly called for Glastonbury to remove Kneecap from the festival's lineup.\n\nAs of late May 2025, Kneecap remains officially listed on the Glastonbury 2025 lineup for the West Holts stage, and festival organizers have not issued any public statement regarding the controversies or the recent charge. Several venues and European festivals, including the Eden Project, Plymouth Pavilions, and Germany's Hurricane and Southside festivals, have cancelled Kneecap's scheduled appearances. However, other events have proceeded; London's Wide Awake Festival confirmed the band would still perform on May 24, and the band played a surprise gig in London on May 22, the day after the terrorism charge was made public.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The festival is scheduled to run from June 25 to June 29, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. As of May 23, 2025, Kneecap remains on the official Glastonbury 2025 lineup published by the festival.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury organizers remove Kneecap from the lineup due to the significant legal and reputational risks. This decision is driven by a band member being charged under the Terrorism Act, sustained pressure from UK politicians, and the precedent of other venues cancelling the band's performances.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury organizers withstand the political and public pressure, reaffirming a commitment to freedom of expression. The court hearing on June 18 for the charged band member results in no bail conditions that prevent a performance, and the band plays their scheduled set.",
    "rationale": "The current status quo is that Kneecap is scheduled to perform. However, there are substantial factors making a cancellation more likely than not. The most significant development is the terrorism-related charge against band member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, with a court date just a week before the festival. This introduces a serious legal risk; potential bail conditions could directly prohibit the performance. This legal issue is compounded by active police investigations into the band and intense, public pressure from UK government ministers for their removal. Furthermore, a precedent for cancellation has been set, with several UK venues and major European festivals already dropping the band from their schedules. Weighing against this is Glastonbury's well-known counter-cultural ethos and historical resistance to censorship. The fact that organizers have not yet removed the band, despite the long-standing controversy, indicates a reluctance to bow to pressure. However, a formal charge under the Terrorism Act elevates the situation beyond political controversy to a matter of legal jeopardy. Therefore, I assess that cancellation is the more probable outcome. My forecast is not lower because Glastonbury's unique brand of defiance cannot be entirely discounted, and they may choose to make a stand. It is not higher because the combination of a specific terrorism charge, political condemnation, and a pattern of cancellations by other organizers presents a formidable set of obstacles. I would significantly increase my forecast if the charges were dropped or if Glastonbury's organizers issued a strong statement of support for the band.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 21, 2025, Kneecap member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (also known as Mo Chara) was charged with a terrorism-related offence under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
