  "information": "The Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which aims to ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program. The bill, authored by Senator Charles Perry and supported by Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, passed the Senate on May 7, 2025, with a 25-6 vote and was sent to the House State Affairs Committee. Proponents cite concerns over public health and safety regarding unregulated high-THC products. Lt. Gov. Patrick has stated he will push for a special legislative session if a ban is not passed during the regular session. The proposed law would make possession of consumable hemp products punishable by up to one year in jail and a $4,000 fine.\n\nThe Texas House of Representatives has shown resistance to a full THC ban, instead advancing measures to expand medical cannabis access. House Bill 46 (HB 46), which broadens the state's Compassionate Use Program, was approved by the House with a vote of 118-16. This bill expands the list of qualifying medical conditions, increases the number of licensed dispensaries to 11, and gives military veterans special access to low-dose THC treatments. Furthermore, a House committee adopted a substitute version of the Senate's SB 3 that is not a full ban, but would allow certain low-THC beverages and tinctures while prohibiting vapes and synthetics. The Texas hemp industry, estimated to be worth $8 billion, and Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller have expressed concerns that a total ban would shutter thousands of businesses.\n\nThe Texas Legislature's regular session is scheduled to end on May 26, 2025, leaving a narrow window for new legislation to pass through all required procedural steps in both chambers and be signed by the governor. While Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick has threatened to force a special session, only Governor Greg Abbott can officially call one and set its agenda. As of mid-May, Governor Abbott's stated public priorities for the session did not include a THC ban. Public opinion appears to favor more access; a University of Houston survey found that 62% of Texans support marijuana legalization and 79% support a comprehensive medical marijuana program. Veterans' groups have also testified in opposition to a ban, citing THC products as an alternative to opioids.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025. The Texas Legislature's regular session ends May 26, 2025, which is only 12 days away. Any legislation would need to pass both chambers and be signed by the governor within this narrow window, or alternatively pass during a special session if one is called before July 1.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Texas does not currently have a full ban on THC sales, and this would remain the case if no new legislation is enacted.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Texas House continues its resistance to a full ban, and the legislative session ends May 26 without reconciling the Senate's ban (SB 3) with the House's preference for expanded medical access (HB 46). The House substitute version of SB 3, which allows certain low-THC products rather than implementing a full ban, becomes the final result or no agreement is reached at all. Governor Abbott either does not call a special session, or if called, does not include a THC ban on the agenda.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The House reverses course and passes the Senate's full THC ban (SB 3) in its original form within the remaining 12 days of the regular session, and Governor Abbott signs it into law. Alternatively, Lt. Gov. Patrick successfully pressures Governor Abbott to call a special session focused on THC prohibition, both chambers pass a full ban during that session, and Abbott signs it before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The weight of evidence strongly favors the status quo (No outcome). Most critically, the Texas House has already demonstrated clear opposition to a full ban by: (1) advancing HB 46 which expands medical cannabis access with overwhelming support (118-16), and (2) adopting a House committee substitute of SB 3 that specifically avoids being a full ban. This institutional resistance from one chamber is a powerful signal. The timeline is extremely compressed with only 12 days remaining in the regular session. Passing controversial legislation typically requires extensive floor debate, amendment processes, and conference committee work to reconcile differences - unlikely to happen on this timeline given the fundamental disagreement between chambers. Economic factors create strong headwinds: the $8 billion hemp industry, thousands of businesses, and Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller's opposition suggest significant lobbying pressure against a full ban. Public opinion (62% support legalization, 79% support medical marijuana) further undermines political motivation. Governor Abbott has not publicly prioritized a THC ban, making it uncertain whether he would even sign such legislation or call a special session. While Lt. Gov. Patrick strongly supports a ban and threatens a special session, only the governor can call one and set its agenda. My forecast is not lower (5-10%) because: the Senate did pass SB 3 by a strong margin (25-6), showing real political will in that chamber; Lt. Gov. Patrick is actively pushing for this; and legislative surprises do occasionally happen, especially with determined leadership. My forecast is not higher (35-50%) because: the House has already clearly signaled its opposition through concrete legislative actions, not just rhetoric; the procedural timeline is prohibitively short; and the structural requirement for a special session (requiring Abbott's initiation and agenda-setting) adds another significant hurdle. To update higher, I would need to see: the House suddenly reversing course and advancing the full ban, Abbott publicly endorsing the ban, or concrete signs of a special session being planned with THC ban on agenda. To update lower, I would need: the regular session to end without passage, or Abbott explicitly ruling out a special session on this topic.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which aims to ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program.
