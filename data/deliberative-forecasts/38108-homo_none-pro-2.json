    "review": "The other two forecasters share my core reasoning: the primary tension is between the extremely short timeline and bureaucratic inertia versus the strong political incentive to post a large number. They both arrived at a slightly more skeptical forecast of 15%. I found two of their arguments particularly persuasive and additive to my own analysis. Forecaster 2 provided a useful base rate by comparing this effort to the GAO, which takes a full year to identify *potential* savings, highlighting the extraordinary speed required here. Forecaster 3 made an excellent point that I had not explicitly considered: the complete lack of any news, leaks, or pre-announcement hype is itself a bearish signal. A government on the verge of claiming such a massive success would likely be setting the stage for it in the media.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 20%, weighing the significant political incentive to 'claim' a large number against the massive bureaucratic and practical hurdles. After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I am updating my forecast downwards. The arguments that the lack of any positive news or leaks is a negative indicator, and that even politically-motivated claims need some time to build a credible foundation, are very compelling. The comparison to the GAO's year-long timeframe for simply identifying potential savings also reinforces how monumental a task achieving this would be in just a few months. These points have convinced me that I was slightly overweighting the 'political will' factor. The path to a 'Yes' outcome seems more difficult now than I initially assessed. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast from 20% to 15% to align with this more skeptical view, which still acknowledges the non-trivial possibility of a surprise political announcement.",
