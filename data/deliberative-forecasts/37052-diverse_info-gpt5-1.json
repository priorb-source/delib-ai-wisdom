    "review": "New information/arguments noted: (1) Forecaster 2 cites a foiled Burkina Faso attempt in April 2025. If accurate, that’s an immediate risk signal and supports a higher hazard in the Sahel. (2) They also anchor on a 2.5/year base rate and land at ~40%. (3) Forecaster 3 explicitly uses a Poisson with ~1.6/year to get ~25% for this ~66–67 day window, which matches the math (P>=1 = 1−e^(−λ)).\n\nAssessment: Forecaster 3’s reasoning is methodologically sound and consistent with the recent annualized success rate. Forecaster 2’s 40% seems high for a short window without specific, credible indications of an imminent plot; 40% implies λ≈0.51 for the window (equivalent to ~2.8 successful coups/year), which is hard to justify given the 2024 lull and the fact many high-risk states are already under juntas (reducing target-rich environments, though intra-junta coups remain possible). The Burkina April 2025 claim, if true, nudges risk up, but a foiled plot also evidences regime counter-coup capacity. Neither forecaster materially updates Latin America risk, which remains low absent concrete triggers.\n\nWhat I hadn’t foregrounded: the (reported) very recent Burkina signal. I still find 25% more defensible than 40% without corroborated, country-specific warning signs. I also factor in the imminent Chad election as a near-term trigger, which slightly raises risk versus a pure base-rate view.",
    "rationale": "I continue to weight Africa as the dominant contributor. Using a recent-success base rate of ~1.6–1.8/year for Africa yields λ≈0.29–0.33 over ~0.184 years and P>=1 ≈ 25–28%. Adjustments: + for near-term triggers (notably Chad’s early May election) and signs of persistent plotting (e.g., reports of a foiled plot in Burkina), − for the 2024 pause and consolidation under existing juntas (which can deter or detect plots). Latin America contributes a small tail (Venezuela, Bolivia) but with no clear imminent catalyst; I assign ~1–3% incremental risk.\n\nNetting these, I move modestly up from my prior 21% to 26%, closer to Forecaster 3’s base-rate Poisson, but still below 30% given the short window and lack of concrete, corroborated imminent-coup indications. I would update upward on credible reporting of elite splits or security force defections in Chad/Burkina/Guinea-Bissau/DRC, or signs of a self-coup in a country facing an immediate institutional crisis.",
