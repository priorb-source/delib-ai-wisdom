    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "He remains outside the U.S. while legal and administrative efforts continue or stall; no public, credible report of his entry occurs before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid, exceptional action occurs—e.g., DHS grants humanitarian parole, a court order compels/permits return, or consular/CBP processes are expedited—and credible media or official sources report his arrival in the U.S. before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "With roughly two months left, the default is that a recently deported individual does not re-enter the U.S. quickly. Even when there is public attention, reversals that culminate in physical return typically take longer than a few weeks due to legal, bureaucratic, and logistical hurdles (parole requests, waivers, travel docs, coordination with CBP). Clandestine re-entry would be unlikely to be publicly confirmed by credible sources in time to resolve the question as Yes. The existence of a dedicated Wikipedia page suggests notable attention, which slightly raises the chance of an exceptional, expedited remedy (e.g., humanitarian parole), but such outcomes are still uncommon and time-constrained. Research assistant provided no additional case-specific information, so I place extra weight on base rates: swift post-removal return within ~60 days is rare absent clear administrative error acknowledged by DHS or strong legal action. Why not higher: without concrete signals—ongoing litigation with imminent rulings, DHS statements of review, or congressional pressure yielding commitments—the probability of a rapid return before July 1 remains low. Why not lower: media attention and potential advocacy create a non-trivial tail for expedited parole or a court-facilitated return, which is small but real. What would move me up: credible reports that DHS is actively reconsidering and likely to grant parole; a court granting emergency relief that entails return; statements from officials or lawyers indicating travel is scheduled or authorized; prominent bipartisan political pressure. What would move me down: reports indicating legal avenues are deferred to longer timelines, explicit DHS refusals, or lack of movement by early June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kilmar Abrego Garcia return to the United States before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Kilmar_Abrego_Garcia)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kilmar Abrego Garcia after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of the United States according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nSubsequently leaving the United States, such as a deportation, will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
