    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days (from May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The tracker will have fewer than 120 objectives marked as 'Done' by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Implementation of Project 2025 objectives proceeds at a moderate pace, with legal challenges, bureaucratic obstacles, and competing priorities slowing progress. By July 1, only 80-100 objectives are marked as complete, primarily consisting of early appointees and initial executive orders. Many policy changes require regulatory processes or legislation that extend beyond the July deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration aggressively implements Project 2025 recommendations from day one. Many objectives are quick wins (appointments, executive orders, policy reversals) completed in the first 4 months. By mid-May, 90-110 objectives are already done, and the remaining weeks see an additional 10-30 completed. The tracker maintainers mark items as 'Done' liberally when significant progress is demonstrated.",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces significant uncertainty due to lack of current tracker data. Critical unknowns include: (1) the total number of objectives tracked, (2) how many are currently marked as 'Done' as of mid-May, and (3) the criteria used by tracker maintainers to classify items as complete. We're approximately 4 months into the administration with 6.5 weeks remaining until resolution. Early months typically see the most rapid policy action through appointments and executive orders, but substantial policy changes require longer implementation periods. The Keep_Track subreddit community is known for careful, critical tracking of political developments, suggesting they may apply rigorous standards for marking objectives as 'Done.' If 120 represents 15-25% of total objectives (assuming 500-800 total), this is an ambitious target requiring sustained, aggressive implementation. Status quo bias suggests caution: governments typically move slowly, and comprehensive policy agendas face inevitable obstacles. My forecast is not higher because: (1) lack of evidence about current completion rates, (2) typical policy implementation timelines extend beyond 4.5 months, (3) potential for stringent 'Done' criteria by tracker maintainers. My forecast is not lower because: (1) early administration periods see concentrated action, (2) some objectives may be easily accomplished, (3) 6.5 weeks allows time for additional completions. I would update upward with evidence showing 100+ objectives already completed or rapid recent completion rates. I would update downward with evidence of slow progress, high completion standards, or current counts far below 120.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it is less than 120, this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
