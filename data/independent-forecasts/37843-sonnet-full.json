  "information": "According to reports from sources including The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Ars Technica in March 2025, Discord is planning an initial public offering (IPO) for 2025. The company is reportedly in discussions with investment banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase to prepare for a potential listing. While some sources describe the talks as exploratory, others mention the hiring of a new CEO with IPO experience as a signal of late-stage readiness. Discord's valuation was estimated at approximately $15 billion in 2021, and it has over 200 million monthly active users.\n\nDiscord had previously considered going public in 2021 but postponed those plans due to market volatility. That same year, Microsoft offered to acquire Discord for $10 billion, but the company's leadership rejected the offer and a potential IPO was considered as an alternative. Responding to the recent 2025 IPO reports, a Discord spokesperson stated that the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. Discord's revenue is generated through a 'freemium' model, selling subscriptions for premium features.\n\nThe environment for technology IPOs in 2025 is described with mixed signals. Some reports mention a favorable IPO window, noting that other tech firms like CoreWeave, Klarna, and Figma have recently filed to go public. Other reports highlight market volatility, pointing to a recent 7-8.7% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and uncertainty surrounding Fed rate and trade policies as potential headwinds for companies considering a public launch.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "39 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement is made. Discord continues internal IPO preparations but does not formally announce plans via S-1 filing or website announcement before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discord continues working with investment banks but market volatility from the recent Nasdaq drop causes them to delay the formal announcement. Internal preparations extend beyond July 1, or they decide to announce later in 2025 after the July 1 deadline passes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Discord files an SEC Form S-1 in the next few weeks as part of accelerated IPO preparations, or makes a formal announcement on their news section confirming specific IPO plans before July 1, capitalizing on the momentum from other tech IPOs like CoreWeave, Klarna, and Figma.",
    "rationale": "The question requires a formal announcement before July 1, 2025 - just 39 days away. While March 2025 reports from credible sources indicate Discord is actively planning an IPO with Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase, and hired a CEO with IPO experience, no formal announcement has been made in the 2+ months since those reports. Critically, Discord's spokesperson declined to comment on the speculation, suggesting they're not ready to go public with an announcement yet. The status quo strongly favors no announcement - companies can work toward IPOs for extended periods without formal public declarations, and most things don't happen on compressed timelines. Working against a Yes outcome: the short 39-day window, market volatility (recent 7-8.7% Nasdaq drop), no announcement despite prior momentum, and typical corporate caution about public commitments. Working toward a Yes outcome: credible reports of 2025 target, engagement with major banks, other tech firms successfully filing recently, and 39 days being theoretically sufficient for an S-1 filing. The resolution criteria are narrow - just requiring an announcement of plans, not the actual IPO. However, even planning companies often wait until very close to filing before announcing. Given the lack of movement in 2+ months, deteriorating market conditions, and strong status quo bias, I estimate roughly 25% probability. This would increase significantly if: Discord announces CEO comments about timing, S-1 preparation leaks emerge, or market conditions stabilize. It would decrease if: more time passes without news, market volatility increases, or Discord makes statements suggesting delay.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to reports from sources including The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Ars Technica in March 2025, Discord is planning an initial public offering (IPO) for 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
