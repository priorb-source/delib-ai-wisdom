    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical methodological concern I underweighted: whether the Global Protest Tracker will create NEW ENTRIES for protests occurring in the question period, or simply consolidate them under a December 2024 anti-government protest wave entry. This is crucial because the resolution depends on GPT 'reporting a protest...with a start date' in the specified window, not just whether large protests occur. Forecaster 3 correctly notes that GPT 'typically catalogs major protest waves rather than every large rally' and may view current mobilizations as part of the late-2024 episode. This substantially narrows the resolution pathway compared to my initial analysis, which focused too heavily on whether protests would occur rather than how GPT would categorize them. However, Forecaster 3 may be too pessimistic. The research assistant reports multiple protests that have already occurred (Jan 4: 35k, Feb 2: 38-100k, Feb 15: 300k, Mar 29: 12k) which could still be added to GPT with appropriate start dates. Additionally, with the June 3 election approaching and two months remaining, new catalyzing events could trigger protests that GPT treats as distinct from the December 2024 wave - such as election disputes, new scandals, or labor actions on different issues. Forecaster 2's analysis is close to my original reasoning but doesn't address the GPT methodology question. The key uncertainty is whether GPT has already created a consolidated December 2024 entry that will absorb all subsequent anti-Yoon protests, or whether it will recognize distinct phases/events with separate start dates.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I need to update downward significantly because of the GPT methodology concern, but not as low as 34%. My revised reasoning: (1) Major protests have demonstrably occurred in 2025 that meet the threshold, which GPT could still report with start dates in the question period; (2) The June 3 election and ongoing political volatility create multiple pathways for new protest waves that GPT might treat as distinct events; (3) Labor actions or other movements beyond anti-Yoon protests could generate separate entries; (4) However, there's substantial uncertainty about whether GPT will consolidate protests under a single Dec 2024 entry rather than creating new entries. The balance of evidence suggests better than even odds that GPT will report at least one qualifying protest, but the methodological uncertainty prevents confidence above 75%. I'm updating to 70%, acknowledging the legitimate concerns about GPT's categorization practices while maintaining that multiple pathways exist and significant time remains for distinct protest events that warrant separate treatment.",
