    "no_outcome_scenario": "A new administration, in power since January 2025, either does not prioritize breaking up NOAA in its first five months or takes only preliminary steps, such as signing an initial executive order or introducing legislation. The editors of the tracker spreadsheet consider these actions insufficient to mark the objective as 'complete', and the status remains 'in progress' or something similar when the resolution date arrives.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A new administration makes breaking up NOAA a top 'Day One' priority. A sweeping executive order or a rapidly passed piece of legislation is enacted which is seen as effectively accomplishing the goal. The editors of the Project 2025 Tracker interpret this action as definitive and final, and they update the status in the spreadsheet to 'complete' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the immense procedural and political difficulty of dismantling a major federal agency within an extremely short timeframe. The question resolves on July 1, 2025, which gives a new administration, inaugurated on January 20, 2025, just over five months to complete this objective.\n\n1.  **Status Quo:** The current status is 'in progress'. The world, especially large government bureaucracies, changes slowly. The most likely outcome is that this status persists, as any action taken would represent the beginning of a long process, not its completion. \n\n2.  **Scale of the Task:** The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is a large, complex agency with a multi-billion dollar budget and thousands of employees. 'Breaking it up' would require significant legislative action to reassign its statutory duties and funding streams to other departments. This is not something that can be accomplished quickly or by executive fiat alone without facing immediate and significant legal challenges.\n\n3.  **Timeline:** A five-month timeline is highly unrealistic for passing the required legislation and completing the necessary bureaucratic reorganization. A new administration has many competing priorities in its first 100 days, and it is unlikely this specific, complex task would be fully completed ahead of all others.\n\n4.  **Resolution Criteria:** The question hinges on the judgment of the subreddit community managing the tracker. They are unlikely to mark such a far-reaching objective as 'complete' based on preliminary actions. Completion would imply the breakup is an accomplished fact, not just an initiated process. \n\nGiven these factors, the probability is very low. My forecast is not zero because there is a small chance that a new administration could take a legally aggressive 'shock and awe' approach with an executive order so sweeping that the tracker editors might, perhaps prematurely, judge it as 'complete'. My forecast is not higher because the practical, legal, and political obstacles to achieving this goal in five months are enormous. I would raise my probability if there were credible reports of pre-drafted legislation with overwhelming support ready for immediate passage after the inauguration. I would lower it if the administration's stated priorities for its first 100 days failed to mention this objective.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
