  "information": "National polling data shows the Conservative party with a 22% approval rating, while Reform UK is polling at 25% and the Liberal Democrats at approximately 14-16%. In the 2024 UK general election, the Liberal Democrats regained the constituencies of North Cornwall and St Ives. Political analyst Professor John Curtice has noted that the surge in support for Reform UK is likely to split the right-wing vote, which could indirectly benefit the Liberal Democrats.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days. The 2025 Cornwall Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025, and today is April 21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Liberal Democrats currently hold the most seats on Cornwall Council following the 2021 election, representing the baseline outcome if voting patterns remain similar.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK's national surge at 25% translates effectively to Cornwall Council seats, winning the most seats directly or splitting Conservative votes so severely that Independents (who are traditionally strong in Cornwall) end up with the plurality. Alternatively, a combination of multiple smaller parties and Independents collectively win more seats than the Liberal Democrats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Liberal Democrats maintain their historical strength in Cornwall, leveraging their incumbency advantage, strong local organization, and recent momentum from winning North Cornwall and St Ives in the 2024 general election. The Conservative collapse (22% approval nationally) combined with Reform UK splitting the right-wing vote benefits the Liberal Democrats, who consolidate the anti-Conservative vote in their traditional strongholds.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome - the Liberal Democrats currently control the most seats from 2021. Cornwall has distinctive political characteristics with strong Liberal Democrat tradition and organization. Their 2024 general election success in the region (regaining North Cornwall and St Ives) demonstrates continued electoral strength. The Conservative party's 22% national approval rating indicates severe weakness, while Reform UK's 25% polling creates a split right-wing vote that typically benefits Liberal Democrats in multi-way contests. However, several factors prevent a higher forecast: Reform UK's local council performance is uncertain and could directly win seats rather than just splitting votes; Independents traditionally perform well in Cornwall local elections and could win a plurality; national polling at 14-16% for Liberal Democrats suggests limited growth potential; and local issues could override national trends. The forecast isn't lower because: Liberal Democrats have incumbency advantage; they have proven recent success in Cornwall; Conservative weakness is severe and well-documented; and Cornwall's political culture historically favors them. To update higher, I'd need: Cornwall-specific polling showing Liberal Democrat strength, evidence Reform UK support doesn't translate to council seats, or clear tactical voting patterns. To update lower: evidence of strong Independent campaigns winning multiple wards, Reform UK winning council seats directly, or Liberal Democrat-specific local scandals.",
