  "information": "As of April 30, 2025, the official UN OCHA impact snapshot reported 295 UN staff fatalities in Gaza. Reports from late April cited UNRWA stating that 295 of its personnel had died since October 7, 2023. This number reflects a steady increase over time; a UN report on March 19, 2025, had stated at least 280 UN employees were killed, and an OCHA report cited on January 9, 2025, listed 263 UNRWA staff fatalities. Broader figures for humanitarian workers indicate a higher total toll; an OCHA report on April 23, 2025, stated that at least 418 humanitarian workers, including the 295 UN staff, had been killed in Gaza since the conflict began. A specific incident on March 23, 2025, resulted in the deaths of 15 humanitarian personnel, including staff from the Palestinian Red Crescent and one UN staff member.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months, with the resolution date being July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recent report from April 30, 2025, lists 295 fatalities, which is below the threshold of 300.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A significant de-escalation of the conflict or a durable ceasefire is implemented in May or June 2025. This leads to improved safety for aid workers, and fewer than 5 additional UN staff fatalities are recorded before the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The conflict continues with a similar intensity to previous months. The ongoing dangers from airstrikes, ground combat, and the breakdown of public order result in at least 5 more UN staff deaths being reported by OCHA before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The current reported number of UN staff fatalities is 295, which is only 5 short of the 300 threshold. The historical data provided indicates a consistent and tragic increase in this number over time. The count rose from 263 on January 9, 2025, to 280 by March 19, and then to 295 by April 30. This last increase of 15 registered fatalities over a 42-day period represents an average rate of approximately 0.36 deaths per day. If this trend continues, even at a quarter of its recent pace, the threshold of 300 would be surpassed well before the July 1, 2025, deadline. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the continuation of hostilities, which makes the accumulation of 5 more fatalities over nearly two months highly probable. \n\nMy forecast is not higher than 90% because there remains a non-trivial possibility of a ceasefire or a significant de-escalation being negotiated and implemented before the deadline. International pressure to protect humanitarian workers could also lead to improved operational safety, slowing the rate of casualties to fewer than 5 before July 1. \n\nMy forecast is not lower because the 'No' outcome requires a near-total halt to UN staff fatalities for the entire two-month period. Given the low threshold to be met (5 deaths) and the persistent dangers of the conflict zone, a continuation of the established trend is far more likely than a sudden and complete cessation of such incidents. \n\nI would lower my forecast significantly upon the announcement and implementation of a credible, lasting ceasefire. Conversely, I would raise my forecast following reports of a major escalation or a mass-casualty event involving UN personnel.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025. For example, a snapshot dated April 30, 2025, [reports](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-30-april-2025) 295 UN staff fatalities.\n\nIf OCHA stops posting new updates, this resolves as the most recent number, which as of the time of this question would be the impact snapshot posted on April 30, 2025.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of April 30, 2025, the official UN OCHA impact snapshot reported 295 UN staff fatalities in Gaza.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
