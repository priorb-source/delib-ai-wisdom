    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, the 50% tariff on certain goods from Lesotho, which resulted from an apparent clerical error in a 2018 presidential proclamation, is believed to still be listed in the US Harmonized Tariff Schedule.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. Trade Representative, or the White House, prioritizes and completes the administrative process to correct the long-standing and well-documented error, issuing a proclamation that removes the 50% tariff from the schedule before June 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Bureaucratic inertia prevails. The issue, which has a negligible direct impact on US trade, remains a low priority for the administration. No action is taken, and the erroneous tariff provision remains listed in the schedule on June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The core of this forecast rests on the principle of bureaucratic inertia, especially over a short time frame. The erroneous 50% tariff on Lesotho has been in place since 2018. Despite media reports (like the AP's in 2020) highlighting the absurdity of the situation—applying a national security tariff to a tiny, non-steel-producing nation—it has persisted for over six years, including the entirety of the current administration so far. This demonstrates a powerful status quo. For the outcome to be 'No,' the US government would need to complete the process of issuing a new presidential proclamation or a similar formal correction and have it reflected in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). With only about five weeks until the resolution date, the window for such an action to be initiated and finalized is extremely narrow. My research assistant's report of 'no additional information' reinforces this, as there are no public signals that a change is imminent. The primary reason my forecast is not higher than 95% is to account for the small possibility that a correction is already in the final stages of the administrative process and will be published unexpectedly before the deadline. The forecast is not lower because the lack of significant economic or political pressure makes it highly improbable that this obscure issue would suddenly become a priority and be resolved in such a short period.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Lesotho as 50% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [How tiny Lesotho ended up with the highest US tariffs in the world](https://apnews.com/article/lesotho-us-trump-tariffs-b337efa47290e889aa076cc9ede7bc9d)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 50% for Lesotho at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=lesotho) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
