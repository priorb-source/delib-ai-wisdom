    "review": "The deliberation was highly valuable, introducing critical new information. Forecaster 2 correctly highlighted the company's worsening financial state with Q1 2025 data, such as a negative gross margin, which initially suggested my own forecast might be too low. However, Forecaster 3 provided the decisive piece of evidence: a new $100 million financing facility secured on May 7, 2025. This information directly counters the immediate bankruptcy risk. Forecaster 3's reasoning is the most convincing because this new capital is a specific, deliberate action by management to ensure operational solvency through the near-term, making a bankruptcy filing before the July 1 deadline extremely unlikely. Forecaster 2's concerns, while valid in a vacuum, are effectively rendered moot for this short-term forecast by the new financing.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. My initial reasoning was that Beyond Meat likely had a sufficient cash runway to last the seven weeks until the resolution date. The deliberation has strongly reinforced this conclusion with new, concrete evidence. While Forecaster 2 correctly pointed to alarming Q1 2025 results that signaled deepening distress, Forecaster 3's introduction of the new $100 million senior secured financing facility is the most critical factor. This capital infusion, explicitly secured to provide a liquidity bridge, makes a bankruptcy filing before July 1, 2025, highly improbable. The act of securing such financing is fundamentally inconsistent with a plan to file for bankruptcy in the immediate future. The company now has a clear path to funding its operations well beyond the resolution date. My forecast remains at 5% to account for residual, low-probability risks such as a sudden catastrophic event like a major product recall, the discovery of fraud, or a technical breach of the new loan's covenants, but the primary risk of a near-term liquidity crisis has been effectively mitigated.",
