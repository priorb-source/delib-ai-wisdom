    "review": "Both analyses are reasonable and largely align with my priors. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the strategic case for a May announcement and interprets “early summer” as post–solstice, which I find too literal; politicians often use “early summer” loosely. Their point about a two‑month exploratory window being short is valid but less binding for a recent statewide candidate with existing infrastructure. Forecaster 3’s weighting of typical exploratory lengths and Osborn’s prior July announcement is persuasive and closer to my view; their invocation of meteorological summer to accommodate a late‑May move feels like a stretch, but it underscores the ambiguity in Osborn’s phrasing. Importantly, neither adds concrete signals (e.g., event bookings, principal campaign committee filings, or sourced reporting) that would materially shift the base case.",
    "rationale": "The base case still favors No: Osborn only launched an exploratory in early April; exploratory phases commonly last 3–6 months; his 2024 pattern and his stated “decide by early summer” both point to June/July timing, which is just after the June 1 deadline. Countervailing factors (pressure from Trump’s endorsement, desire to shape the narrative, and the ability to leverage 2024 infrastructure for a quicker pivot) keep a nontrivial chance of a May announcement, but absent concrete signs of imminent launch, those remain speculative. Given no new hard evidence, I’m maintaining my prior. I would move up on credible reports of a May event or FEC committee activation; I would move down on explicit June/July guidance or continued “testing the waters” posture into mid‑May.",
