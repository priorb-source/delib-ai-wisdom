    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — she remains outside Bangladesh (likely in India) through June 30, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "She continues residing in India under protection while legal cases and political risks in Bangladesh persist; no extradition moves conclude in time; no concrete safe-passage deal emerges; June ends without a verified entry into Bangladeshi territory reported by credible sources.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "She either voluntarily returns with a publicly announced itinerary and negotiated legal assurances, or India facilitates/pressures a handover or expulsion that results in her entering Bangladesh before July 1, with credible media/government reporting confirming her presence.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: The resolution window is narrow (May 13–June 30, ~7 weeks). Diplomatic/legal processes (e.g., extradition) rarely conclude this quickly, especially for a high-profile former PM.\n- Status quo inertia: Since her ouster and departure, she has remained outside Bangladesh. Exiled leaders typically return after months or years, not weeks, unless there is a clear, negotiated path and security guarantees. No such concrete arrangement is publicly evident.\n- Incentives and risks: Returning now likely entails immediate arrest and/or intense security risks under the current authorities. Unless there is an explicit safe passage or bail arrangement, the downside for her is large. That discourages a rapid return despite public vows.\n- India’s role: If she is in India, New Delhi is unlikely to rapidly extradite or expel her absent a compelling shift. Cross-border legal coordination normally takes longer than a few weeks.\n- Signaling vs. action: The cited Firstpost piece indicates she has vowed to return, but that is cheap talk without logistics, dates, or agreements. A high-profile figure cannot re-enter clandestinely without credible reporting; a return would almost certainly be widely covered, satisfying the resolution criterion.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information provided beyond the article context. Lacking evidence of imminent travel arrangements or a negotiated deal, the base case is that she does not return in this window.\nWhy not higher: No concrete travel plans, legal assurances, or bilateral moves are visible; extradition in <2 months is unlikely; security/legal risks for her remain high.\nWhy not lower: She has openly vowed to return; unforeseen political shocks or a tactical deal (e.g., time-limited safe passage, medical/family pretext) could materialize; a sudden Indian policy shift is low probability but nonzero.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of a set return date, flight/land border logistics, new legal guarantees (bail/safe passage), or India–Bangladesh agreement on her status; visible Awami League mobilization coordinated around her return.\nWhat would move me down: New arrest warrants/charges or Interpol actions; explicit Indian denial of travel or strong statements from Dhaka rejecting any safe passage; tightening security measures indicating her immediate arrest upon entry.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sheikh Hasina return to Bangladesh before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFirstpost: [Bangladesh has turned into a ‘terrorist country’: Sheikh Hasina targets Yunus, vows to return](https://www.firstpost.com/world/bangladesh-has-turned-into-a-terrorist-country-sheikh-hasina-targets-yunus-vows-to-return-13878191.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sheikh Hasina after May 12, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of Bangladesh according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nThe circumstances of her entering Bangladeshi territory, whether voluntarily or due to her extradition from India, will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
