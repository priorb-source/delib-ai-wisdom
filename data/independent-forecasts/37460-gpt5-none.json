    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No distinct new mass movement emerges in May–June; authorities keep tight restrictions on large gatherings (e.g., Gezi anniversary, Pride, labor actions) so any events remain dispersed and below 10,000 at a single time/place or are treated as continuations of earlier movements. The Global Protest Tracker (GPT) adds no new Turkey entry with a start date in this window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A large, clearly new wave begins after May 7, 2025—e.g., a major government decision/economic shock or a regional trigger (escalation in Gaza/Rafah) sparks a mass rally of 10,000+ in Istanbul/Ankara organized by opposition groups or pro-government/Islamist networks. Media coverage is substantial enough that GPT creates a new Turkey entry with participant band 10,000+ and a start date in May–June 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Time window is short (~7 weeks). Good forecasters give weight to the status quo: at present there is no qualifying entry in GPT, and large new movements in Turkey are infrequent under current repression.\n- Key constraint is not just occurrence but GPT’s curation practice. GPT typically records distinct protest movements with a single start date; large one-off or annual events (e.g., Pride, Gezi commemorations, routine labor rallies) are less likely to be listed as new entries. If mass Gaza-related rallies occur, they may be considered part of the 2023–2024 protest wave, which would not meet the “start date after launch” criterion.\n- Baseline for 10,000+ protests in Turkey over any random 2-month window is moderate given population and mobilization capacity, but the added filter that GPT must create a new entry meaningfully lowers the chance.\n- Potential upside catalysts: sharp economic deterioration, a high-salience domestic shock (e.g., disaster, scandal), or a major regional trigger prompting a permitted mega-rally. Any credible call for a mass rally in Yenikapı/Taksim that garners national coverage would raise odds substantially.\n- Downside factors: continued protest bans and dispersals (especially in central Istanbul), fragmentation across locations keeping headcounts below 10,000 per event, and GPT’s slower update cadence and preference for sustained movements.\n- Research assistant provided no extra info; thus this forecast leans on base rates, known protest calendar items (Gezi anniversary in late May, Pride in late June), Turkey’s policing environment, and GPT’s historical coverage patterns.\n- Why not higher: short horizon; requirement for a new GPT-listed movement; state repression; GPT update/selection bias against annual or continuation events.\n- Why not lower: Turkey remains prone to rapid mass mobilization when triggers arise; late May/June have dates that can catalyze large gatherings; a single large permitted rally would suffice if GPT treats it as a new movement.\n- Updates: I would raise the probability if there are credible announcements of nationwide demonstrations or government-sanctioned mass rallies, signs of a fresh protest wave (distinct framing from prior movements), or evidence that GPT has recently been adding 2025 entries for comparable countries/events. I would lower it if the period passes without large calls to mobilize or if GPT shows no 2025 additions for similar events elsewhere, implying stricter curation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 Turkish protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Turkish_protests)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nPlease note that the Global Protest Tracker uses the name Türkiye in its database.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
