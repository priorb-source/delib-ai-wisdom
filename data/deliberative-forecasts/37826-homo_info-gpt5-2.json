    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds several escalatory policy steps (Indus Waters suspension, Attari–Wagah closure, SAARC visa ban) and asserts “Operation Sindoor/Sundar” included strikes in Pakistan proper. If accurate, that would signal higher Indian willingness to hit beyond AJK/GB and raise the hazard. However, these claims weren’t in the RA summary; absent strong sourcing, I treat them as plausible but not confirmed. F2’s important and convincing point is the attribution criterion: BSF/Rangers exchanges wouldn’t count unless the Indian Armed Forces (Army/IAF/IN) are clearly responsible. I think F2’s 30% overweights recent escalation and underweights the announced May 10 ceasefire, pullback by end-May, and the narrow June window without a new trigger.\n\nForecaster 3 contributes useful, specific indicators: a diplomatic blitz (May 21–Jun 5), PM’s tougher doctrine, and reported delegation of retaliatory authority to Western Command. Those make a rapid cross-IB Army response to violations in the Punjab/Working Boundary sectors more plausible, nudging risk up. At the same time, the diplomatic push and reaffirmed ceasefire dynamics argue for restraint absent a major provocation. F3’s focus on attribution and geography is strong, and their 15% feels closer to my prior than F2’s 30%.\n\nNet: I find F3’s reasoning more persuasive overall; F2’s BSF/attribution caveat is valuable, but I’m cautious about uncorroborated escalatory claims. I’ll adjust slightly upward to reflect the possibility of an Army-led cross-IB retaliatory strike in June if the ceasefire frays, but keep the forecast well below 20%.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~9 days until the June window opens and 39 days until resolution. Status quo outcome if nothing changes: No.\n\nCeasefire/posture: The May 10 DGMO ceasefire and reported plan to withdraw to pre-conflict positions by end-May point to de-escalation as the default. International pressure to sustain calm after early-May exchanges remains high.\n\nPathways to Yes: (1) A mass-casualty attack in India in late May/June credibly attributed to Pakistan-based groups, prompting a Balakot-style punitive strike into KP or Punjab; (2) significant ceasefire violations along the International Border/Working Boundary leading to an Indian Army retaliatory strike (artillery, ATGMs, loitering munitions) that lands in Pakistani Punjab; (3) high-value target intelligence in Pakistan proper prompting a discrete stand-off strike. The reported delegation of authority to Western Command marginally increases pathway (2), shortening decision timelines.\n\nConstraints: Most routine firing occurs on the LoC into Pakistan-administered Kashmir (excluded). Along the IB, day-to-day engagements are typically BSF vs Pakistan Rangers; unless the Indian Army/IAF is clearly responsible, those would not count. New Delhi has incentives to bank deterrence gains from early May and pivot to diplomatic/economic pressure, especially given the recent ceasefire and outreach to foreign capitals. Absent a major trigger, the marginal utility of a new Pakistan-proper strike in June is low relative to risks.\n\nUpdate: Relative to my prior 9%, I’m nudging up to reflect (a) potential Army-led rapid retaliation authority in IB sectors and (b) the fact that even a brief, localized cross-IB Army strike would satisfy the resolution. I’m not adopting F2’s higher view because the ceasefire is holding for now, de-escalatory steps are underway, and there are no concrete indicators of imminent June action. If verified reports emerge of substantial IB violations, unusual IAF posturing/NOTAMs, or a major terror incident with attribution, I would move materially higher; conversely, if pullbacks finish and quiet holds through early June, I would drift lower toward high single digits.",
