    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 largely align with my base-rate framing and emphasize small-town recall dynamics: low-turnout advantages for motivated recall proponents, the significance of the recall qualifying, and incumbency/personal-network counterweights. They add a useful decision trigger set (charges, endorsements, ballot returns), but no new concrete evidence. Their emphasis on the plausible absence of criminal charges as a meaningful mitigating factor is the most salient addition; if charges haven’t materialized by now, that slightly improves Metz’s retention odds. Overall, their 40% retains seems reasonable but still within the same uncertainty band I had, given the severe allegation and tiny electorate volatility.",
    "rationale": "Starting from a ~40% survival base rate for local recalls that make the ballot, I still apply a negative adjustment for the unusually severe and salient allegation, which likely energizes recall supporters in a very small electorate. Countervailing factors include incumbency, personal relationships, and the apparent lack of criminal charges to date (if true), which can blunt the recall case. With eight days remaining and no fresh damaging developments reported, I modestly soften my earlier lean against retention, but keep it below 40% given the severity and the mobilization implied by a qualified recall in a tiny town. Key movers: Down if charges or damning new facts emerge, or signs of opposition-skewed turnout; up if clear exculpatory reporting, strong local endorsements, or broad turnout beyond the recall base materialize.",
