    "review": "Both forecasters make the same core case I did: summer seasonality plus concrete 2025 adds (Aegean ATH, Eurowings CGN) and the dense Turkey/Gulf/Saudi/Iran network push EBL toward the low-to-mid 30s. New/clarifying points I found useful: explicit mention of Damascus (Cham Wings) and Caucasus points (EVN, GYD, TBS/BUS) that typically appear in summer schedules, and the reminder that flightsfrom.com excludes ad‑hoc Hajj charters and can lag for very thin schedules. I’m less convinced than Forecaster 2 about easyJet ATH—this remains unlikely in my view and I wouldn’t count it. But their overall breadth check strengthens the >31 case. The risk framing (post‑Hajj thinning, episodic security suspensions) is sound and matches my concerns.",
    "rationale": "Net, I move slightly up. The additional enumeration of likely summer Caucasus and Turkish leisure points, plus the Syria service, makes ≥32 destinations by early July more plausible even if easyJet ATH doesn’t materialize. Eurowings CGN and Aegean ATH are meaningful incremental European points if they’re reflected on flightsfrom.com by July 1. The main downside risks remain: any late‑June suspensions or schedule pruning (especially Saudi or Turkish leisure) or announced routes not appearing on flightsfrom. Those risks keep me from going mid‑70s+, but the balance favors a Yes. I’m nudging up from 68% to 72%.",
