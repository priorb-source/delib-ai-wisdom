    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds concrete, recent steps I hadn’t explicitly factored: public consultation on a constitutional draft implicating self‑determination and new RS laws constraining state-level authorities. That’s a meaningful escalation beyond rhetoric and does marginally raise near-term tail risk. Their point that threats remain conditional—and that leverage may be more valuable than action—is also persuasive. I find their 28% a bit high given the red lines and Serbia’s likely caution, but their evidence argues for a modest upward revision.\n\nForecaster 3’s reasoning aligns with my prior view: long-standing brinkmanship patterns, severe and predictable international costs, Serbia’s reluctance to endorse a formal break, and Russia’s preference for managed instability. I agree with their emphasis that time isn’t the main constraint—political cost is. Their 10% feels slightly low given the recent institutional moves noted by Forecaster 2 and the low threshold for our resolution (any authorized RS body setting a date, even for later).",
    "rationale": "Netting the arguments, I modestly increase my forecast. The newly highlighted institutional preparation (constitutional consultation, restrictive laws) suggests higher willingness and capability to escalate procedurally, which slightly increases the chance of crossing the line to an official date announcement. However, core constraints remain: announcing a referendum would likely trigger immediate US/EU sanctions, jeopardize EU funds and BiH’s accession track, and put Belgrade in a bind. Historically, Dodik has extracted leverage without taking this specific, highly costly step, and making the referendum real reduces its value as a bargaining chip. Also, a formal scheduling probably requires an NSRS decision or another clearly authorized RS body—not just rhetoric—raising the threshold.\n\nTail risks to watch in the next ~60 days: an acute confrontation with the High Representative or state judiciary, arrests/legal steps against RS officials, or a political shock that incentivizes Dodik to announce a date (potentially timed around a symbolic window like Vidovdan on June 28). Conversely, visible pressure from Belgrade, fresh EU inducements, or RS fiscal stress signaling limited shock-absorption would reduce odds.\n\nGiven these offsets, I update from 15% to 18%, reflecting slightly elevated near-term hazard but maintaining a low overall likelihood that RS will officially schedule a referendum date before July 1, 2025.",
