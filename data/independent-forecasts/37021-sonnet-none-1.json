    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. We are currently on April 22, 2025, and April inflation data is typically published in early May with a delay of about 2-3 weeks after the month ends.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo suggests elevated inflation risks in Ukraine. The April 10, 2025 article indicates Ukraine is 'one step away from stagflation,' implying inflation is already high and potentially approaching the 15% threshold, though the exact current level is unknown.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine's April 2025 inflation rate remains below 15.0%, possibly due to: central bank interventions to stabilize prices, relative currency stability against expectations, temporary supply chain improvements, or effective government price controls on essential goods. The 'one step away from stagflation' warning proves premature, with inflation stabilizing in the 12-14% range.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine's April 2025 inflation reaches or exceeds 15.0% due to: continued war-related economic pressures, currency depreciation, energy and food supply disruptions, increased government spending creating inflationary pressure, or cumulative effects of sustained economic stress pushing inflation past the threshold indicated by the stagflation warning.",
    "rationale": "This question has very limited time uncertainty since we're already 22 days into April 2025, and the inflation data for this month essentially already exists - we're just awaiting official publication. The key evidence is the April 10, 2025 article stating Ukraine is 'one step away from stagflation.' Stagflation requires high inflation combined with stagnant growth. The phrase 'one step away' is ambiguous but suggests inflation is elevated and approaching critical thresholds. However, it could mean inflation is currently at 12-14% and rising toward 15%, or it could already be at or above 15%. Without access to recent inflation figures (February or March 2025), I must weigh this qualitative signal. Ukraine has faced sustained war-related economic pressures that typically drive inflation: supply disruptions, currency instability, reduced production capacity, and government spending. These structural factors support high inflation. My forecast is not higher (e.g., 75%+) because 'one step away' linguistically suggests not quite there yet, and if inflation were already clearly above 15%, the article might have stated it differently. My forecast is not lower (e.g., 40%) because the stagflation concerns are being raised in real-time during April 2025, suggesting the threshold is genuinely threatened. I would increase my forecast with evidence of: March 2025 inflation already at 13-14%+, sharp hryvnia depreciation in April, or energy price spikes. I would decrease it with: March 2025 inflation below 12%, successful stabilization measures, or contradictory economic data suggesting the article overstated risks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's inflation rate increase to at least 15.0% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's annualized inflation rate is greater than or equal to 15.0% for the month of April 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/inflation-cpi). Under 15.0% resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
