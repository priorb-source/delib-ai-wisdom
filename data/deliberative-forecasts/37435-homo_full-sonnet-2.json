    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I underweighted in my initial analysis. Their emphasis on the base rate for bankruptcy within a 57-day window is particularly strong - companies with several hundred million in cash, positive free cash flow, and no immediate debt obligations almost never file for bankruptcy this quickly, regardless of business model challenges. Forecaster 3's point about the process requirement is especially relevant: bankruptcy requires either inability to meet immediate obligations (which Chegg doesn't face) or a deliberate strategic board decision following extensive deliberation, which is unlikely to complete in 57 days while a strategic review is already underway exploring alternatives. I also may have overweighted the Altman Z-score relative to the hard liquidity constraints. While the -3.31 Z-score is severe and predictive of bankruptcy risk, it's a medium-term indicator, not a predictor of imminent filing within 8 weeks. The other forecasters' tighter clustering around 3-4% suggests I was an outlier, and their reasoning for why the timeline constrains probability is more rigorous than mine.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I gave insufficient weight to how constraining the 57-day timeline really is. Even severely distressed companies with existential business model threats typically have a multi-month process before bankruptcy filing when they maintain substantial cash reserves. Chegg's several hundred million in net cash and positive FCF create a meaningful buffer that would need to be exhausted or bypassed by a strategic decision. The Q1 results on May 12 could reveal deterioration, but even catastrophic results would leave only 50 days until July 1 - likely insufficient for a board to deliberate and execute a bankruptcy filing, especially while pursuing the strategic review. The strongest argument for maintaining some probability above 3-4% is the Altman Z-score of -3.31, which is deeply in distress territory and exists specifically to predict bankruptcy. This creates tail risk that even with cash, something could force or trigger an earlier-than-expected filing. However, balancing the strong base rate and timeline arguments against the severity of distress indicators, I should update downward significantly from 8%. A forecast of 5% acknowledges both the compelling timeline constraints and the genuine financial distress while remaining slightly above the other forecasters to account for the exceptional negativity of the Z-score.",
