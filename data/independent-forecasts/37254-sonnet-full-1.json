  "information": "The United States and Ukraine have signed an agreement establishing a fund for reconstruction and granting the US administration access to Ukraine's mineral resources, including rare earth minerals. In an official statement about the deal, the US Treasury Department mentioned the 'large-scale invasion' of Ukraine by Russia. In parallel, the US has urged both Russia and Ukraine to accept its peace proposal during a UN Security Council meeting. On February 24, 2025, the US voted against a UN resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukrainian territory, aligning with Russia and North Korea. The US presented an alternative resolution that called for a 'swift end' to the conflict without mentioning Russian aggression.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has issued warnings that Russia may be preparing a new wave of aggression under the guise of the upcoming 'West-2025' military exercises in Belarus. The potential targets mentioned in these warnings include a further invasion of Ukraine, or an attack on Lithuania or Poland. Zelensky stated that intelligence reports indicate Russia is building up its military forces in Belarus, with as many as 150,000 soldiers, for a potential invasion of a NATO country. In response, Ukraine's State Border Guard Service is closely monitoring the border with Belarus and tracking the movement of Russian units.\n\nRussia's recent history of military invasions includes Georgia in 2008, the annexation of Crimea and intervention in Eastern Ukraine in 2014, and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The US has historically been prompt in publicly accusing Russia of military aggression when it occurs. Currently, Russia's military remains heavily committed in Ukraine. Reports from various think tanks and news organizations, including RUSI, CSIS, Politico, and the BBC, do not indicate any new, significant Russian troop buildups for operations in countries other than Ukraine.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the US has not accused Russia of invading any country other than Ukraine, and maintaining this status quo is the most likely outcome",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia continues its military operations exclusively in Ukraine where its forces remain heavily committed. Even if Russia moves forces into Belarus or conducts other military activities, they either occur with government consent or the US chooses not to characterize them as invasions in public statements",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Russia sends ground forces into Lithuania, Poland, or another country without that government's consent, possibly under cover of the West-2025 military exercises in Belarus. The US quickly and publicly accuses Russia of invasion, similar to its historical pattern of prompt responses to Russian military aggression",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome for several reasons. First, the timeframe is extremely short - only 2 months - which is insufficient for planning and executing a major military operation of the scale required to invade another country. Second, Russia's military remains deeply committed in Ukraine, making a second front logistically and militarily challenging. Third, and critically, the research assistant's report indicates a significant shift in US policy toward Russia - the US voted against a UN resolution demanding Russian withdrawal from Ukraine and aligned with Russia and North Korea. This policy shift would make US accusations of Russian aggression LESS likely, not more. While President Zelensky has warned about potential Russian aggression toward NATO countries like Lithuania or Poland, citing 150,000 troops in Belarus, Ukrainian leadership has strong incentives to maintain Western focus on the Russian threat, so these warnings must be viewed in context. The research assistant notes that independent sources from RUSI, CSIS, Politico, and BBC do not corroborate significant Russian troop buildups for operations outside Ukraine. Historical base rates also favor No - even for Russia, major invasions are relatively rare events (2008, 2014, 2022). The forecast is not lower because Russia has demonstrated capacity for surprising military actions, and Putin has shown willingness to accept significant risks. The forecast is not higher because of the severe military constraints from Ukraine operations, the extremely short timeframe, lack of corroborating intelligence, and the apparent US policy shift away from confronting Russia. I would update higher with credible intelligence of massive troop movements, verification of Belarus buildup claims, or escalating Russian rhetoric. I would update lower with evidence of deepening Russian military exhaustion or diplomatic progress in Ukraine",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
