    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "38 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Uncertain - the New York Times article from April 4, 2025 indicates recent tariff announcements on Switzerland, but we don't know the current state of the harmonized tariff schedule",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The tariff rate listed on June 1 is different from 31% (either higher, lower, or not listed at all). This could occur due to: negotiations between the US and Switzerland leading to modifications, legal challenges delaying or changing implementation, Trump administration adjusting the rate as part of deal-making, or administrative delays in updating the official schedule.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The harmonized tariff schedule subheading 9903.01.60 shows exactly +31% additional ad valorem duty for Swiss products on June 1, 2025. This occurs if the Trump administration's announced tariffs are implemented as stated, without modification, delay, or successful Swiss negotiations to change the rate.",
    "rationale": "The April 4, 2025 NYT article indicates recent Trump administration action targeting Switzerland with tariffs, placing them in the 'top 10' of tariff targets. The question's extreme specificity about the 31% rate and subheading 9903.01.60 strongly suggests this rate has been announced or proposed. With 38 days until resolution, there's sufficient time for implementation if already announced. However, several uncertainties remain: (1) Tariff announcements don't always translate to exact implementation - rates can be modified during negotiations, (2) Switzerland is a significant trading partner with diplomatic leverage to negotiate changes, (3) The Trump administration has historically used tariffs as negotiating tools, sometimes backing down or modifying rates, (4) Legal or administrative delays could prevent the exact rate from appearing on the specific date, (5) The precision required (exactly 31%, not 30% or 32%) adds uncertainty. My forecast is not higher because: major tariff implementations face political and legal obstacles, negotiations with Switzerland could change the rate, and the exact precision required (31%) is difficult to guarantee. My forecast is not lower because: the recent NYT article confirms tariff activity, the question's specificity suggests real policy basis, and 38 days provides adequate implementation time. I would update higher with confirmation that 31% has been officially published in the schedule already, or lower with news of Swiss negotiations, legal challenges, or administrative delays.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tariff schedule list the tariff on Switzerland as 31% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Swiss Indignant to Make the Top 10 of Trump’s Tariffs List](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/trump-tariffs-switzerland.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 31% for Switzerland at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=switzerland) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this question is asking whether the cell in the 'RATES OF DUTY' column '1, General' appearing alongside subheading 9903.01.60 on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule indicates an additional ad valorem duty rate of 31% for articles the product of Switzerland, regardless of any specificities noted in the 'Article Description' column.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
