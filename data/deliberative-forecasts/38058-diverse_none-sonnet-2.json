    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I underweighted: the EXACT WORD requirement. Coverage could shift to synonyms like 'duties,' 'levies,' 'trade barriers,' or 'trade policy' without using 'tariff(s),' significantly increasing omission probability. Their probabilistic framework is also more rigorous - even if the per-day probability of both papers omitting is low (3-5%), over ~34 remaining days, the aggregated chance of at least ONE such day is substantial (1-(0.97)^34 ≈ 64%). Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes the broad resolution criteria (any mention counts, including summaries), making omission harder, but may overweight the status quo pattern. The key tension: tariffs ARE major news (supporting lower forecasts), but we only need ONE qualifying day out of 34, and exact wording matters (supporting higher forecasts). Topic rotation, synonyms, weekends, and major competing stories all create natural windows for omission.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating substantially upward based on three insights: (1) The exact word constraint is more restrictive than I initially weighted - papers can cover trade policy extensively without using 'tariff(s)'; (2) The mathematical framing clarifies we need just ONE day, not a pattern change; (3) Over 34 days, even pessimistic per-day probabilities (3-5% both omit) aggregate to 50-70%. However, I'm not going as high as Forecaster 3's 82% because: (a) tariffs remain extraordinarily salient in May 2025 with ongoing policy developments; (b) WSJ's business focus and 'What's News' section make the exact word more likely to appear; (c) the question implies recent pattern of at least one paper mentioning tariffs daily. Balancing the strong arguments for synonym usage and aggregation effects against current salience, I'm settling on 60%.",
