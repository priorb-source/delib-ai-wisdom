    "review": "Both forecasters’ reasoning is well-aligned with my priors: small, tightly regulated market; active government enforcement against illegal taxis; presence of local, government-aligned apps; and no visible pre-launch signals from Uber. I found Forecaster 3’s emphasis on the short runway especially apt, and I’d add that July is not TCI’s peak season, which further lowers the incentive for a near-term launch. The possibility of a fast “Uber Taxi” integration is the main upside tail they cite, but without any hints of regulatory engagement or partnership, it remains speculative. Overall, their arguments are convincing and slightly nudge me downward.",
    "rationale": "Status quo: Uber is not operating in TCI and the government is signaling strict enforcement against unlicensed taxis. Two local e-hailing services (GetMe Ride and newly launched Conch Cab) already operate, consistent with a policy preference for locally anchored, licensed solutions. Uber’s recent expansion pattern emphasizes larger markets or taxi integrations in bigger cities, not micro-markets like TCI. With only ~60 days to July 1 and no press, hiring, regulatory signals, or website artifacts, the odds of a compliant launch and listing by the resolution date are low. Additional consideration lowering my estimate: July is off-peak relative to TCI’s high season, reducing urgency for a rapid rollout. Also, the fresh May 2025 launch of Conch Cab suggests the government just endorsed/accepted a local solution, making an immediate pivot to invite Uber even less likely. Upside tail remains a swift Uber Taxi integration if the government and taxi associations actively solicit Uber, but there is no evidence of that yet. I’m trimming my forecast slightly from 7% to 6% to reflect the seasonality and the recency of the local app launch as marginally negative indicators.",
