    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Chegg continues to operate as a going concern and does not file for bankruptcy.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Chegg's leadership manages to stabilize the company's finances through cost-cutting, pivoting its business model, and leveraging its existing cash reserves. Despite significant business headwinds from AI competition, the company avoids a liquidity crisis and is not forced to seek bankruptcy protection before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A disastrous quarterly earnings report reveals a much faster-than-anticipated decline in subscribers and revenue, triggering a crisis of confidence among creditors. Unable to service its debt or secure new financing, the company's board makes a pre-emptive decision to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to restructure its operations and liabilities.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high inertia against a corporate bankruptcy filing over a very short time frame. The status quo for any publicly traded company is to not be in bankruptcy, and this is a strong prior. The deadline is less than two months away. While the provided Wall Street Journal article highlights the serious, long-term existential threat AI poses to Chegg's business model, a bankruptcy event typically requires an acute liquidity crisis—an inability to pay immediate obligations. Such a crisis rarely materializes without significant public warning signs, such as defaults on debt, failed financing rounds, or official company statements about exploring strategic alternatives. There are currently no such public indicators of an imminent filing. Chegg, despite its stock price decline, likely has sufficient cash reserves to continue operations for the next two months. My probability is not lower than 3% because the AI threat is real and accelerating, which could cause an unforeseen, rapid deterioration in financials or creditor confidence. A shocking earnings report or the announcement of a major debt default could trigger a filing. My probability is not higher because bankruptcy is a measure of last resort. For a company of this scale, the process leading to a filing is complex and would be unlikely to initiate and conclude within the short remaining window without more obvious signs of distress. I would increase my forecast probability upon news of a major credit downgrade, a default on debt covenants, or the sudden departure of the CEO or CFO. I would decrease it following a better-than-expected earnings report or the announcement of new financing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chegg file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWall Street Journal: [How ChatGPT Brought Down an Online Education Giant](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-chatgpt-brought-down-an-online-education-giant-200b4ff2)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Chegg, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
