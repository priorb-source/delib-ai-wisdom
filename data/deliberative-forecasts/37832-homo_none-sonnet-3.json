    "review": "All three forecasters have converged on very similar reasoning and probability ranges (8%, 8%, 10%), which increases my confidence in the analysis. Forecaster 3 raises an interesting distinction I hadn't emphasized: announcing they are 'planning' an IPO versus actually executing one. They could theoretically announce planning for a Q3/Q4 2025 IPO and still resolve as Yes. However, this doesn't materially change the calculus because the CEO's statement specifically referred to 'this year' (2025), not just the immediate future. Both other forecasters also acknowledge the possibility of confidential S-1 preparation, which I had considered but perhaps understated - companies can work on filings privately before announcement. The point about not knowing the exact date or full context of the CEO's statement is valid and introduces some uncertainty, though the article appears recent given the context. All three analyses appropriately weight the extremely short 40-day timeframe and lack of any positive evidence suggesting an imminent announcement against the small possibility of surprise corporate decisions or behind-the-scenes developments we're not privy to.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find strong convergence on both reasoning and probability assessment. The consensus reinforces my original analysis: the CEO's explicit statement against a 2025 IPO, combined with the compressed 40-day timeframe, creates a very strong case for No. While Forecaster 3's point about 'planning' versus 'executing' is technically correct, it doesn't change the fundamental barrier - the CEO dismissed the entire year 2025 for an IPO. The acknowledgment by all forecasters that we lack the precise date and full context of the CEO's statement is appropriate humility, but absent new information suggesting the statement is outdated or being reconsidered, it remains the strongest piece of evidence. The 8-10% probability range appropriately captures the inherent uncertainty in corporate decision-making and the theoretical possibility of confidential preparations or strategic reversals, while heavily weighting the clear public guidance and short timeframe. No compelling new evidence or arguments have emerged that would justify revising my forecast away from 8%.",
