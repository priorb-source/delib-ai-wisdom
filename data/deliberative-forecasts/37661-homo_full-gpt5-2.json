    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my view: licenses in hand, strong political will, ISL removes gateway dependency, and the key gating item is BTRC tariff/pricing approval. Forecaster 3 usefully emphasizes that any partial availability anywhere in Bangladesh would resolve the question, modestly raising odds. Forecaster 2 underscores that the map flips only when orders are enabled, which keeps the status-quo inertia in play. Neither adds new hard evidence, but the articulation of partial-coverage sufficiency and the crisp timeline (≈62 days from license to Jul 1) slightly strengthens the case for a narrow Yes within the window.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining (~46 days from May 16) is sufficient if tariff approval lands in late May or early June. With licenses granted and import permission included, plus demonstrated trials and public statements targeting May, the main uncertainty is procedural pace on tariffs and any ancillary device/type approvals and tax setup. Starlink’s ISL capability reduces infrastructure dependencies, supporting a fast flip once pricing is cleared. Countervailing risks are bureaucratic slippage, possible consumer protection/terms reviews, import logistics, and a long-tailed distribution of post-license activation timelines. The U.S. Senate inquiry likely has limited practical impact on Bangladesh’s timeline. Given that any availability anywhere in Bangladesh satisfies resolution, I edge up slightly from my prior 62% to 64%, reflecting a modest increase in confidence while still respecting the nontrivial risk of June slipping into July.",
