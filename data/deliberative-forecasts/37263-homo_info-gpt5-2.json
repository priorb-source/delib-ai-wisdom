    "review": "Both forecasters add useful, concrete points I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: (1) the presence of two local ride-hailing services (GetMe Ride since 2019 and Conch Cab launching May 2025), which suggests the regulatory niche is being served by local, likely compliant operators; and (2) the April 2025 government warning and fines against illegal taxis, reinforcing a protective enforcement posture. Their emphasis on the short 60-day window without preparatory signals (gov’t announcements, Uber listings, job postings, taxi-association MoUs) is aligned with my take. I find their reasoning convincing and consistent with base rates for Uber entering very small island markets on short timelines.",
    "rationale": "Status quo remains No. The most plausible Yes path is an Uber Taxi model integrating licensed taxis under regulatory blessing. Given the government’s recent crackdown messaging, taxi-industry influence, and the emergence/operation of local ride-hailing options, the incentive for regulators to accommodate Uber on a rush basis by July 1 appears low. The short timeline without visible signals (Uber newsroom, support page listing, local gov’t/taxi association communications, recruitment) further depresses odds. Uber’s current expansion priorities favor larger markets or structured partnerships already in motion, and TCI’s small scale makes a near-term pivot unlikely. I’m nudging my estimate slightly down because the new information about active local apps suggests the regulatory/market space is already occupied in a way that reduces marginal pressure to bring in Uber quickly. Update: from 5% to 4%. What would move me up: credible reports of a formal Uber–taxi association partnership or regulatory approval, Uber listing TCI on its site/app, or government statements inviting an e-hail pilot. What would move me down: explicit government/taxi-association opposition to ride-hail platforms or continued/enhanced enforcement rhetoric into June without any Uber signals.",
