    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling arguments. Forecaster 3's point about the research assistant reporting 'no additional information available' is particularly significant - this isn't just absence of evidence for an announcement, it's a positive signal that no preparation activities are visible. In modern politics, major campaign announcements rarely emerge without advance signals like staff hiring, fundraising setup, or media buzz. The complete absence of such signals with only 26 days remaining is more telling than I initially weighted. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize status quo bias in forecasting - things tend to remain as they are without clear catalysts. Forecaster 2's reasoning at 20% seems slightly optimistic given the complete absence of signals. Forecaster 3's 12% forecast acknowledges that while 26 days provides technical sufficiency for an announcement, the lack of any preparation indicators combined with unfavorable political dynamics (Trump backing rival, trailing in polls) makes this increasingly unlikely.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should update downward from my initial 15% forecast. The key factors pushing me lower are: (1) The research assistant's finding of 'no additional information' is a stronger negative signal than I initially weighted - if announcement preparations were underway, something would likely be visible; (2) Major campaign announcements require weeks of preparation that should be detectable by now; (3) The unfavorable political environment (Trump endorsing Byron Donalds, polling deficit) provides little incentive for her to enter; (4) As each day passes without signals, the status quo increasingly favors 'No'. However, I'm not going below 12% because 26 days remains technically sufficient for an announcement, and political surprises occasionally occur. I'm settling on 13% as a modest update downward that acknowledges the strength of Forecaster 3's arguments while maintaining some probability for unexpected developments.",
