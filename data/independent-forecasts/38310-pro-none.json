    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The summit is scheduled for June 2025 and today's date is June 3, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. President Zelenskyy will attend the summit. G7 nations are Ukraine's primary supporters, and President Zelenskyy has attended previous G7 summits in person to advocate for his country's needs. The invitation has been formally extended.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, major escalation in the war, such as a large-scale Russian offensive on a key city, requires President Zelenskyy to remain in Ukraine for command and morale purposes. Alternatively, a specific and credible security threat against his travel or his person at the summit forces him to cancel his in-person attendance.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The military situation in Ukraine remains intense but stable enough to permit his brief absence. Security arrangements provided by Canada and his own detail are deemed sufficient. He travels to Kananaskis to personally engage with G7 leaders, reinforcing alliances and securing commitments for aid.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly supports a 'Yes' outcome. President Zelenskyy has attended the G7 summits in person in both 2023 (Hiroshima) and 2024 (Apulia) since the full-scale invasion began, establishing a clear precedent. The G7 is arguably the most critical diplomatic forum for Ukraine to secure the military, economic, and political support necessary for its survival. As confirmed by the provided article, the invitation from host nation Canada has been extended. Therefore, both the motivation and the opportunity to attend are extremely high, making attendance the status quo expectation. The primary risk preventing attendance is the unpredictable nature of the ongoing war. A severe military crisis could make it politically or strategically untenable for him to leave the country. A specific, high-level security threat could also force a change of plans. However, given the short timeframe until the summit this month, the window for such a disruptive event to occur is limited. My forecast is not higher than 90% to account for these significant, albeit lower probability, war-related risks. It is not lower because the diplomatic necessity of his attendance is paramount, and precedents show that solutions are typically found to manage security and travel logistics. I would lower my forecast on credible reports of a major new Russian offensive or specific security threats. I would raise it if his travel to Canada was confirmed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Volodymyr Zelenskyy attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCalgary Herald: [Prime Minister Carney invites Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to G7 summit in Kananaskis](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/pm-mark-carney-invites-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-g7-summit-kananaskis)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
