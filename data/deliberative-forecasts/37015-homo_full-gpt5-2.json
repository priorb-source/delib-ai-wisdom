    "review": "Both forecasters’ arguments closely match mine: tight timeline, party-process barriers (missed Apr 15 PPP primary registration; leadership resistance), legal/eligibility pressure (May 4 resignation), negative polling/public sentiment, and lack of campaign infrastructure all point to No by default. Their tail-risk case—an elite-driven emergency draft—is the same pathway I considered. They didn’t add hard new facts, but I found their emphasis on procedural flexibility under pressure and concrete movement signals (rule-bending, key endorsements, resignation scheduling) useful as monitoring indicators. I also agree with their downside signals (PPP consolidating around another nominee; explicit denial from Han; election authorities reinforcing constraints).",
    "rationale": "Baseline remains No: announcing would likely necessitate an immediate resignation from the acting presidency under hostile optics, with weak polling and no visible campaign ramp. The party’s stated process and deadlines increase the friction, and norms cut against a caretaker entering. The only viable Yes path is a rapid, elite-coordinated draft with explicit rule-bending and cover from top PPP figures—none of which is visible yet. One nuance that keeps the probability from being very low is that the resolution is about announcing (not formal registration), which is a slightly lower bar if a last-minute pivot occurs before May 4. Given the alignment across analyses and no new positive signals, I make a small calibration toward the group center rather than a substantive update.",
