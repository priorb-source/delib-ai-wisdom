    "review": "Forecaster 3 adds a compelling point I underweighted: with ~20 days to go, a landmark joint session would likely be teased or appear on a public agenda given security/logistics. That lowers the conditional probability of a shared stage. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on YC’s unique leverage, the inaugural-event incentives, and Altman’s olive branch are valid reasons to keep the probability non-zero, but 25% seems high without any reciprocation from Musk or concrete signals from YC. I also agree with both that Musk’s unpredictability and the active litigation are significant headwinds. Net, I find Forecaster 3’s caution more persuasive at this stage.",
    "rationale": "I’m revising down my conditional assumptions. Updated decomposition: P(Altman in person) ~95%; P(Musk in person) ~60–65%; conditional on both attending, P(shared stage) ~10–15% absent any agenda teaser and given security/logistics plus ongoing litigation. That yields roughly 6–9%. I round up slightly to reflect YC’s incentive to create a moment and the small chance of a late surprise, but the lack of promotion this close to the event, Musk’s non-reciprocation, and brand-risk considerations make a joint stage unlikely. I will move up if YC publishes/teases a joint session or Musk publicly signals openness; I will move down if an agenda posts with separate slots, hostilities escalate, or either goes virtual/cancels.",
