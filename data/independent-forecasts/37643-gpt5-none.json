    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the item remains anything other than “complete” on the tracker",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No new law is enacted and no definitive policy action occurs that the tracker maintainers deem to have actually terminated PSLF, so the status stays at “in progress” (or similar) by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A law repealing/terminating PSLF is passed and signed before July 1, 2025, or the Department of Education definitively shutters PSLF in a way the tracker deems a completed termination and updates the spreadsheet to “complete.”",
    "rationale": "- Short timeline: Only ~7 weeks remain. Major statutory program terminations almost always require legislation and take longer than this.  \n- Legal constraints: PSLF is established in statute (HEA). Termination would typically need Congress. An administrative attempt to effectively end PSLF would face immediate litigation, making a clean, uncontested “termination” (and a confident “complete” marking) by July 1 unlikely.  \n- Base rates/status quo: The tracker currently shows “in progress.” Most items like this remain unchanged over short windows absent clear legislative action.  \n- Political/process realities: Even under favorable political alignment, moving a repeal through both chambers and to signature by July 1 is uncommon. If government is divided, the probability is near-zero.  \n- Tracker behavior: Community trackers tend to require concrete, verifiable implementation to mark “complete,” not merely proposals or intent.  \nWhy not higher: The combination of statutory change likely needed, litigation risk for any regulatory attempt, and the compressed calendar make completion by July 1 very unlikely.  \nWhy not lower (not zero): A small chance exists that Congress fast-tracks a repeal (e.g., as part of a must-pass or expedited package) or the tracker interprets decisive administrative action as sufficient for “complete.”  \nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting of imminent passage of a bill terminating PSLF; confirmation the tracker will mark “complete” upon administrative announcement rather than full implementation; evidence of the tracker rapidly marking similar items “complete” based on partial actions.  \nWhat would move me down: Signals of legislative gridlock, statements from DoE/White House ruling out changes before summer, or tracker guidance requiring full statutory repeal and implementation before marking “complete.”  \nResearch assistant: No additional info provided; forecast therefore leans on institutional/legal constraints and base rates.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
