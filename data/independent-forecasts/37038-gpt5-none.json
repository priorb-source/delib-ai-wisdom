    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the HTS continues to show Israel (IL) preferential rates, typically Free, under the US‑Israel FTA, not a uniform 17%.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Nothing material changes: the US‑Israel FTA remains in effect, and the HTS shows IL rates as Free or product‑specific rates that are not 17%. Even if trade tensions rise or targeted measures occur (e.g., AD/CVD on specific products), the HTS does not display a blanket 17% IL rate.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The US formally amends the HTS before June 1, 2025 to set Israel’s special rate (IL) to 17% (even if listed as suspended). This would likely follow a Presidential Proclamation or legislation suspending FTA preferences and explicitly inserting a 17% IL rate into the HTS, rather than defaulting to existing Column 1 rates.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and inertia: The US‑Israel FTA has been in place since 1985 and yields IL rates of duty that are typically Free. Changing the HTS to show a uniform 17% rate for Israel would be a sharp departure from long‑standing practice and would require clear legal action and a formal HTS amendment posted by the USITC.\n- Process considerations: Even in cases where the US has withdrawn preferences (e.g., Russia/Belarus NTR removal), the HTS generally defaults to existing statutory columns (e.g., Column 2) rather than imposing a single bespoke ad valorem rate across all subheadings. A uniform “17% for IL” would be unusual; the more standard path would be to remove Israel’s special rates and revert product-by-product to Column 1 (or another statutory column). Average Column 1 rates are far below 17% overall (though some categories are higher), making an exact “17% for Israel” listing unlikely.\n- Timing: With roughly five weeks until June 1, there’s limited time for drafting, announcing, and publishing an HTS supplement that inserts a 17% IL rate. Major policy shifts of this nature would almost certainly be signaled via USTR/White House announcements and Federal Register notices well in advance.\n- The ToI article indicates concern about potential tariffs, but there is no corroborating evidence (and my research assistant found no additional information) that a 17% Israel-specific HTS rate is planned. Moreover, the resolution note that “suspended will not affect resolution” slightly raises tail risk (because a listed but suspended 17% would still count), but there would still need to be a formal HTS change by that date.\n- Why not higher: Without concrete signals (legislation, a Presidential Proclamation, or a USITC docket indicating an IL=17% insertion), the probability of a bespoke 17% IL line appearing by June 1 is low.\n- Why not lower: Geopolitical uncertainty and recent scrutiny of Israel policies introduce a nonzero tail risk of trade preference adjustments. The resolution language allows a suspended listing to count, marginally increasing the chance that an entry could appear even if not yet in force.\n- What would move me up: (1) A credible USTR/White House announcement or Federal Register notice proposing to suspend or alter Israel’s FTA benefits with an explicit 17% IL rate; (2) USITC posting a forthcoming HTS supplement showing an IL rate of 17%; (3) Congressional movement on a bill prescribing a 17% tariff rate for Israel and an imminent effective date.\n- What would move me down: (1) Official statements ruling out tariff changes on Israeli goods; (2) Publication of the next HTS supplement before June 1 with no relevant changes; (3) Indications that any contemplated changes would default to Column 1/2 rates rather than an explicit 17% IL rate.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information available; nothing to counter the status quo assessment.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Israel as 17% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of Israel: [Israeli exports to US will take annual $2.3B hit under tariffs, industrial org warns](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-exports-to-us-will-take-2-3-billion-hit-under-tariffs-industrialist-org-warns/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 17% for Israel at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=israel) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
