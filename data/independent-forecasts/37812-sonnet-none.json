    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on Lebanon's ongoing challenges, the status quo likely has Beirut serving between 40-55 direct flight destinations, with the exact number uncertain but probably near the threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Regional tensions continue or escalate, economic pressures persist, and airlines maintain reduced route networks to Beirut. The airport serves 51 or fewer direct destinations, consistent with reduced connectivity due to security concerns and low tourism demand.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Summer 2025 sees some normalization with airlines maintaining or slightly expanding their Middle Eastern and European connections. Baseline connectivity stays robust enough that Beirut maintains 52+ direct destinations through diaspora travel, essential business routes, and regional connections despite broader challenges.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires estimating Beirut's current flight connectivity without direct data. Lebanon faces significant headwinds: economic crisis, Israeli-Hezbollah tensions, and struggling tourism (per the provided articles). However, several factors suggest connectivity may remain relatively resilient: (1) Beirut is Lebanon's only major international airport and serves vital diaspora connections; (2) Summer schedules are typically more robust than winter; (3) Flight schedules 41 days out are largely already set, meaning dramatic changes are unlikely; (4) Some baseline Middle Eastern and European routes typically persist even during crises. The specific threshold of 51 destinations appears deliberately challenging - neither clearly above nor below what a struggling regional capital might maintain. Major regional capitals typically serve 30-80+ destinations depending on circumstances. Given Lebanon's multi-year crisis, I estimate current connectivity is likely in the 40-55 range. The question asks for GREATER than 51 (52+), making this a close call. My forecast is not higher because: clear evidence of declining tourism, security concerns limiting operations, and economic pressures on airlines. It's not lower because: some baseline connectivity typically persists, summer schedules favor more routes, and short timeframe limits downside scenarios. I would update higher with data showing current destinations at 50+ or airline announcements of new routes; lower with data showing only 30-40 current destinations or further conflict escalation.",
