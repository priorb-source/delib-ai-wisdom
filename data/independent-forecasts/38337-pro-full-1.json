  "information": "According to the U.S. Department of Labor, initial jobless claims for the week ending May 31, 2025, rose by 8,000 to 247,000, the highest level in eight months. The figure for the prior week was revised to 239,000. The four-week moving average increased to 235,000, the highest since November 2021. For the week ending May 24, the number of continuing claims was 1.904 million, a slight decrease of 3,000 from the previous week.\n\nBroader labor market indicators suggest a softening trend. A report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed that U.S.-based employers announced 93,816 job cuts in May, which is 47% higher than in May 2024. Separately, the ADP employment report revealed that only 37,000 jobs were created in the private sector in May, the lowest figure in a year. Both the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report and an Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey pointed to weakening conditions, with widespread comments about economic uncertainty delaying new hiring.\n\nThe recent rise in jobless claims was not uniform across the country. The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending May 31 were in Michigan, Nebraska, California, Florida, and Virginia. The largest decreases were reported in Massachusetts, Illinois, Texas, Washington, and New York. Several major corporations have announced layoffs in 2025, including Procter & Gamble, Microsoft, Citigroup, Walmart, Meta, and Disney.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3 weeks. The data for the week ending June 21, 2025, is scheduled to be released on June 26, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The most recent data for the week ending May 31, 2025, showed 247,000 claims, and the four-week moving average is 235,000. Both are comfortably above the 220,000 threshold, and the recent trend is upward.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recent spike in claims proves to be a temporary anomaly caused by a few specific large layoffs that have now washed through the system. The next two weekly reports show a sharp reversal, bringing the number back below 220,000 as other sectors of the economy remain resilient.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current upward trend continues or stabilizes at this higher level. The softening labor market conditions indicated by the ADP report, job cut announcements, and Federal Reserve surveys persist, leading to continued elevated layoffs that keep the initial claims number above the 220,000 mark for the week in question.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the recent trend and level of initial jobless claims. The latest report for the week ending May 31, 2025, showed claims at 247,000, the highest in eight months and significantly above the 220,000 threshold. The four-week moving average has also risen to 235,000, suggesting this is not a one-off event but a sustained shift. This status quo is the single most important factor in my forecast.\n\nThis trend is supported by broader macroeconomic data indicating a cooling labor market. Reports from Challenger, Gray & Christmas show a 47% year-over-year increase in announced job cuts for May, and the ADP employment report showed a significant slowdown in private sector job creation. Furthermore, surveys like the Fed's Beige Book and ISM point to widespread economic uncertainty causing delays in hiring. The announced layoffs from several major corporations in 2025 are likely still being processed, providing a steady stream of new claims.\n\nMy probability is not higher because weekly jobless claims data is inherently volatile and prone to revisions. A single week can see a sharp drop due to seasonal factors or a temporary lull in layoff processing, making a sub-220,000 reading possible, though unlikely. \n\nMy probability is not lower because the confluence of evidence points strongly towards a softening labor market. The primary data (weekly claims) and the secondary, corroborating data (job cut announcements, hiring surveys) are all aligned. For the number to drop below 220,000 would require a sharp reversal of the current, well-supported trend in just two weeks.\n\nI would increase my probability if the upcoming claims data for the weeks of June 7 and June 14 remain at or above 240,000. I would decrease my probability if those reports show a significant and sustained drop back towards the 220,000-225,000 range.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
