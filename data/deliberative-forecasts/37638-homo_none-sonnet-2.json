    "review": "All three forecasters converge on similar reasoning: the extremely compressed 6-7 week timeframe until July 1, combined with the Texas Legislature's biennial session likely ending in late May/early June, creates a dominant constraint. Forecaster 2's explicit breakdown of the multi-step legislative process (committee approval, passage through both chambers, reconciliation, gubernatorial signature) is particularly compelling - these steps typically require months, not weeks. Forecaster 3 raises a valid point about Texas's conservative drug policy history, but this may be offset by hemp industry lobbying and libertarian elements in Texas politics. The convergence of forecasts (8%, 12%, 18%) suggests we're capturing the core dynamics correctly. The most telling factor is the complete absence of specific information about bill numbers, sponsors, committee progress, or vote schedules - if legislation were seriously advancing in the final weeks of session, we would expect concrete details. The Beaumont Enterprise article's questioning tone ('Will THC see its final death blow?') rather than declarative reporting further suggests significant uncertainty about passage even at the time of writing.",
    "rationale": "Upon deliberation, I find Forecaster 2's emphasis on the complexity of the legislative process particularly persuasive. We're approximately 19 days from the typical end of the Texas legislative session (early June), and for a comprehensive THC ban to pass, it would need to already be well-advanced through committees and scheduled for floor votes. The multi-chamber passage, reconciliation process, and gubernatorial signature realistically require more time than remains. The base rate for controversial legislation passing in the final weeks of session without documented momentum is quite low. While I cannot assign near-zero probability due to theoretical fast-track procedures and the documented legislative interest, the combination of tight timeline, lack of specific progress indicators, and typical legislative friction argues for a probability closer to the lower end of our range. I'm updating my forecast downward from 12% to 10%, aligning more closely with Forecaster 2's analysis while maintaining a small buffer for uncertainty about current bill status and the possibility of expedited procedures.",
