    "review": "The other forecasters raise important reinforcing points that strengthen my original analysis. Forecaster 2's emphasis on institutional inertia and the requirement for 'extreme circumstances' (state collapse, active warfare, ordered departures) for Level 4 is particularly salient. The fact that only 21 countries globally have Level 4 status, as Forecaster 3 notes, underscores how high the bar truly is. All three analyses converge on 18-20%, which suggests we're identifying similar patterns. However, I want to examine one crucial detail more carefully: the advisory being 2+ years old despite 6-month review requirements. This could indicate either (a) internal reviews confirmed Level 3 without public updates, suggesting stability, or (b) a formal update is genuinely overdue. The South Sudan precedent from March 2025 shows upgrades do happen, but they're triggered by specific acute events like personnel evacuations. The July 2023 coup test is critical evidence - if a military coup didn't trigger escalation to Level 4, the threshold appears very high indeed. The regional Level 4 designations for specific Niger areas demonstrate the State Department's ability to calibrate risk geographically, reducing pressure for a nationwide upgrade.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, my core reasoning remains sound but is strengthened by additional evidence. The convergence at 18-20% reflects strong agreement on key factors: (1) Institutional inertia is powerful - Niger survived a coup without escalation, (2) Level 4 is exceptionally rare (21 countries) and requires extreme circumstances typically involving personnel evacuations, (3) The 60-day timeframe makes policy changes less likely absent acute triggers, (4) The regional Level 4 approach already addresses highest-risk areas. The main uncertainty remains whether the 2+ year old advisory indicates pending review or confirmed stability. However, the absence of reported trigger events (personnel threats, major incidents, evacuation signals) in recent months strongly favors status quo. The South Sudan upgrade in March 2025 occurred with a clear trigger (ordered departure). No such signals exist for Niger currently. While regional instability and the outdated advisory prevent going lower than 15%, the overwhelming evidence points toward continuity. I'm maintaining 18% as it appropriately weights the dominant status quo bias against the non-trivial but limited risk of escalation in a volatile region over a short timeframe.",
