  "information": "The broader US stock market is experiencing significant volatility driven by corporate earnings, trade policy uncertainty, and economic indicators. President Trump's tariffs sparked a 2,200-point drop in the DJIA on April 4, 2025. In response to the impact of tariffs, Deutsche Bank strategists cut their year-end S&P 500 target by 12%. The Federal Reserve is described as cautious due to persistent inflation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 67 days (from April 25, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - none of the 30 current DJIA components get removed from the index",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The S&P Dow Jones Indices committee determines that no changes to the DJIA composition are warranted during this period. All 30 listed companies maintain their financial stability and market positions, and the committee sees no need for rebalancing following the recent Intel/Nvidia swap.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One or more companies face significant challenges (financial distress, acquisition announcement, or strategic committee decision) prompting the DJIA committee to announce a removal. Boeing, given its ongoing operational challenges, could be particularly vulnerable, or the committee could decide another rebalancing is needed to better reflect the economy.",
    "rationale": "Historical base rate analysis suggests DJIA changes occur roughly 1-2 times per year on average, though frequency varies. The recent Intel removal (replaced by Nvidia) mentioned in the background indicates the committee recently acted to modernize the index, which typically reduces the likelihood of another near-term change. The 67-day window is relatively short for such decisions. However, several factors warrant a non-trivial probability: (1) Market volatility with the 2,200-point drop in April 2025 and trade policy uncertainty could stress weaker constituents; (2) With 30 companies in scope, the aggregate risk is meaningful; (3) Boeing has faced ongoing challenges and represents the most vulnerable candidate; (4) Economic stress from tariffs and Fed caution could accelerate committee action. Most listed companies (Apple, Microsoft, JPMorgan, etc.) are extremely stable blue chips unlikely to face removal absent extraordinary circumstances. Acquisitions are improbable given the size of these firms. The forecast balances the status quo bias (no changes most likely in a 2-month window after a recent swap) against the non-zero historical frequency of changes and current market stress. The probability is not higher because: recent changes reduce near-term likelihood, the time window is short, and these are all established companies. It's not lower because: changes do occur as evidenced by Intel's removal, 30 companies provide multiple risk points, and economic stress could accelerate decisions. I would revise upward if specific reports emerge about any company facing acute problems or committee discussions. I would revise downward if the market stabilizes significantly or the committee publicly signals satisfaction with current composition.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe broader US stock market is experiencing significant volatility driven by corporate earnings, trade policy uncertainty, and economic indicators. President Trump's tariffs sparked a 2,200-point drop in the DJIA on April 4, 2025. In response to the impact of tariffs, Deutsche Bank strategists cut their year-end S&P 500 target by 12%. The Federal Reserve is described as cautious due to persistent inflation.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
