    "review": "Both forecasters appropriately weight the extremely low March print and the inertia of unemployment, and Forecaster 3 usefully notes that by Apr 29 the underlying April outcome is essentially already determined, barring reporting/measurement surprises. I agree that tariff impacts are more likely to phase in over months via hours cuts and informality before visible unemployment spikes. Neither forecaster addresses a key resolution risk: which series Trading Economics will display (seasonally adjusted vs. not) and rounding effects at the 3.0% threshold. That is the main tail risk I see, along with potential data revisions.",
    "rationale": "Baseline conditions (Mar ~2.2-2.3%, Feb 2.5%) imply a ≥0.7–0.8 pp one‑month jump is needed to breach 3.0%, which is rare absent acute shocks. The tariff shock is meaningful but likely diffuses over time; Mexico’s large informal sector and firms’ preference to adjust hours first buffer the headline rate. The rise in underemployment signals some softening but doesn’t imply an immediate jump above 3% in April. With April essentially complete, real‑economy risk is lower than earlier in the month. My main residual concern remains the resolution source: Trading Economics’ choice of series and rounding at exactly 3.0%. Balancing the added confidence from timing (Forecaster 3’s point) against TE-series/rounding risk (noted in my prior analysis), I nudge my probability up slightly.",
