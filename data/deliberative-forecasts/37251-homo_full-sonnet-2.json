    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that have caused me to reconsider my initial assessment. They both emphasize two critical points I underweighted: (1) the status quo principle - the current state is 'no announcement' and changing that requires active decisions with limited time, and (2) the significance of the missed Q1 2025 timeline. If negotiations were truly in 'final stages' in January with Q1 expectations, being 2+ months past that deadline without announcement is a stronger negative signal than I initially credited. Forecaster 2 also raises a factor I hadn't explicitly considered: potential Chinese diplomatic pressure on Vietnam, which could explain delays given the sensitive geopolitical dynamics. Their convergence on 48% from independent analysis suggests there's signal in that number. However, I'm not fully convinced they've properly weighted the strength of the underlying deal fundamentals - the extensive preparation (training programs, ministerial visits, strategic partnership elevation) suggests this is more than aspirational talk. The strategic imperative for Vietnam to diversify from Russian suppliers amid South China Sea tensions remains pressing and urgent. While 2 months is tight, it's sufficient time for an announcement if the deal substance is ready.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should update downward but not all the way to 48%. The missed Q1 timeline is indeed more significant than I initially assessed - it's been 4+ months since reports of 'final stages' negotiations. This suggests either the reports overstated proximity to completion, unexpected complications arose, or political factors (possibly Chinese pressure) created delays. The status quo principle is valid: with only 2 months remaining and the current state being 'no announcement,' the burden of proof favors No. However, I maintain that 48% underweights the substantial groundwork already completed and the urgent strategic drivers. Vietnamese troops already trained on the system, the Defense Minister personally inspected it, and the comprehensive strategic partnership provides political framework. The deal's strategic logic hasn't diminished. My updated view is that the missed timeline warrants meaningful downward revision from my 62%, but the strong fundamentals prevent me from going below 50%. A coin flip slightly favoring Yes (rather than slightly favoring No) better reflects the tension between delayed timelines and solid deal fundamentals.",
