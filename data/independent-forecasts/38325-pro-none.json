    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately three weeks. The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is scheduled to release the third estimate for Q1 2025 GDP at the end of June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recent official data, the advance estimate, reported annualized real GDP growth at -0.3%. As this is not greater than 0.0%, the current data points to a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The second estimate (released in late May) and subsequent incoming data for the third estimate confirm the initial weakness. Final data on business inventories, net exports, or consumer spending come in at or below initial estimates, resulting in a final growth figure that remains negative or is revised to exactly 0.0%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "More complete source data leads to upward revisions that are sufficient to push the growth rate into positive territory. For example, stronger-than-anticipated business investment, a smaller trade deficit, or higher state and local government spending could be revised up, lifting the final calculation by the necessary 0.4 percentage points or more.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the single data point provided—the advance estimate of -0.3%—and the historical behavior of BEA revisions. The status quo is a 'No' outcome, as we are starting from a negative growth figure. However, GDP estimates are frequently revised as more comprehensive data becomes available. The revision required to move from -0.3% to positive territory (e.g., +0.1%) is 0.4 percentage points. Historically, the average absolute revision between the advance and third estimates is approximately 0.5 to 0.6 percentage points, meaning a revision of this magnitude is common and well within the typical range. The initial estimate is very close to the zero threshold, making a change in sign plausible. My probability is not higher than 55% because the initial estimate is still the best single predictor, and it points to a contraction. To be more confident in a 'Yes' outcome, I would need to see evidence from the second estimate (released in late May) or other high-frequency economic data suggesting underlying strength that was missed in the initial report. My probability is not lower because a -0.3% reading is statistically very close to zero, and the potential for revisions to flip the sign is substantial. A forecast below 50% would underweight the known volatility and revision patterns of initial GDP estimates. I would become more confident in 'No' if the second estimate showed a further downward revision, and more confident in 'Yes' if it had already revised the figure into positive territory.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the third estimate of Q1 2025 annualized real GDP growth show an increase?\n\nQuestion background:\nAdvisor Perspectives: [Q1 GDP Advance Estimate: Real GDP at -0.3%, Lower Than Expected](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/2025/04/30/gdp-gross-domestic-product-q1-2025-advance-estimate)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Bureau of Economic Analysis' Gross Domestic Product, 1st Quarter 2025 (Third Estimate) release shows that real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate greater than 0.0%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
