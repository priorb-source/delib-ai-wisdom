  "information": "For the fourth quarter of 2024, Chegg reported a 24% year-over-year decrease in revenue and a 23% drop in subscription sales. This marked the ninth consecutive quarter of revenue decline for the company. Chegg's financial metrics include a negative Altman Z-score of -3.31, an indicator of potential financial distress. Conversely, its Piotroski F-Score is 7, suggesting some aspects of its financial health remain robust. As of its last report, the company maintained a net-cash position of several hundred million dollars, reported positive free cash flow, and had no large debt maturities due before 2026.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 weeks (≈57 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Chegg does not file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Chegg continues operating with positive free cash flow and a net-cash position, manages costs as revenues decline, and faces no imminent maturities or covenant triggers; thus, no need to file before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden liquidity shock forces an urgent filing: e.g., a major legal or regulatory hit, cyber incident, revenue collapse causing rapid cash burn, a covenant breach/acceleration on debt, or failed access to working-capital financing leading management to pursue a prepackaged Chapter 11 in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "Timeframe matters. There are roughly 57 days left. In such a short window, bankruptcies typically arise from an acute liquidity crisis, a near-term maturity wall, or a triggered default. The research assistant notes Chegg has several hundred million dollars of net cash, positive free cash flow, and no large debt maturities before 2026. That makes an urgent Chapter 11 filing by July 1, 2025 unlikely absent a shock. While fundamentals are deteriorating (Q4 2024 revenue down 24% YoY, ninth straight quarterly decline) and the Altman Z-score is deeply negative (-3.31, signaling elevated distress risk on a multi-quarter horizon), the Piotroski F-score of 7 and net-cash/positive FCF profile suggest near-term solvency is not in question. Altman Z can overstate near-term bankruptcy risk for asset-light, tech-enabled firms with volatile market caps. Status quo outcomes deserve extra weight: companies rarely transition from cash-positive with no imminent maturities to a bankruptcy filing within two months unless a discrete adverse event occurs. Why not higher? No large maturities until 2026, positive FCF, and net cash imply runway. No public signals (per the provided brief) of going-concern warnings, covenant stress, or missed payments. Why not lower? The magnitude and persistence of revenue declines, the negative Altman Z, and business-model disruption from AI introduce tail risk that a sudden shock (legal, operational, cyber, or market) could force a rapid filing. What would move me up: an 8-K indicating liquidity strain or going-concern language, a missed/withheld interest payment, covenant breach or acceleration, auditor resignation or financial restatement, withdrawal of guidance with liquidity warnings, a major adverse legal or regulatory event, or reports of exploring in-court restructuring. What would move me down: reiterated guidance with explicit liquidity runway through 2026, continued positive FCF in Q1/Q2 2025, new financing or extended maturities, or asset sales that bolster cash.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chegg file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWall Street Journal: [How ChatGPT Brought Down an Online Education Giant](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-chatgpt-brought-down-an-online-education-giant-200b4ff2)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Chegg, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, Chegg reported a 24% year-over-year decrease in revenue and a 23% drop in subscription sales.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
