  "information": "The University of Michigan's final Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) for May 2025 was 52.2, the same as the final reading for April. This followed a decline from 64.7 in February and 57.0 in March, marking a nearly 30% drop since January. The index's components also declined in April, with the Current Economic Conditions Index falling to 59.8 and the Economic Expectations Index dropping to 47.3. Consumers' short-term (one-year) inflation expectations reported in the survey rose to 6.5% in April, the highest since November 1981, while long-term inflation expectations increased to 4.4%. Historically, from 2010 to 2019, index increases of 8 points or more in a single month occurred less than 3% of the time.\n\nAccording to ADP data, U.S. private-sector hiring slowed significantly in May 2025, with only 37,000 jobs added, the slowest pace in over two years. Job losses were noted in business services, manufacturing, and education. A separate University of Michigan survey shows consumers expect unemployment to climb. Data on consumer behavior shows personal spending rose by 0.2% last month, while the savings rate increased to 4.9% in March, the highest level in nearly a year. Following the end of the pandemic-era payment pause on student loans, delinquencies jumped from 1% to 7.74%. In contrast to the University of Michigan's findings, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 98 in May from 85.7 in the prior month.\n\nThe ongoing trade war with China is a frequently cited source of uncertainty for American consumers, with the U.S. having doubled steel tariffs. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller has outlined a potential path to interest rate cuts later in the year, but noted that considerable uncertainty remains around the level of tariffs. Waller also largely dismissed the high inflation expectations recorded in the University of Michigan survey, stating a preference for market-based measures and professional forecasts.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The report is expected on June 27, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The index has been flat at a low 52.2 for the past two months. Maintaining this trend would mean the June number remains far below the 60.0 threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The official May employment report confirms the weak ADP hiring data, inflation expectations remain elevated, and uncertainty around trade policy persists. Consumers remain cautious, keeping spending low and their sentiment pessimistic. The index registers a third consecutive month in the low 50s, resolving the question as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A combination of strong positive economic shocks occurs in June. This includes a surprisingly robust official jobs report, a notable and sustained fall in gasoline prices, and concrete progress in trade negotiations with China. This cascade of good news reverses the recent negative trend and causes an atypically large surge in sentiment, pushing the index above 60.0.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant headwinds facing consumer sentiment. The status quo outcome is No, as the index would need to jump by more than 7.8 points from its May level of 52.2, an historically rare event occurring less than 3% of the time in a single month between 2010-2019. The recent trend is negative, with the index falling from 64.7 in February. The underlying data supports continued weakness: private-sector hiring has slowed dramatically according to ADP, consumers' own inflation expectations are at multi-decade highs, personal spending is sluggish, and financial stress is evident in rising student loan delinquencies. While the Conference Board's confidence index recently rose, that metric often diverges from the University of Michigan survey, which is more sensitive to personal finances and inflation—the very factors showing weakness right now. My probability is not lower than 15% to account for the inherent volatility of sentiment data and the small possibility of a significant positive shock, such as a major de-escalation in the trade war or a surprisingly strong jobs report that could reverse the current pessimism. My probability is not higher because the weight of the current data, from labor market weakness to high inflation expectations, points strongly towards sentiment remaining depressed. I would raise my forecast with a combination of a strong official jobs report and a significant drop in energy prices. I would lower it if inflation data for May comes in higher than expected.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
