  "information": "According to the US Census Bureau, U.S. imports reached a record high of $342.7 billion in March 2025, a 5% increase from February. This surge was attributed to businesses front-running impending tariffs. The import of consumer goods rose 55.5% year-over-year to $102.8 billion, and automotive vehicle imports also jumped. This activity led to the U.S. trade deficit for goods increasing by 9.6% to a record $162 billion in March. A similar, though smaller, surge was observed in January 2025, when imports reached $320 billion, with notable increases in shipments from China, Canada, and Mexico.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services report for April 2025 is typically released in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The significant front-running of imports in March to pre-empt new tariffs created an artificial peak. The status quo is for this peak to be followed by a sharp drop in April imports as businesses draw down their now-high inventories, causing the total value to fall below the $338.5 billion threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Businesses, having stockpiled goods by pulling forward orders into March, drastically cut new import orders for April. The implementation or continued threat of new tariffs further suppresses demand. This combined effect results in a sharp month-over-month decline, with the total value of April imports falling well below the $338.5 billion threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the March surge, underlying U.S. economic demand is exceptionally robust, and the front-running of orders was less extensive than believed. Alternatively, a delay in tariff implementation could cause a second wave of urgent orders in April. A sharp rise in the price of key commodities like oil during April could also inflate the total value of imports, pushing the figure over the threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the reported record-high imports in March 2025, which were explicitly attributed to businesses front-running impending tariffs. The reported surge to $342.7 billion, with consumer goods imports up 55.5% year-over-year, indicates a significant pull-forward of demand from future months, including April. This economic behavior almost invariably creates a subsequent 'hangover' period where import volumes fall sharply as companies have already built up their inventories. The threshold of $338.5 billion is only slightly below the March peak, but a correction back towards the January level of $320 billion or lower seems much more probable after such a distortion.\n\nMy probability is not lower (closer to 0%) because U.S. economic fundamentals might be stronger than anticipated, creating sustained high demand that could partially offset the drop. Furthermore, a significant, unexpected spike in commodity prices (e.g., oil) during April could inflate the total import value, even if volumes decrease. \n\nMy probability is not higher (closer to 50%) because the evidence for front-running is strong and such a large, artificial surge is rarely sustained. The economic incentive for companies is to now pause and absorb their existing inventory rather than continue importing at a record pace, especially with the prospect of higher tariff-related costs.\n\nI would increase my forecast probability towards 'Yes' if there were official news that all proposed tariffs were permanently canceled and high-frequency data (e.g., port traffic) showed continued high activity through April. Conversely, I would decrease it if industry reports in early May confirm large inventory overhangs and a collapse in new orders.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US imports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of imports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 338,483 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, U.S. imports reached a record high of $342.7 billion in March 2025, a 5% increase from February. This surge was attributed to businesses front-running impending tariffs. The import of consumer goods rose 55.5% year-over-year to $102.8 billion, and automotive vehicle imports also jumped.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
