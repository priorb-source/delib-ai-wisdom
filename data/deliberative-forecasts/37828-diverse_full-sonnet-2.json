    "review": "All three forecasters demonstrate strong agreement on the fundamental analysis, with forecasts clustering tightly in the 2-5% range. This convergence is reassuring and suggests we've identified the key evidence correctly. Forecaster 2 makes an excellent point about credibility damage - a CEO reversal within 5 weeks of explicit public statements would seriously harm management credibility with investors and employees, creating strong disincentive against such a move. Forecaster 3 raises an important constraint I hadn't fully weighted: the resolution criteria are quite strict, requiring either an S-1 filing or announcement on Rippling's own blog. Third-party reports, leaks, or confidential submission rumors wouldn't count. This narrows the resolution paths and meaningfully reduces probability. The Deel legal distraction point adds another layer of operational complexity that makes an IPO announcement even less likely in this compressed timeframe. All forecasters correctly emphasize the timing of Conrad's statements - made in May 2025, essentially concurrent with our forecast period - which makes them particularly credible and hard to dismiss. The agreement on core evidence (recent funding, tender offer, profitability precondition, short timeframe) across all three analyses validates these as the critical factors.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my original 4% was slightly too high given the strict resolution criteria emphasized by Forecaster 3. The requirement that resolution occur only via S-1 filing or Rippling's own blog announcement (not third-party reports) meaningfully constrains the paths to a Yes outcome. Combined with Forecaster 2's credibility damage argument and the extremely recent timing of Conrad's statements (literally weeks ago), the evidence points even more strongly toward No. However, I don't think 2% is appropriate either - that level of confidence seems excessive given inherent unpredictability in corporate decisions and the possibility of rapid market shifts or strategic pivots. While unlikely, scenarios exist where profitability is achieved faster than expected, market windows open suddenly, or strategic considerations change. The ~40-day timeframe is very short but not impossible for an announcement. I'm updating to 3% to incorporate the resolution criteria strictness while maintaining appropriate uncertainty about tail risk scenarios.",
