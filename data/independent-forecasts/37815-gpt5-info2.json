  "information": "The U.S. government's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officially document and investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). In 2020, the Department of Defense established a UAP Task Force to track and analyze sightings. According to official data, 757 UAP reports were documented between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. As of the latest report, only 49 of these cases have been officially closed. A report submitted to the U.S. Congress stated that of the 757 observations, no evidence suggested extraterrestrial origin; analysis indicated approximately 70% of the objects were balloons and 16% were drones.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (until Metaculus checks on/after July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "NUFORC receives no June 2025 submissions from pilots for South American locations, or any June 2025 South American sightings posted are from non-pilots, or the location/date doesn’t match the criteria.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one airline or private pilot reports a June 2025 sighting occurring in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, etc., to NUFORC, and NUFORC posts it with a pilot designation that appears under the June 2025 South America listings.",
    "rationale": "Baseline considerations: NUFORC is US-centric, and “pilot” is a relatively rare subset of all reports. International submissions—especially from South America, where language and awareness barriers exist—appear less frequent than US ones. A single-month window further reduces odds. However, the example of a Brazil pilot report in Dec 2024 shows such reports do occur, so the probability is not negligible. Pilots flying international routes (including US carriers into South America) provide a pathway for NUFORC submissions despite regional bias. Seasonal/operational factors in June (normal commercial traffic, frequent twilight satellite trains, rocket/Starlink visibility) could generate report-worthy stimuli, but whether a South America–located event gets reported by a pilot to NUFORC in that specific month remains uncertain.\n\nAssistant-received research influence: The AARO/FAA context shows a nontrivial volume of airborne UAP reporting overall and that most have mundane explanations. While this doesn’t directly predict NUFORC’s South America pilot posting, it supports that pilots do report UAP/UFO observations with some frequency, keeping the probability above very low levels.\n\nWhy not higher: (1) Pilot-tagged NUFORC reports are a small fraction of total; (2) NUFORC’s intake skews to the US; (3) One-month, region-specific window is narrow; (4) Language/awareness friction may suppress South American pilot submissions specifically to NUFORC.\n\nWhy not lower: (1) Documented precedent (e.g., Brazil Dec 2024) proves feasibility; (2) Many countries/air routes in scope—multiple chances in a month; (3) Continued high public/pilot attention to UAP and frequent sky phenomena (e.g., satellites, re-entries) that can trigger reports.\n\nWhat would raise my forecast: Evidence that NUFORC has posted multiple South American pilot reports in recent quarters; a widely visible South America–centric sky event in June (e.g., spectacular Starlink trains or a notable re-entry) that affects airline routes; NUFORC emphasizing/soliciting pilot reports internationally.\n\nWhat would lower my forecast: Confirmation that NUFORC has had zero South American pilot posts in the past 6–12 months aside from the Dec 2024 example; signs NUFORC is posting fewer international items or fewer pilot-tagged entries; signals that South American pilots predominantly use other reporting channels not mirrored by NUFORC.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in South America in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) a sighting in Brazil in December 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the South American continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. government's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officially document and investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
