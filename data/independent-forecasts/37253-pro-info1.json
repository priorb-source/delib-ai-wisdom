  "information": "North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, with the last one occurring in September 2017. The current gap of over seven and a half years is the longest interval between tests. According to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS), the tunnels at the Punggye-ri test site are maintained in an operational condition. The U.S. State Department also assesses that the site remains capable of supporting a seventh test. The IAEA has warned about an 'exponential' expansion of North Korea's nuclear program and ongoing plutonium production at the Yongbyon facility. However, analysis of satellite imagery by the think tank 38 North shows no new tunneling activity at Punggye-ri, and there are no public reports of specific preparations such as equipment movement or other logistical arrangements that would typically precede a test.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "North Korea maintains its current strategic posture, refraining from a nuclear test. This could be due to continued satisfaction with its existing deterrent, a desire to avoid further international condemnation and sanctions, or the absence of a compelling strategic or technical reason to conduct a test. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without a test occurring.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant geopolitical event, such as a dramatic escalation in tensions with the United States or South Korea, or a domestic political imperative, prompts Kim Jong Un to order a seventh nuclear test. The test would serve to demonstrate a new capability, such as a tactical or miniaturized warhead, and reassert North Korea's military strength.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo. North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test since September 2017, the longest hiatus in its history. Continuing this multi-year trend for another two months is the most probable outcome. The research indicating a lack of new tunneling activity or other specific logistical preparations at the Punggye-ri test site is a key piece of evidence supporting this. A nuclear test requires observable preparations, and their absence so close to the deadline significantly lowers the probability of an imminent test.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 10% because the technical capability for a test remains. Reports from the U.S. State Department and South Korea's NIS confirm the test site is maintained in a state of readiness, meaning the lead time for a test could be relatively short if a political decision is made. Furthermore, the IAEA's reports of an expanding nuclear program suggest ongoing development that could eventually require testing for validation. North Korea's strategic unpredictability and the volatile security situation on the Korean peninsula mean that a sudden decision to test cannot be ruled out.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 10% because the long pause in testing has created its own inertia, and breaking it would be a major strategic decision with significant diplomatic and economic consequences, potentially alienating even its partners like China and Russia. The lack of observable preparations is the most compelling short-term indicator that a test is not planned within this two-month window.\n\nI would increase my forecast if satellite imagery revealed new activity at the Punggye-ri site, such as equipment movement or preparations to seal a tunnel. I would decrease my forecast as the deadline approaches with no such signs or if there were a significant diplomatic de-escalation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill North Korea test a nuclear weapon before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and in 2017.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting such as the [International Monitoring System’s ](https://www.ctbto.org/our-work/detecting-nuclear-tests) and the sources cited at Wikipedia's [List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNorth Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, with the last one occurring in September 2017.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
