    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 months (election expected Oct 20, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Conservatives win the popular vote",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A late-campaign realignment on the center-left: Liberals recover sharply (especially in Ontario and urban/suburban ridings) as NDP voters strategically consolidate behind them, while Conservatives stumble on a major scandal or highly salient policy misstep that drives a 10–15 point swing against them nationally, allowing Liberals to edge the popular vote.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Current polling margins persist: Conservatives maintain a double‑digit national lead into election day, the center-left vote remains split between Liberals and NDP (plus Bloc strength in Quebec), and CPC wins the national popular vote by a comfortable margin.",
    "rationale": "Baseline/Status quo: Public polling and aggregators discussed in Politico’s Apr 14, 2025 piece indicate the Conservatives have held a large, sustained national popular‑vote lead (often low‑ to mid‑40s CPC vs mid‑20s Liberals, with NDP in the high‑teens). That pattern has been stable for months, driven by cost‑of‑living and housing salience and Liberal brand fatigue. With roughly six months to go, inertia favors the Conservatives maintaining the popular‑vote lead. Historical context: In both 2019 and 2021 the Conservatives won the popular vote even when they failed to win the most seats. That suggests they can over‑accumulate votes in strongholds, making it even harder for rivals to surpass them in the national vote without a large, broad‑based swing. For a No outcome, two things likely need to happen together: (1) a meaningful Conservative decline (material negative event, debate collapse, or issue re‑salience that uniquely harms them), and (2) consolidation of anti‑Conservative voters behind the Liberals, especially in Ontario and key metro areas. While possible, achieving a 10+ point national swing from today’s baseline is uncommon this late in the pre‑writ period. Why not higher: Canadian campaigns can still move opinion; polling error or turnout differentials could narrow the gap; a unifying Liberal message or an NDP‑to‑Liberal strategic shift could compress CPC’s lead more than expected. Why not lower: The lead has been wide, persistent, and cross‑pollster; the structural center‑left split (plus Bloc in Quebec) makes surpassing CPC in the popular vote particularly challenging; and as opposition, CPC is less exposed to governing shocks that typically erode incumbents. What would change my view upward: Continued double‑digit CPC leads through late summer; signs of limited NDP‑to‑Liberal consolidation; worsening Liberal negatives; or strong CPC performance in Ontario polling specifically. What would change my view downward: Multiple reputable polls narrowing the CPC lead to single digits for several consecutive weeks; evidence of strategic consolidation behind the Liberals; a major, sustained CPC scandal; or clear economic improvements credited to the government. Research assistant input: None provided beyond the prompt link; forecast relies on publicly discussed polling context (e.g., Politico article) and historical patterns.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
