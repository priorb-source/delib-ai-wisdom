    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling historical context I underweighted. The concrete seat results from 2019 and 2021 (32 vs 10 in both elections) represent a 3:1 ratio that's far more decisive than polling percentages alone suggest. Forecaster 3's seat projection models (19-25 for BQ vs 10-12 for CPC) are particularly valuable - even at the most Conservative-favorable end, the BQ still leads by 7+ seats. \n\nThe most important insight both raise is the Liberal surge dynamic: Mark Carney's rise hurts the Bloc but converts seats to Liberals, NOT Conservatives. Liberal gains would primarily come from Bloc-held ridings in areas where CPC isn't competitive (Montreal suburbs, francophone areas). This means the Bloc's decline doesn't necessarily help CPC's relative position against them.\n\nForecaster 2's point about vote efficiency is crucial - the CPC's regionally concentrated support (Quebec City, Beauce) limits their seat ceiling regardless of province-wide polling. The Bloc's distributed francophone support converts more efficiently to seats across multiple regions.\n\nHowever, I think Forecaster 3 at 85% may be slightly overconfident given the Bloc has lost 10-14 percentage points in support (37% to 23-27%). While this mainly benefits Liberals, such significant erosion indicates vulnerability. Forecaster 2 at 65% seems too cautious given the structural advantages and seat models.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating upward based on three key factors I insufficiently weighted: (1) Historical seat results showing consistent 3:1 Bloc advantage over two elections, (2) Current seat projection models showing BQ at 19-25 vs CPC at 10-12, meaning even worst-case scenarios favor the Bloc by meaningful margins, and (3) The critical insight that Liberal gains cannibalize Bloc seats in areas where CPC isn't competitive, so Bloc erosion doesn't help CPC's relative position.\n\nThe CPC's structural challenge is more severe than I initially appreciated - their support is geographically concentrated in specific regions (Quebec City, Beauce) making it exceptionally difficult to expand their seat count. The Bloc's francophone support, while weakened, remains more efficiently distributed across multiple regions.\n\nI'm not going as high as 85% because: (1) The Bloc's significant polling decline (losing 10-14 points) represents real vulnerability that could continue, (2) Several months remain for dynamics to shift, (3) Polling gaps have narrowed considerably from historical norms, which could eventually translate to seats.\n\nMy updated forecast balances the strong structural and historical case for a Bloc advantage with appropriate caution about their recent erosion and remaining uncertainty.",
