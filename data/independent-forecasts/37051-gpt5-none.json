    "no_outcome_scenario": "IRS opens or continues an examination, political pressure and media scrutiny persist, but no final revocation action occurs before July 1. Harvard retains 501(c)(3) status, perhaps with compliance commitments or nothing public at all.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unprecedented, accelerated IRS action issues a Final Adverse Determination revoking Harvard’s 501(c)(3) status effective before July 1, or Harvard voluntarily surrenders its status (both extremely unlikely).",
    "rationale": "The base rate for revoking 501(c)(3) status of large, longstanding universities is effectively near-zero; there is no modern precedent of a major research university losing exemption. IRS revocations generally follow audits, proposed adverse determinations, a protest/appeals window, and sometimes litigation—processes that typically take months to years, not weeks. With roughly two months left, the institutional, legal, and procedural inertia strongly favors the status quo. Even with public threats from the White House (per the NYT article on April 15, 2025), the IRS is designed to operate with procedural safeguards and due process. If an attempted revocation were launched, Harvard would immediately litigate; while a court injunction might or might not technically restore status for resolution purposes, the more fundamental point is that getting to a final, effective revocation before July 1 is highly improbable. Grounds for revocation (e.g., prohibited political campaign intervention, substantial lobbying, private inurement, or non-exempt purpose) would need to be clear and egregious; Harvard has ample compliance resources to avoid or remediate such issues. Congressional action narrowly targeting a single entity is also highly unlikely to pass and be effective before July 1. Research assistant provided no additional information beyond the cited NYT story, which I interpret as political pressure rather than evidence of imminent IRS action. Why not higher: the due-process timeline, lack of precedent, and institutional constraints dominate. Why not lower (not zero): explicit presidential rhetoric and a polarized environment create a small tail risk of extraordinary or irregular action by Treasury/IRS. What would move me upward: credible reporting that IRS EO has opened an examination with intent to revoke, issuance of a proposed adverse determination letter specific to Harvard, public signals from Treasury/IRS leadership about expedited action, or clear, documented violations by Harvard. What would move me downward: statements from IRS affirming standard process/independence, absence of any examination news by late May, or credible reporting that any federal pressure is focusing on other tools (e.g., targeted excise taxes) rather than exemption revocation.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
