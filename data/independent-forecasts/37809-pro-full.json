  "information": "As of mid-to-late May 2025, New York Yankees player Aaron Judge had a batting average at or above .400. Reports from May 20th list his average as .401, while other reports from the preceding week cited it as high as .410 and .423. Through his first 46 games, he had a batting average of 0.401. His Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP) was .481, compared to his career average of .344. Statcast data calculated his expected batting average (xBA) at approximately .362.\n\nAs of May 18, 2025, Freddie Freeman of the Los Angeles Dodgers led the National League with a batting average of .375. Other top hitters in the NL included Will Smith (.336), Brendan Donovan (.330), and Manny Machado (.323). One report also listed Shohei Ohtani's average at .370. In contrast, three-time All-Star Marcus Semien was batting .174 for the Texas Rangers.\n\nHistorically, maintaining a .400 batting average is extremely rare in modern baseball. No MLB player has finished a season batting .400 since Ted Williams in 1941. Furthermore, no player in the last 25 seasons has had a batting average of .400 or greater on July 1. In 2023, Luis Arraez's average was .401 on June 23 but fell to .392 by July 1. Factors contributing to this difficulty include lower league-wide Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP), which is .288 in the current era compared to .300 in 1930.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Judge's current .401 batting average experiences a natural regression to the mean over the next six weeks, influenced by his unsustainable Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP). No other player manages to mount the historic hitting streak required to reach a .400 average by the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A player, most likely Aaron Judge, defies statistical expectations and historical precedent by continuing an exceptionally hot streak for the next six weeks, maintaining a batting average at or above .400 through the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by strong historical precedent and statistical principles. The most significant factor is that no MLB player has had a batting average of .400 or greater on July 1 in the last 25 seasons. This establishes a powerful base rate suggesting a 'No' outcome is highly likely.\n\nThe current case of Aaron Judge, while impressive, shows signs of being unsustainable. His .401 average is supported by a .481 Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP), which is drastically higher than his career average of .344. This suggests a significant degree of luck that is likely to regress to the mean. Furthermore, his expected batting average (xBA) of .362, while elite, is well below the .400 threshold, indicating his underlying performance does not fully support his current batting average.\n\nThe recent case of Luis Arraez in 2023, who was batting over .400 in late June before falling below the mark by July 1, serves as a direct and recent parallel that highlights the difficulty of maintaining such a high average.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 8% because a player is currently meeting the condition. Aaron Judge is an elite hitter, and while improbable, it is not impossible for him to sustain this performance for another six weeks. The fact that the threshold has been met in late May warrants a non-trivial probability.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the combined weight of historical data, statistical regression (especially BABIP), and relevant recent examples like Arraez strongly suggests that Judge's average will decline. To maintain a .400 average, a player must consistently get hits at a rate that has been unachievable in the modern baseball era over this duration.\n\nI would raise my forecast if Judge's xBA significantly increased toward the .400 mark, suggesting a more sustainable skill-based performance. I would lower my forecast if his average drops below .390 in the next couple of weeks, as the difficulty of raising it back to .400 increases with every at-bat.",
