    "review": "Both forecasters raised critical information I had not considered. Most importantly, Forecaster 2 revealed that Ethiopia was previously AT Level 4 and was DOWNGRADED to Level 3 in early 2023 - showing a positive trajectory rather than deterioration. Additionally, the April 30, 2025 review (just 2 days ago) explicitly confirmed Ethiopia is not among the 21 Level 4 countries. This timing is crucial - it means the State Department very recently reaffirmed Ethiopia's Level 3 status. Forecaster 3's point about May 1st sanctions is concerning but must be weighed against the lack of catastrophic incidents (no nationwide offensives, coup attempts, or mass-casualty events involving foreigners). The regional vs nationwide distinction (specific areas have Level 4 but not the whole country) suggests the State Department takes a nuanced approach. Both forecasters arrived at slightly higher probabilities (10% and 13%) than my 6%, but I believe the weight of evidence - particularly the 2023 downgrade history and the 2-day-old review - argues for staying at or below my original estimate rather than updating upward.",
    "rationale": "The most significant new information is that Ethiopia was downgraded FROM Level 4 TO Level 3 in early 2023. This means the State Department actively decided Ethiopia no longer met Level 4 criteria just two years ago. To upgrade back to Level 4 within 60 days would require reversing this recent decision. The April 30 review confirming no Level 4 status adds another layer of status quo bias - agencies rarely reverse major policy decisions within weeks absent extraordinary circumstances. While the May 1st sanctions indicate renewed US concern, they occurred AFTER the April 30 review and haven't been accompanied by the severe catalysts that typically trigger Level 4 (embassy evacuations, attacks on Americans, airport closures, coups). The historical base rate of 2-4 upgrades per year from ~30 Level 3 countries, combined with only 60 days remaining, suggests 1-3% from pure statistics. I adjust upward from base rate due to sanctions and ongoing regional conflicts, but the recent downgrade history and 2-day-old review strengthen the case that status quo will hold. The regional Level 4 warnings for specific areas show the State Department already has mechanisms to warn about localized dangers without nationwide escalation.",
