    "review": "The other two forecasters provide analyses that are highly aligned with my own, identifying the same core drivers for a 'No' outcome: the extremely short timeline of one month, the complete lack of any campaign groundwork (FEC filings, staff, etc.), Representative Norman's publicly stated focus on the 2026 governor's race, and the strength of the incumbent, Senator Graham, who has secured key endorsements. There is a strong consensus on the reasoning. The only point of divergence is the final probability, with Forecaster 2 matching my initial 5% and Forecaster 3 arguing for a lower 2%. I found Forecaster 3's reasoning particularly convincing, especially the added context that the governor's race is a 'more politically viable path' due to term limits. This strengthens the argument that Norman's focus is genuinely elsewhere and not a feint.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 5% to 2%. The consensus on the overwhelming evidence for a 'No' outcome is clear. However, Forecaster 3's slightly lower probability is better calibrated to the situation. My initial 5% accounted for general political unpredictability, but the arguments presented have convinced me that the specific circumstances here warrant a lower estimate. The combination of an extremely short deadline, explicit public denials, a complete absence of logistical preparation, and the existence of a more attractive and viable alternative race (for Governor) makes a sudden reversal and Senate campaign launch a truly remote, black swan-type event. A 2% probability, or a 1-in-50 chance, more accurately reflects this extreme unlikelihood than a 5% (1-in-20) chance.",
