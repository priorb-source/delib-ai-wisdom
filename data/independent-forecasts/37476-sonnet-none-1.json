    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 53 days (from May 9, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - GoPro does not file for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GoPro continues operations through June 2025, managing its financial obligations through existing cash reserves, credit facilities, or potential restructuring agreements. The company may be struggling but maintains sufficient liquidity to avoid an immediate bankruptcy filing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GoPro's financial condition deteriorates rapidly due to inability to meet debt obligations, vendor payments, or operational expenses. The company exhausts available financing options and files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to reorganize, or Chapter 7 to liquidate, within the next 53 days.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome since corporate bankruptcies by publicly traded companies are relatively rare events in any short timeframe. Several factors support a low probability: (1) The timeframe is extremely short at only 53 days, (2) Bankruptcy filings typically have warning signs visible in advance through financial disclosures, credit rating changes, or market signals, (3) Even financially distressed companies often have access to emergency financing, asset sales, or restructuring options that can forestall immediate bankruptcy. The research assistant provided no additional information suggesting imminent distress. While the question references GoPro's Q4 2024 earnings report, without specific evidence of acute liquidity crisis, covenant violations, or inability to service debt, the base rate for bankruptcy in such a short window remains very low. GoPro has faced challenges historically but has managed to avoid bankruptcy. My forecast is not higher because there's no concrete evidence of imminent filing - such information would typically be public through SEC filings, press releases, or market sources. My forecast is not lower (not closer to 0%) because the question's existence suggests possible concerns about GoPro's financial health, and rapid deterioration, while unlikely, is possible. I would update significantly higher if I saw evidence of: liquidity crisis, debt covenant breaches, vendor payment failures, mass layoffs, or executives discussing bankruptcy as an option. I would update lower with evidence of: new financing secured, positive cash flow trends, or successful cost restructuring.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill GoPro file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and 2024 Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000150043525000003/gpro2024-12x31exh991xer.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
