    "review": "Forecaster 2’s direction-of-travel matches my priors: post-2020 NUFORC reports have trended lower, and recent Junes are typically sub-400 unless there’s a trigger. However, some of their specifics look internally inconsistent (e.g., citing June 2022 = 326 yet also implying a June median of ~396 for 2019–2023, which doesn’t line up with their own list). Still, the qualitative takeaway (recent baseline <400) is credible. The “Contact in the Desert” conference seems, at best, a weak catalyst for actual sightings. Forecaster 3’s claims (e.g., all 2023 months >600, June 2022 = 603, sustained 2024–2025 months all >450) conflict with widely reported post-2020 declines and are inconsistent with other sources I’ve seen; I heavily discount that analysis. Neither forecaster addressed the July 1 measurement cutoff and NUFORC posting lags, which biases the resolution slightly downward for June counts.",
    "rationale": "Key points unchanged: (1) Seasonality favors summer, but July is typically the peak; June is strong but not the strongest. (2) The July 1 snapshot creates downside risk because late-June submissions often post after month-end. (3) Recent baseline appears below 400 without a clear catalyst. Starlink trains, re-entries, or a viral high-profile incident could push a one-month spike, but that’s speculative. Forecaster 2’s directional evidence reinforces a sub-400 baseline and the need for an unusual catalyst to clear 400. I discount Forecaster 3’s optimistic dataset as likely inaccurate. Given this, I nudge my estimate slightly downward. Triggers that would move me up: clear early-to-mid-June spikes in NUFORC postings, widely visible Starlink trains over multiple U.S. evenings, or a viral, multi-state event that drives contemporaneous reporting (and timely posting before July 1). Absent that, the most likely outcome remains under 400.",
