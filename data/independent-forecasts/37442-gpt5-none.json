    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~9 days (13F due by May 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Berkshire reports the same 2,382,000 shares (or fewer), which is not greater than the threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire holds the DPZ position steady at 2,382,000 shares or trims it; or it seeks confidential treatment while building, so the Q1 13F does not show a figure above 2,382,000.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire (likely Combs/Weschler) adds to Domino’s during Q1 2025 and reports a holding above 2,382,000 shares in the May 15 13F.",
    "rationale": "Time is short until the filing, and the base case for Berkshire after initiating a position is often to hold steady for at least a quarter unless they are intentionally building. Q1 2025 equity markets were elevated, and at Berkshire’s May meeting Buffett emphasized a lack of attractive opportunities and suggested they were net sellers, which reduces the odds of adding to DPZ. Domino’s shares were strong into early 2025, making incremental buying less likely. Also, if a stake were being built materially, Berkshire might seek confidential treatment, which would not produce a reported increase in the public 13F and thus resolve as No. On the other hand, Berkshire sometimes scales into new positions over several quarters, and a modest add above 2,382,000 is plausible if they view DPZ as a long-term compounder and found brief Q1 dips to buy. I have no extra signals (the research assistant found nothing new), and I’ve seen no contemporaneous media or regulatory hints (e.g., a Berkshire 13G) that would indicate a larger DPZ build. That keeps the probability below 50%. It’s not lower because (1) Berkshire has a pattern of occasionally adding to fresh holdings, (2) the add needed to clear the threshold could be small, and (3) the decision could be driven by a lieutenant with autonomy. I would raise the probability if there were credible reports or filings indicating accumulation (e.g., hints of a Berkshire 13G or on-the-record comments about adding to consumer staples/quick-service names), or evidence of notable price dips in Q1 that align with Berkshire’s buying behavior. I would lower it further if there were confirmation Berkshire broadly reduced equities in Q1 beyond Apple, if DPZ rallied sharply throughout Q1 with little opportunity to add, or if there were signs of confidential treatment being used for DPZ (which would imply no reported increase).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Domino's Pizza stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nRetailWire: [Domino’s Pizza Stake Purchased by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Group](https://retailwire.com/dominos-pizza-warren-buffett/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 2,382,000 shares of Domino's Pizza, Inc. (ticker symbol DPZ).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
