  "information": "The recalled chicken Caesar wraps were distributed to vending machines located in office buildings within the state of Washington. The labeling issue was discovered by the company during a routine quality assurance check of ingredient labels. As of early May 2025, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions or illnesses due to the consumption of these products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has urged consumers and offices not to consume or serve the products and to either return them or dispose of them.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 24 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall remains Active",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall remains Active through June 1, 2025 because FSIS has not yet completed its verification processes, the company has not fully demonstrated corrective actions, or administrative procedures are still pending. Given that 2.5 months have already elapsed since the February 24 recall without closure, the remaining bureaucratic and verification steps extend beyond the May deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recall is changed to Closed status before June 1, 2025 because the limited distribution scope (vending machines in Washington state only) allowed for quick product removal, the company successfully demonstrated corrective actions to prevent future misbranding, FSIS completed its verification procedures, and with no reported illnesses, the agency determined the public health concern was adequately addressed.",
    "rationale": "The recall has been active for approximately 2.5 months (from February 24 to May 8, 2025), yet remains open. This suggests either ongoing verification processes or administrative requirements that have not yet been satisfied. The status quo bias strongly favors the recall remaining active, as it hasn't closed despite substantial time passing. However, several factors create moderate upside probability: (1) the limited distribution scope to vending machines in one state should facilitate faster product removal and verification, (2) no reported adverse reactions suggests lower public health urgency but also simpler resolution, (3) the company discovered the issue internally, indicating functional quality controls that may speed corrective action approval, and (4) with 24 days remaining, there is still meaningful time for closure. Against closure: FSIS recalls involve multiple verification steps including confirmation of product removal, root cause analysis, corrective action implementation, and administrative closure procedures. The fact that 10+ weeks have passed without closure suggests these processes are not yet complete. Industry-typical recall closure timelines vary widely, and without specific information suggesting imminent closure, the base rate favors continuation of the current active status. My forecast is not higher because there's no evidence the closure is imminent or that standard procedures have been expedited. It's not lower because the limited scope and elapsed time do create reasonable probability of closure within 24 days. Evidence of company communications with FSIS about closure timeline, or precedents for similar small-scope recalls, would shift my forecast significantly.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe recalled chicken Caesar wraps were distributed to vending machines located in office buildings within the state of Washington. The labeling issue was discovered by the company during a routine quality assurance check of ingredient labels. As of early May 2025, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions or illnesses due to the consumption of these products.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
