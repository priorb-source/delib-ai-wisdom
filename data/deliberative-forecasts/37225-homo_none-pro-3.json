    "review": "Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 provide analyses that are structurally identical to my own. We have all identified the same central dynamic: the unpopularity of the incumbent Progressive Reform Party (VHP) due to its economic austerity program, versus the profound structural weakness of its primary challenger, the National Democratic Party (NDP), whose leader is a convicted fugitive. No new evidence or arguments were raised that I had not previously considered. However, the key takeaway from this deliberation is the convergence of their independent forecasts at 65%, while my initial forecast was slightly more confident at 70%. This consensus from my peers is a valuable signal, suggesting that I may have been slightly overweighting the opposition's weakness and underweighting the potential for a powerful anti-incumbent vote driven by economic hardship.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 70% to 65%. My core reasoning remains unchanged: the VHP benefits immensely from the disarray of the NDP, which is the only party that has historically been able to mount a challenge on a similar scale. However, the deliberation has convinced me to give more weight to the downside risks for the incumbent government. The fact that two other experts independently arrived at a more cautious 65% forecast serves as a check on my initial confidence. The economic pain caused by the VHP's policies is a potent motivator for voters, and I now believe there is a slightly higher probability than I first estimated that this discontent could consolidate behind an alternative, such as Ronnie Brunswijk's ABOP, or that depressed turnout among disillusioned VHP supporters could allow another party to win a plurality with a lower share of the vote. This 5-point downward revision reflects an adjustment for this increased uncertainty and brings my forecast in line with the group's consensus.",
