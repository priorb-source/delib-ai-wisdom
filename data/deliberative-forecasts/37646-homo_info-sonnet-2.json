    "review": "Both forecasters raise important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2 provides crucial timeline specificity - the April 13 announcement means we're already 4-5 weeks in without seeing 'Available' status appear on the map. This is a significant negative signal. Forecaster 2's emphasis on status quo bias is well-taken: the fact that nothing has changed after a month suggests we're not on a rapid deployment track. Forecaster 3 makes a valuable technical point about inter-satellite links eliminating the need for in-country ground stations, which reduces infrastructure barriers somewhat. However, all forecasters agree operational requirements (payment systems, distribution, local partnerships) still create deployment friction. The key disagreement centers on how to weight the status quo versus the possibility of rapid deployment. Forecaster 2's 60% seems overly optimistic given that we're at week 5 with no map updates and the African base rate is 16-32 weeks. Forecaster 3's 40% feels more calibrated. My initial 20% may have been too pessimistic by not giving enough weight to the 6.5 weeks remaining and the Bangladesh precedent showing rapid deployment is technically feasible.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm updating upward from 20% but remaining more conservative than the other forecasters. The critical new information is that we're 4-5 weeks post-announcement with no 'Available' status appearing - this suggests we're not on Bangladesh's 2-week track. However, 6.5 weeks remaining is still meaningful time. The African base rate (4-8 months) strongly argues against meeting the deadline, but counterbalancing factors include: (1) the Bangladesh precedent demonstrating technical capability for rapid deployment, (2) the license approval is confirmed, removing regulatory uncertainty, and (3) we don't know if preparation began before the April 13 announcement. Somalia's challenging environment (infrastructure, security, payment systems) makes it unlikely to be prioritized for ultra-fast deployment. The lack of map changes after a month is the strongest negative signal - it suggests deployment complexity rather than imminent availability. I'm settling on 30%, giving modest weight to the remaining timeframe and technical feasibility while heavily weighting the unfavorable status quo and African deployment base rates.",
