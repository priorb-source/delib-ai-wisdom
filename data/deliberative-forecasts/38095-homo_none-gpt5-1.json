    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize month-level base rates (roughly 15–25% for >2 grants in any given month in Trump’s first term) and the lack of concrete signals for June. Forecaster 3 adds a useful point I underweighted: disclosure timing risk—actions taken late June could be publicly reported in early July, which wouldn’t count. They also stress July 4 as a more natural symbolic target than anything in June, and that early-term months often see less activity. These arguments temper my earlier catalyst-driven view (birthday, SCOTUS end-of-term) and make my prior 47% look too high absent fresh reporting.",
    "rationale": "We are two days from June with no credible leaks of a June clemency tranche. Historically, Trump’s clemency comes in bursts, but most months still see ≤2 grants; a reasonable base rate is near 20%. June does offer plausible hooks (Juneteenth, June 14 birthday, potential late-June court decisions), and the threshold is low (>2), keeping real upside if he opts for even a modest batch or a targeted/blanket action (e.g., J6). However, the lack of contemporaneous signals, the plausibility of aiming for July 4, and the disclosure-timing risk all push the probability below my initial estimate. I still keep it meaningfully above the simple base rate because (a) media signals suggest an active clemency environment in 2025, and (b) Trump’s episodic style means that when he acts, exceeding three is common. Netting these, I move down from 47% to mid-30s.",
