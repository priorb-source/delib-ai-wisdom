    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identified the central tension between the severe status quo drought and the impending rainy/hurricane season. The other two forecasters provided a similar analysis to my own but assigned a higher probability to the 'Yes' outcome. Their reasoning, particularly the shared emphasis on the inertia of the severe drought, was very convincing. Forecaster 3 made a particularly sharp point that an *average* start to the rainy season would likely be insufficient to reduce the drought-affected population by the necessary 500,000. They compellingly argued that overcoming the significant rainfall deficit (6-10 inches in some areas) in just one month requires an anomalously wet June, not just a typical one. This is a crucial consideration that I had previously under-weighted.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of the other forecasters, I am updating my forecast. My initial reasoning correctly identified the core factors, but I now believe I assigned too much weight to the potential for the upcoming rainy season to rapidly reverse the situation. The other two forecasters cogently argued that the severity and depth of the current drought create significant inertia. A rainfall deficit of 6-10 inches is substantial and is unlikely to be erased in just four weeks, even with average seasonal rainfall. This insight, combined with the specific NOAA forecast for drought persistence in South Florida through June, makes a 'Yes' outcome more probable than I first estimated. The current number of residents in drought (14.5M) is only 500,000 above the threshold, but reversing conditions for that many people requires significant, widespread precipitation. While a tropical system remains a key uncertainty that could lead to a 'No' outcome, relying on such an event within a specific one-month window is speculative. The more likely scenario is that even with the onset of the wet season, the recovery will be too slow to drop the number below 14.0 million by June 28. Therefore, I am increasing my probability from 65% to 75%, aligning with Forecaster 2 and acknowledging the stronger case for persistence.",
