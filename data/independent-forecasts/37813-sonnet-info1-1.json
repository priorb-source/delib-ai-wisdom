  "information": "According to multiple news outlets, U.S. government bodies have documented 757 cases of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) between May 2023 and June 2024. Of this total, 708 occurred in airspace, and only 49 cases had been officially closed as of early 2025. The Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is the primary body for receiving these reports. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also investigates UAP sightings, especially those confirmed by radar, and shares its findings with the Department of Defense.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days until outcome is known (June 2025 starts in 10 days, runs for 30 days, and outcome will be verified on or after July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NUFORC continues receiving and posting UFO reports at typical rates, with cube-shaped sightings occurring occasionally but not every month, given their described rarity in NUFORC's history",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes without any witnesses reporting cube-shaped UFOs to NUFORC, or reports are submitted but not processed/posted by July 1, 2025. This could occur if the typical low base rate of cube-shaped sightings results in zero such reports for that particular month, or if reporting patterns shift toward other shapes (spheres, triangles, lights, etc.)",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one person witnesses and reports what they perceive as a cube-shaped UFO/UAP to NUFORC during June 2025, and NUFORC processes and posts this report to their website by July 1, 2025. Given that December 2024 had 6 such reports, even a fraction of that activity would satisfy the resolution criteria",
    "rationale": "The critical anchor point is that December 2024 had 6 cube-shaped UFO sightings reported to NUFORC, which the question characterizes as 'rare in the history of NUFORC.' This establishes several key facts: (1) cube-shaped sightings do occur and are being reported to NUFORC, (2) they can occur multiple times in a single month, and (3) they are uncommon but not extremely rare. The resolution threshold is deliberately low - requiring only ONE cube-shaped sighting in June 2025, not multiple. Given that December 2024 had 6, even with significant month-to-month variation or regression to the mean, the probability of having at least 1 in June seems moderate to moderately high. However, several factors prevent a higher forecast: the term 'rare' suggests these sightings don't happen every month; we lack data on the frequency in other recent months to establish a clear trend; December might have been an anomaly; and seasonal or other factors we cannot account for might affect June specifically. The forecast is not lower because: the recent evidence from December 2024 is strong and temporally close; the threshold is only 1 sighting, not 6; and NUFORC appears to be actively processing reports based on the research assistant's information about increased UAP attention from government bodies. I would update upward if I learned that January-May 2025 also showed elevated cube sighting rates, or if there was evidence of increased public interest in UFO reporting. I would update downward if December 2024 was confirmed as a statistical outlier or if typical months show zero cube-shaped reports",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the National UFO Reporting Center report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a report of a sighting of a UFO/UAP shaped like a cube in June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nFor example, although rare in the history of NUFORC, the month of December 2024 [had](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202412) six sightings with a cube shape.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple news outlets, U.S. government bodies have documented 757 cases of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) between May 2023 and June 2024. Of this total, 708 occurred in airspace, and only 49 cases had been officially closed as of early 2025. The Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is the primary body for receiving these reports. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also investigates UAP sightings, especially those confirmed by radar, and shares its findings with the Department of Defense.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
