    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: strong status-quo inertia, short timeline, and high legal/diplomatic costs vs. meaningful but not decisive pressures (financial distress at Bulgargaz, political rhetoric, and the possibility of an EU dimension). The new element they highlighted more explicitly is the EU antitrust angle and, importantly, the resolution criterion only requiring an announcement (not a consummated legal termination). That latter point does modestly raise odds. I agree with their caution that governments often prefer renegotiation or arbitration, and that even if action is taken it often slips past a few-week window. I also note the subtle but important distinction that many “tough” statements telegraph intent to terminate or seek arbitration rather than declaring the agreement cancelled effective immediately—wording that might not satisfy resolution criteria. Overall, their reasoning is sound and consistent with my view; I find a slight upward nudge warranted to reflect the announcement-only trigger and the reported financial stress.",
    "rationale": "Time left is very short (~3.5 weeks), which heavily favors No by inertia. The agreement is long-term and legally sticky; abrupt cancellation risks penalties, litigation, and diplomatic costs, and would typically require preparation and internal alignment. BOTAS’s commercial incentives also point toward leverage (default notices, suspension threats) over outright cancellation. That said, tail risks are real: Bulgargaz’s reported financial strain, political calls to exit, and any EU-related scrutiny can catalyze sharp moves. Crucially, the resolution counts a unilateral announcement even if disputed, which makes a political declaration the key pathway to Yes. Offsetting that, officials often choose formulations like “we will initiate termination” or “we will seek to annul” rather than “the deal is cancelled,” and such phrasing may not resolve Yes. I’m therefore keeping the probability low but nudging it up to reflect the ‘announcement-only’ path and convergent views from other forecasters. I would move higher on credible reports of imminent cabinet action or default-triggered notices indicating termination; I would move lower on signs of standstill/forbearance or structured renegotiation.",
