    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic continues iterating on the Claude 3.x line (e.g., further 3.5/3.7 updates), teases or tests Claude 4 with select partners or a waitlisted preview only, and schedules general availability for later in 2025 (Q3/Q4).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic announces Claude 4 in June and immediately makes it generally available via claude.ai and/or the API (no waitlist), possibly to all users or at least to anyone who signs up for a paid tier; the model name includes “Claude” and “4.”",
    "rationale": "- Base rates and cadence: Anthropic’s major releases have come roughly every 6–12 months (Claude 2 → 3 in ~8 months, then multiple 3.x iterations). A jump to “Claude 4” around mid-2025 is plausible but not guaranteed. With only ~1.5 months left, the status quo (no general release yet) slightly favors a No outcome.\n- Naming requirement: The question requires the public-facing model name to include both “Claude” and “4.” Iterative 3.x releases do not satisfy resolution. A new brand like “Claude Next” without a “4” would also not count.\n- Access criterion: It must be accessible to the general public without a waitlist or closed early-access. Availability via claude.ai or public API (including paid plans open to anyone) would count; enterprise-only or invite-only would not.\n- Competitive pressure: Rival model launches (e.g., recent OpenAI/Google updates) create some incentive for Anthropic to ship a major upgrade by late Q2. If Claude 4 is already in partner testing, a swift GA is feasible, pushing probability upward.\n- Why not higher: No clear, public pre-announcement or definitive signals (as of today) indicating an imminent GA within weeks; Anthropic often emphasizes safety and may phase releases (preview → enterprise → GA), which could miss the July 1 deadline.\n- Why not lower: The historical cadence makes a mid-2025 release plausible; Anthropic has previously flipped new models to broad access on claude.ai quickly. A mid-June launch window is still open.\n- What would move me up: Credible leaks or documentation showing a “claude-4” model ID in SDKs/docs; press invites or Anthropic blog/event announcements for late May/June with GA language; evidence that internal previews have completed and safety gates cleared.\n- What would move me down: Signals that Anthropic will extend 3.x (e.g., another 3.5/3.7 iteration) instead of 4; mentions of waitlisted/enterprise-only access; safety or regulatory delays; infrastructure or pricing changes framing Claude 4 for H2 only.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information available, so I rely on base rates, recent industry cadence, and the short time window.\nOn balance, the short remaining window and lack of strong public indicators keep No as the status quo, but competitive dynamics and plausible readiness keep a material chance of a June GA.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
