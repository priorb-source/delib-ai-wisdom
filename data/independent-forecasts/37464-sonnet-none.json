    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 24 days (from May 8, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall remains Active through June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall investigation continues beyond June 1, 2025. This could occur if product recovery from vending machines is incomplete, corrective actions by LPK1 have not been fully implemented or verified, or FSIS has not completed its verification process to confirm all requirements for closure have been met.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "FSIS changes the recall status to Closed before June 1, 2025. This would happen if all affected chicken Caesar wrap products have been successfully recovered from Washington vending machines, LPK1 has implemented satisfactory corrective actions to prevent future misbranding and allergen issues, and FSIS has completed verification that all closure requirements have been satisfied.",
    "rationale": "This recall was issued on February 24, 2025, meaning approximately 2.5 months have elapsed as of today (May 8, 2025). The recall involves ready-to-eat chicken Caesar wraps with undeclared fish allergen sold through vending machines in Washington state - a relatively limited and trackable distribution channel compared to widespread retail distribution. With only 24 days remaining until the resolution date, the key question is whether this timeframe is sufficient for closure given the current Active status. Favorable factors: The limited geographic scope (Washington only) and specific distribution channel (vending machines) should facilitate easier product recovery compared to broader retail recalls. The 2.5 months that have already elapsed represents a reasonable timeframe for completing recovery efforts and implementing corrective actions. Vending machine operators are typically easier to identify and contact than tracking products through retail chains. Unfavorable factors: The recall remains Active after 2.5 months, suggesting either the investigation is taking its normal bureaucratic course or there are complicating factors. The 24-day window is relatively short for completing all remaining steps if substantial work remains. USDA/FSIS verification processes can be time-consuming, involving inspection of corrective actions and documentation review. Without specific information about current recovery rates, corrective action status, or FSIS verification progress, I must rely on the status quo bias - the recall is Active and likely remains so absent specific evidence of imminent closure. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the recall is still Active after a substantial period, (2) only 24 days remain, and (3) no information suggests the closure process is imminent. My forecast is not lower because: (1) the limited distribution makes recovery feasible, (2) 2.5-3 months is within the range of typical recall durations for similar issues, and (3) the vending machine channel provides clear tracking. For an upward revision, I would need evidence of completed corrective actions, high recovery rates, or FSIS verification nearing completion. For a downward revision, I would need information about complications, slow progress, or expanded scope.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
