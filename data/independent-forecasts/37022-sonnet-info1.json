  "information": "The latest published value for Ukraine's government debt for February 2025 was 1.869 trillion UAH. The threshold for the question to resolve as 'Yes' is 1.900 trillion UAH, necessitating a month-on-month increase of at least 30.5 billion UAH. Historical data from 2024-2025 shows that the typical monthly net change in debt ranged from a decrease of 10 billion UAH to an increase of 110 billion UAH. The median monthly increase during this period was approximately 25 billion UAH, and the increase from January to February 2025 was 18.5 billion UAH. In seven of the twelve months preceding March 2025, the monthly increase was 30 billion UAH or greater.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The March 2025 data should be published very soon, if not already available. Government debt statistics are typically released with a 1-2 month lag, so the outcome may already be determined but not yet reported by Trading Economics.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - If Ukraine's debt increases by the median monthly amount of approximately 25 billion UAH from February 2025, it would reach 1.894 trillion UAH, which is below the 1.900 trillion UAH threshold required for a Yes resolution.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine's government debt increases by less than 30.5 billion UAH from February to March 2025, possibly due to lower-than-expected wartime borrowing, successful fiscal consolidation measures, or debt repayments exceeding new issuances. This would keep the debt below 1.900 trillion UAH.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine's government debt increases by at least 30.5 billion UAH from February to March 2025, potentially driven by increased wartime expenditure financing, large bond issuances, or external loans (rather than grants). This would push the debt to or above 1.900 trillion UAH.",
    "rationale": "Starting from February 2025's 1.869 trillion UAH, Ukraine needs a 30.5 billion UAH increase to reach the 1.900 trillion threshold. The research assistant's data shows the median monthly increase was approximately 25 billion UAH, which would fall short at 1.894 trillion. The most recent month-on-month change (January to February 2025) was only 18.5 billion UAH, also below the required increase. However, there's significant evidence of volatility: in 7 of the 12 months preceding March 2025 (58% of observations), the monthly increase was 30 billion UAH or greater, and the range spanned from -10 to +110 billion UAH. This suggests substantial variability in Ukraine's debt dynamics, likely driven by wartime financing needs. The status quo outcome points toward NO - both the median increase and most recent trend fall short of the threshold. What would make me more confident in YES: evidence of large March bond issuances or accelerated external borrowing. What would make me more confident in NO: signs of fiscal tightening or debt restructuring in early 2025. Given the evidence slightly favors the status quo outcome while acknowledging meaningful historical precedent for the required increase, I assess the probability at 43%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's government debt be at least 1.90 trillion UAH in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's government debt is greater than or equal to 1.90 billion UAH Thousand (in other words, 1.90 trillion Ukrainian hryvnia for the month of March 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/government-debt). Under 1.90 billion UAH Thousand resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe latest published value for Ukraine's government debt for February 2025 was 1.869 trillion UAH. The threshold for the question to resolve as 'Yes' is 1.900 trillion UAH, necessitating a month-on-month increase of at least 30.5 billion UAH.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
