    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most critical piece of evidence I had missed: February 2025 total exports were $278.5 billion, already exceeding the April 2024 threshold of $262.578 billion by roughly $16 billion (6%). This provides a substantial cushion. Combined with my observation that March goods exports grew 1.2% from February to $180.8 billion, the trend through February-March appears positive or at least stable.\n\nForecaster 2's analysis is concerning but may overweight the immediate impact of April 2 tariffs. While the 45% China-US shipping booking decline is severe, export shipments in April largely reflect orders placed weeks or months earlier. The tariff impact would more likely manifest in May-June exports rather than fully materializing in April.\n\nThe key calculation: For April to fall below the $262.578B threshold when February was at $278.5B would require approximately a 6% decline in just two months. Given March goods showed growth, this would necessitate either a sharp March-April reversal or a significant collapse in services exports—possible but not the most likely scenario given available data.",
    "rationale": "Synthesizing all evidence: (1) February 2025 established a strong baseline at $278.5B, well above threshold; (2) March goods exports continued growing at 1.2% month-over-month; (3) Historical patterns show 79-93% of Aprils demonstrate YoY growth; (4) April 2 tariff implementation affects the month but export fulfillment often lags orders by weeks; (5) The 45% shipping booking decline and retaliatory measures are concerning but represent forward-looking indicators more than April actuals.\n\nI'm updating moderately downward from 68% to 60% because: Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that nearly a full month operated under the tariff regime, increasing the probability of disruption beyond my initial estimate. The shipping data, manufacturing contraction, and retaliatory environment create meaningful downside risk. However, I'm not going as low as 8% because the February-March data shows resilience and provides a substantial cushion. The question requires not growth but simply not collapsing by 6%+ in two months, which remains more likely than not given the buffer and momentum.",
