    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same key drivers I used: short horizon, institutional inertia, statutory basis, and that past restrictive periods didn’t remove the DV instructions pages. They add a useful nuance on resolution wording—Metaculus requires the Step 1 “Submit an Entry” page with instructions at the exact path, so a redirect or a content swap to a termination/notice page could resolve No. They also correctly identify that the primary downside is technical/IA change rather than policy. I agree with their framing and weightings; Forecaster 3’s slightly lower estimate seems to place a bit more weight on content replacement/URL change risk, but I still see that tail as small over a ~6‑week window.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~6 weeks to July 1, 2025.\n- Status quo: DV‑2026 results posted in May; Entrant Status Check runs through Sept 2026; State routinely keeps the DV instruction pages up year‑round with “entry closed” notes.\n- No outcome scenario: Rapid congressional repeal enacted and implemented before July 1 leading State to replace the Step 1 page with a termination notice lacking registration instructions; or a site reorg changes the exact URL (404/redirect); or rare outage at time of check.\n- Yes outcome scenario: Normal operations continue; page remains live at the same path with instructions (even if the entry period is closed) as historically observed.\n- Assessment: Legislative/policy risk by July 1 is low even under an administration opposing DV; enactment plus immediate web content removal is unlikely on this timeline. The main risk is technical (URL change/redirect or content rewritten to a notice that removes instructions). Given the very short horizon and historical stability of travel.state.gov IA, I keep this as a small tail. I already incorporated this risk in my prior estimate and find Forecaster 2’s 93% well‑calibrated; I don’t see new evidence warranting a move.\n",
