  "information": "Recent company-specific developments include Tesla receiving a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) based on declining earnings estimate revisions. Its automotive division recorded its lowest profitability in five years in Q4 2024, with a 13.6% gross margin. The company plans to launch its Robotaxi in June 2025. For Walmart, its e-commerce segment is approaching profitability, with a projected 3-4% overall revenue growth. The company also announced plans to invest $6 billion in Mexico in 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "45 days (from May 13, 2025 to June 27, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Given the short timeframe and the described deterioration in Tesla's position, the status quo likely favors Walmart maintaining or achieving a higher market cap than Tesla by June 27, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tesla's market cap exceeds Walmart's by June 27. This could occur if the Robotaxi launch in June generates significant investor enthusiasm, if Tesla announces better-than-expected Q2 results, or if there's a broader market rally that disproportionately benefits high-volatility growth stocks like Tesla",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Walmart maintains a higher market cap than Tesla through June 27. This occurs if Tesla's decline continues or stabilizes at current levels, if the Robotaxi launch fails to generate sustained investor enthusiasm, if Walmart's steady performance continues with its e-commerce profitability improving, or if Tesla faces additional negative news regarding its core automotive business",
    "rationale": "With only 45 days until resolution, the short timeframe heavily favors status quo persistence. Tesla faces significant headwinds: a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), automotive gross margins at five-year lows (13.6%), and JPMorgan analysts suggesting a historic decline. Walmart shows steady momentum with e-commerce approaching profitability and $6B planned investment in Mexico expansion. The key variable is Tesla's Robotaxi launch in June, which occurs just before the resolution date. However, product launches typically face execution risk, and even positive launches may not immediately reverse sustained market cap declines. The article framing suggests Tesla may have already declined significantly relative to Walmart. My forecast is not higher because Tesla remains a high-volatility stock capable of sharp rallies, especially around product announcements, and the Robotaxi launch could generate significant hype. My forecast is not lower because the fundamentals strongly favor Walmart's stability over Tesla's current turmoil, and 45 days is insufficient time for a complete Tesla reversal absent extraordinary catalysts. I would update higher (toward 75-80%) if Tesla announces disappointing pre-launch Robotaxi details or further earnings deterioration. I would update lower (toward 45-50%) if early Robotaxi reviews or pre-orders exceed expectations dramatically",
