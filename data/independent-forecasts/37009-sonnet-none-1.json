    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days (from April 21, 2025 to May 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Haley Stevens has not announced her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan as of April 21, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Stevens continues to weigh her options and either decides not to run for Senate, choosing to remain in her House seat, or delays any announcement beyond May 1, 2025 to allow more time for planning and fundraising",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the withdrawal of other top Democratic contenders like Whitmer and Buttigieg, party leadership intensifies pressure on Stevens to enter the race. She responds to this pressure and announces her candidacy within the next 10 days to fill the void in the Democratic field",
    "rationale": "With only 10 days remaining until the deadline, the status quo strongly favors a No outcome. The CNN article from April 10 indicates that multiple top Democratic contenders have already withdrawn from the race, which occurred 11 days ago. If Stevens were seriously considering running and wanted to capitalize on this opening, she likely would have announced by now to secure early support and begin fundraising. The fact that nearly two weeks have passed since other candidates dropped out without an announcement from Stevens suggests either hesitation or a decision not to run. Senate campaigns require extensive preparation, fundraising infrastructure, and strategic planning - launching a campaign with such short notice would be challenging even for an experienced politician. However, I'm not assigning an extremely low probability because political announcements can happen quickly when circumstances demand it, and party pressure on Stevens may have intensified recently given the lack of strong Democratic candidates. The probability is not higher because the status quo has held for at least 11 days post-dropout announcements, and time is running very short. The probability is not lower because political dynamics can shift rapidly, and a late entry is still possible if Stevens feels compelled to serve her party's interests.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Haley Stevens announce her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [Democrats lose another top contender for US Senate seat in Michigan after Whitmer and Buttigieg bow out](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/politics/michigan-senate-race-democrats-mcdonald-rivet/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Haley Stevens announces her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
