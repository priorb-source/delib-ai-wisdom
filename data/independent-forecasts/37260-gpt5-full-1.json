  "information": "The legal process to ban a political party in Germany requires an application to be submitted to the Federal Constitutional Court by the federal government, the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat. The court must then rule that the party aims to undermine the democratic order. Historically, only two parties have been banned in post-WWII Germany: the Socialist Reich Party (SRP) in 1952 and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1956. A 2017 attempt to ban the far-right NPD party failed. As of early May 2025, no formal application to ban the AfD had been filed with the Constitutional Court. Separately, Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV) has classified the AfD as a 'proven right-wing extremist organization,' which permits state surveillance.\n\nAccording to polling in late April 2025, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party had support from 25-26% of voters, making it one of the strongest parties in Germany. Internally, the AfD leadership delayed the release of its new foundational program from 2025 to 2027, with party insiders stating the reason was to avoid public debate on contentious issues and internal party conflict ahead of state elections in 2026. In the public sphere, demonstrations protesting the AfD and right-wing extremism were held across multiple German cities on May 1, 2025. Earlier, in February 2025, a rally in Hachenburg demanding a ban on the AfD drew approximately 1,200 participants.\n\nIn January 2025, a cross-party group of 124 lawmakers in the German Bundestag, led by CDU politician Marco Wanderwitz, submitted a motion to initiate a party ban procedure against the AfD at the Federal Constitutional Court. The Bundestag debated this motion, along with a related motion from the Green party to assess the chances of such a procedure's success, on January 30, 2025. While a group of 17 constitutional law experts issued a statement supporting the proposal and asserting the AfD is unconstitutional, reports from the time indicated that no immediate decisions were expected from the debate and that the motion lacked majority support.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the AfD is not banned by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No formal application to ban the AfD is filed with the Federal Constitutional Court by the Bundesregierung, Bundestag, or Bundesrat before July 1; or an application is filed but the Court does not issue a ruling by that date (the case remains pending).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden political consensus leads one of the authorized bodies to file for a party ban immediately, and the Federal Constitutional Court takes the case on an unprecedented emergency track and issues a final ban within weeks. This would require an extraordinary acceleration far beyond historical practice.",
    "rationale": "- Process and authority: Under Article 21(2) of Germany’s Basic Law, only the Federal Constitutional Court can ban a political party, and only after a formal application by the federal government, Bundestag, or Bundesrat. As of early May 2025, no such application has been filed for the AfD.\n- Timelines: Party-ban cases are complex and lengthy. The most recent NPD proceeding (2013 filing to 2017 decision) took years. Even if an application were filed immediately, a final ban before July 1, 2025 would be unprecedented.\n- Political feasibility: A January 2025 Bundestag debate considered motions related to initiating a ban procedure, but reporting indicated no majority support and no decision to proceed. Without majority backing in the Bundestag or a decision by the federal government or Bundesrat, no case can even start.\n- Current status: The BfV’s classification of the AfD as a “proven right-wing extremist organization” allows surveillance but is not a ban. Polling shows the AfD remains one of the strongest parties, which further reduces near-term political appetite for initiating a ban.\n- Baseline/status quo: Given no application, short remaining timeline (~60 days), and historical precedent, the default outcome is No.\nWhy not higher: The lack of a filed case and the Court’s historically long timelines make a ban by July 1 extraordinarily unlikely.\nWhy not lower: A tiny residual probability remains for unforeseen shocks (e.g., a major security incident linked to party leadership prompting immediate filing and an exceptional fast-track ruling). Even then, the timeline still makes this extremely improbable.\nWhat would change my view: (a) A confirmed application filed by an authorized body (would raise the probability slightly but still keep it well under 1% due to timing); (b) credible reporting of the Court adopting an emergency accelerated schedule; (c) a dramatic political or security development producing cross-party consensus and explicit government intent to fast-track the case.",
