    "review": "Both forecasters provided excellent and reinforcing analyses. We all agree on the central thesis: bureaucratic inertia makes a rapid takedown of a major federal website highly unlikely within a 7-week timeframe, especially given archival and procedural requirements. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the program's deep integration with private sector stakeholders (manufacturers, retailers) was a valuable addition, highlighting the logistical complexity beyond just internal government processes. This strengthens the case against an abrupt shutdown. The most compelling new argument came from Forecaster 2, who explicitly broke down the risks into two categories: intentional policy action (6-8%) and measurement/technical risk (2-3%). I had initially grouped these into a general 5% risk, but their granular approach is more rigorous. The concept of 'measurement risk' — the chance that the resolution source itself reports the site as down due to a transient error — is a crucial point I had not specifically isolated, and it applies regardless of the EPA's actions.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 95% to 92%. My initial reasoning was that the procedural hurdles for decommissioning a .gov domain were too high to overcome in less than two months. While I stand by that as the most likely scenario, the other forecasters convinced me that I had underestimated two key risks. First, as Forecaster 2 detailed, there is a non-trivial 'measurement risk' of 2-3% that a temporary technical glitch or an error from the resolution source (`IsItDownRightNow`) could cause a false negative on the resolution date. This risk is inherent to the question's design and independent of the political situation. Second, both forecasters persuaded me to assign a higher probability to the 'political will' risk — the chance that the administration takes unusually swift, symbolic action to circumvent normal processes and order the site taken down immediately. The directness of the quotes in the NYT article supports this possibility. Combining a ~2% measurement risk with a revised ~6% risk of an accelerated political takedown leads to a total 'No' probability of 8%. This brings my forecast down to 92%, which I believe more accurately reflects the combined bureaucratic, political, and technical uncertainties.",
