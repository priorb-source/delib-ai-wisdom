    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis closely aligns with mine, emphasizing status quo bias and the short timeframe. The 15% vs 13% difference is negligible. However, Forecaster 3 raises an important consideration I underweighted: the U.S.-Niger relationship strain and ongoing U.S. troop withdrawal. This is significant because deteriorating bilateral relations and reduced consular capacity have historically correlated with Level 4 upgrades, as seen in the South Sudan case. The U.S. has indeed been withdrawing military forces from Niger following the July 2023 coup, which could affect embassy operations and increase the likelihood of an ordered departure - a typical trigger for Level 4 advisories. This contextual factor deserves more weight than I initially gave it. That said, I find Forecaster 3's 23% slightly high given that these relationship issues have been ongoing for some time without triggering an advisory change, and the advisory hasn't been updated since March 2023 despite significant events. The bureaucratic inertia argument remains strong over a 2-month window.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating my assessment to incorporate the U.S.-Niger bilateral relationship tensions more fully. The ongoing military withdrawal and potential for reduced embassy operations represents a meaningful risk factor that could trigger a Level 4 advisory even without a dramatic security incident. However, several factors prevent me from moving significantly higher: (1) the relationship deterioration has been gradual and known for months without prompting an advisory change, (2) the advisory hasn't been updated since March 2023 despite the coup and subsequent events, suggesting bureaucratic stability, (3) the two-month timeframe remains extremely short for policy changes absent a clear catalyst, and (4) the current Level 3 + regional Level 4 structure may be viewed as adequate by the State Department. The base rate of advisory changes over 60-day periods is low, and while the tail risk is real given regional instability, the most likely outcome remains status quo. I'm adjusting upward from 13% to 17% to reflect the valid U.S.-Niger relationship concerns while maintaining that dramatic change within two months requires specific triggering events that haven't materialized.",
