  "information": "The recall was initiated by Johnsonville LLC on April 5, 2025, for approximately 22,672 pounds of its cheddar bratwurst product due to potential contamination with hard plastic. The affected products were produced on a single date, February 5, 2025, and bear the establishment number 'Est. 1647'. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) classified this as a Class I recall, indicating a high health risk. The recall was prompted by two consumer complaints, but no confirmed injuries have been reported. The product was distributed to retail locations in ten states: Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The FSIS has noted concerns that the product may still be in consumers' freezers.\n\nThe FSIS follows a structured process for closing recalls. This process involves verifying that the recalling firm has notified all its customers, confirming that the product has been removed from circulation, conducting effectiveness checks to ensure the product is no longer available to consumers, and verifying that the company has implemented corrective actions. For Class I recalls, which are deemed high-risk, the FSIS enforces more rigorous verification requirements before it can be closed. Recalls involving foreign material contamination necessitate a comprehensive investigation into the source of the contaminant and the implementation of effective preventive measures.\n\nHistorical data on similar FSIS recalls provides context for typical closure timelines. Many previous recalls handled by Johnsonville were closed within 4 to 8 weeks. Broader data for Class I meat recalls of a similar size often shows closure within 2 to 4 months after the announcement. However, some cases can take longer; a recall for Tyson Fun Nuggets in 2023 took approximately four months to close. A January 2025 report from the Plastic Pollution Coalition also mentioned that several recalls from 2024 involving plastic contamination remained ongoing for several months after their initiation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "52 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The recall is currently listed as 'Active' by the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS). If this status does not change, the outcome will be 'No'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall remains 'Active' on July 1, 2025. This could occur if the FSIS verification process is prolonged due to the high-risk Class I classification, complexities in tracing the source of the plastic contamination, or difficulties in confirming the product has been fully removed from consumers' homes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recall status is changed to 'Closed' before July 1, 2025. This would happen if Johnsonville efficiently completes its product recovery, implements and documents corrective actions to the FSIS's satisfaction, and the agency completes its effectiveness checks and formal closure process promptly.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on balancing Johnsonville's specific recall history against the general complexities of this type of recall. The recall was issued on April 5, 2025, leaving a total of nearly 12 weeks until the July 1 deadline. As of today (May 9), approximately 5 weeks have passed.\n\nThe primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the historical data provided for Johnsonville, which indicates typical recall closures within 4 to 8 weeks. This timeframe suggests the recall could be closed anytime between now and early June, well before the deadline. The recall is also limited to a single production date, which generally simplifies the process of tracking and accounting for the affected product.\n\nHowever, several factors introduce uncertainty and support a 'No' outcome. This is a Class I recall, which the FSIS subjects to more rigorous verification procedures, potentially extending the timeline. The contaminant is hard plastic, which necessitates a thorough investigation into the source and the implementation of robust preventive measures before closure. My research assistant noted that similar recalls involving plastic have sometimes taken several months to resolve. The concern that the product may be in consumers' freezers also complicates the 'effectiveness checks' required for closure.\n\nI am assigning a probability of 65% because Johnsonville’s specific company history is a strong predictor, and the timeline allows ample buffer even for minor delays. The 12-week window is within the typical 2-4 month closure period for broader Class I recalls. However, my forecast is not higher because the Class I status and the nature of the plastic contamination introduce a significant risk of delays that could push the closure beyond July 1. I would increase my forecast if FSIS or Johnsonville released information indicating the product recovery phase was complete. Conversely, I would decrease it if any new adverse events were reported or if there was an indication of complexity in the FSIS investigation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Johnsonville LLC of cheddar bratwurst for foreign matter contamination issued April 5, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReal Simple: [Over 22,000 Pounds of a Popular Sausage Brand Recalled Due to Contamination](https://www.realsimple.com/sausage-recall-2025-11711268)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
