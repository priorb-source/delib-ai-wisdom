    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (BLS May 2025 average prices are expected with the CPI release in mid-June 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — recent banana prices have generally been at or above $0.63/lb; being under $0.6300 would require a modest downward move from typical 2024–2025 levels.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Import and shipping costs remain firm and/or producers and retailers hold recent price increases, leaving the May average at $0.6300 or higher (remember: exactly $0.6300 would still be No).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Improved supply and logistics, a stronger dollar lowering import costs, and/or widespread retail promotions nudge the May average below $0.6300.",
    "rationale": "Baseline anchoring: The BLS average price series for bananas is historically stable and, in the last couple of years, has hovered in the low-to-mid $0.60s. Under $0.6300 is on the low side of that recent range, so the status quo points to No. Monthly volatility is typically small (on the order of fractions of a cent to a couple of cents), so getting below $0.6300 from a typical recent level would require a nontrivial downside move within a single month. The Quartz piece flags upward pressures (producer price hikes, port fees), which tilt risks toward prices holding firm or rising rather than dipping under the threshold. The outcome rule is strict: it must be under $0.6300; $0.6300 exactly resolves No, slightly reducing the probability of a Yes. Research assistant note: no additional info provided, so I’m leaning more on historical stability and recent macro context (food-at-home inflation modest, but not clearly disinflationary for bananas). Why not higher? There is some chance of a dip—bananas are often promoted, seasonality and supply improvements can shave a cent or two, and the USD could help. Why not lower? Evidence of upward cost pressures and the central tendency near/above $0.63 argue that a sub-$0.6300 print is less likely absent a clear catalyst. What would move me up: Seeing April 2025 BLS banana price at or below ~$0.632; reports of falling import/freight costs; notable retail promotions; a strengthening USD versus exporters’ currencies. What would move me down: April print ≥ ~$0.640; news of producer price hikes, shipping surcharges, disease/weather disruptions, or other supply constraints.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the price of bananas reported by the US BLS for May 2025 be under 63 cents a pound?\n\nQuestion background:\nQuartz: [Move over, eggs – bananas are the next victim](https://qz.com/bananas-dole-price-hikes-inflation-port-fees-trump-tari-1851772583)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the price reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics [here](https://data.bls.gov/toppicks?survey=ap) for Bananas, per lb. - APU0000711211, to the thousandths of a decimal point, is under $0.6300 for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-13.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
