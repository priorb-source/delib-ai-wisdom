    "review": "Both forecasters provide strong analyses that align closely with mine. Forecaster 2 makes a particularly compelling case for a lower probability (4%) by emphasizing that the tracker already marks the objective as 'in progress' despite the March 7 executive order, suggesting they require more substantial evidence of termination rather than mere eligibility restrictions. Forecaster 3 arrives at 10% with reasoning nearly identical to mine. The key insight from Forecaster 2 that I hadn't fully weighted is this: if Keep_Track maintainers haven't marked the objective 'complete' after the executive order was signed over two months ago, they likely have a higher bar for what constitutes 'termination' versus 'in progress.' This is strong evidence about their methodology. Additionally, all three of us converge on the impossibility of the procedural timeline - the rulemaking committee's first session literally overlaps with the resolution date, with proposed rules expected 'later in 2025.' The statutory requirement for Congressional action to truly terminate the program is another insurmountable barrier in this timeframe.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, Forecaster 2's argument about the tracker maintainers' demonstrated behavior is persuasive. They've had the March 7 executive order in hand for over two months and still mark it 'in progress' rather than 'complete.' This suggests they distinguish between limiting eligibility and terminating the program. The procedural timeline is even more constraining than I initially weighted - the negotiated rulemaking process hasn't even begun with its first session scheduled at the deadline itself. However, I'm maintaining slightly higher probability than Forecaster 2's 4% because: (1) some residual uncertainty about tracker interpretation remains, (2) there's a non-zero possibility of dramatic unexpected developments, and (3) we lack perfect information about Keep_Track's exact criteria for marking objectives complete. The evidence strongly suggests status quo persistence, but absolute certainty isn't warranted given these remaining uncertainties.",
