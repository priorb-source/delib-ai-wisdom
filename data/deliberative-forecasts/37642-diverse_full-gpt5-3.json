    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core pillars I relied on: only one regular decision point (June FOMC) before the deadline, rare intermeeting action absent acute stress, explicit Fed patience, and market/institutional consensus pushing cuts to July or later. They also highlight CME FedWatch pricing for June as very low and reiterate the need for multiple soft prints and/or labor-market deterioration to justify a June move. I find their reasoning sound and consistent with base rates. They did not introduce materially new bullish arguments for a June cut; if anything, their emphasis on market pricing and institutional consensus marginally reinforces a lower probability than my prior. I agree with their trigger conditions (e.g., notably soft CPI and payrolls, rising unemployment, or financial stress).",
    "rationale": "The only realistic path to “Yes” is a June 18 FOMC cut (or a rare emergency cut). Fed communication remains cautious (“not in a hurry”), and the March SEP lifted the 2025 inflation outlook to 2.7%, reducing urgency. The data calendar gives the Fed April PCE (May 31), the June 7 jobs report, and May CPI (June 12) before the meeting—enough to nudge guidance, but probably not enough to establish the sustained disinflation and labor softening they have asked to see. Market pricing implies a low single- to low double-digit chance for June, and major banks have shifted to July or later. A June cut requires a run of downside surprises and/or emerging stress; possible, but not my base case. Given the other forecasters’ arguments and market signals, I’m nudging my estimate slightly down from 12% to 11%.",
