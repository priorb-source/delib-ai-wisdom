    "review": "The analyses from the other two forecasters are highly aligned with my own. We have all reached a strong consensus based on the same core reasoning: the extremely short timeframe of approximately two weeks until the resolution date. Both forecasters correctly identified the immense logistical, security, and diplomatic preparations required for such a high-level visit, which are impossible to complete on such short notice. They also concur that the only plausible, though highly improbable, path to a 'Yes' outcome would be a 'black swan' event, such as a severe international crisis demanding an emergency summit. Their arguments are convincing and reinforce my initial assessment. No new evidence or alternative scenarios were presented that would challenge the initial forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from my fellow forecasters, my reasoning remains unchanged. The deliberation process has confirmed and strengthened my initial conclusion. The primary, and overwhelming, factor is the time constraint. With only 16 days remaining until July 1, 2025, the window for arranging a state-level visit for a figure like Donald Trump to China is effectively closed. Such visits require weeks, if not months, of advance work by diplomatic and security teams. The current status quo is a complete absence of any public reporting, official chatter, or even rumors suggesting such a visit is being contemplated. The consensus among all forecasters that only an unprecedented global crisis could trigger such an event, and the lack of any such crisis, solidifies the view that the probability is extremely low. Therefore, I see no reason to adjust my initial forecast.",
