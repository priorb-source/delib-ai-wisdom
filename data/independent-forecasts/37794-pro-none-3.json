    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "13 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The league's top hitters perform exceptionally well but ultimately regress toward their career norms. Any player flirting with .400 in April or early May goes through a minor slump, causing their average to dip into the .370-.380 range by June 1, which is still elite but below the required threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A player, likely a high-contact hitter or a power hitter on an exceptional hot streak, maintains a torrid pace through the first two months of the season. Aided by some batted-ball luck (a high BABIP), the player avoids any prolonged slumps and enters June 1 with a batting average of .400 or higher.",
    "rationale": "Forecasting this outcome requires balancing the immense historical difficulty of hitting .400 against recent precedent. The status quo outcome is 'No' because in most seasons, no player reaches June 1 with a .400 average. The modern era of baseball, characterized by high-velocity pitching, defensive analytics, and specialized relievers, structurally suppresses batting averages, making the feat much harder than in the past.\n\nHowever, a 'Yes' outcome is very plausible. As recently as 2023, Luis Arráez carried a batting average over .400 into June. This demonstrates that despite the modern challenges, an exceptionally skilled hitter on a hot streak can achieve this benchmark two months into the season. The question is not about maintaining the average for a full season (a near-impossibility) but simply reaching this specific date.\n\nMy forecast of 25% is not higher because the Arráez event from 2023 is more of an exception than a rule. It remains a statistically rare event, and regression to the mean is a powerful force that pulls even the hottest hitters back to Earth. For every season a player accomplishes this, there are several seasons where no one does.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the 2023 precedent provides a strong 'proof of concept' in the current baseball environment. It is not a hypothetical feat but something that has been recently accomplished. Acknowledging that this can and does happen prevents a forecast in the single digits.\n\nTo update this forecast, I would need to see the current MLB leaderboards for this hypothetical May 19, 2025. If a qualified hitter is currently batting over .410, I would significantly increase my probability. Conversely, if the league leader is batting .365 or lower, I would drastically reduce it, as closing that gap in just 13 days is extremely unlikely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if on June 1, 2025, any Major League Baseball player in the 2025 regular season has a batting average of greater than or equal to .400 according to the [ESPN baseball stats page](https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
