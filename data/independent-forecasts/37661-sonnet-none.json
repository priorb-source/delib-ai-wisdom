    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (from May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Bangladesh is not currently listed as available on Starlink's website, and this would remain the case if no changes occur",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite receiving final approval from Bangladeshi leadership, Starlink encounters delays in establishing the necessary ground infrastructure, gateway stations, regulatory compliance procedures, payment systems, and operational partnerships. The 6-week timeframe proves too short to complete all requirements for listing Bangladesh as 'Available' on their map.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the leader's final approval, Starlink rapidly deploys pre-positioned resources and completes infrastructure setup that may have been underway during the approval process. They prioritize Bangladesh for a quick rollout, complete regulatory requirements, and update their availability map to show Bangladesh as 'Available' within the 6-week window.",
    "rationale": "The background article indicates that Bangladesh's leader has given 'final approval' to Starlink service, which is a significant positive development. However, the critical constraint is the extremely tight timeline of only 6 weeks until the July 1, 2025 deadline. Historically, Starlink's market launches involve multiple steps: establishing ground gateway stations, securing spectrum rights, setting up payment and customer service infrastructure, obtaining equipment import permits, and completing operational testing. Even in expedited cases, this process typically takes several months from approval to being listed as 'Available' on their map. The status quo outcome (No) deserves substantial weight because the world changes slowly - regulatory approvals rarely translate to immediate operational availability. The fact that we only have 6 weeks makes this particularly challenging. That said, there are scenarios where this could happen: Starlink may have been preparing infrastructure in anticipation of approval, they have demonstrated rapid deployment capability in some markets, and the leadership approval could accelerate remaining bureaucratic processes. My forecast is not higher because 6 weeks is genuinely very tight for a full market launch, and there's no evidence from the research assistant that infrastructure is already in place or that Starlink has publicly announced imminent availability. My forecast is not lower because the approval is real and Starlink has shown operational agility in the past. I would update higher if I learned that ground stations were already installed or that Starlink had announced a specific launch date before July 1. I would update lower if I learned about additional regulatory hurdles or delays in infrastructure deployment.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Bangladesh as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Bangladeshi leader gives final approval to Musk's Starlink service](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/bangladeshi-leader-gives-final-approval-to-musks-starlink-service/3551404)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Bangladesh listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
