  "information": "In early March 2025, during the inauguration of President Yamandú Orsi in Montevideo, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva publicly invited Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico to the BRICS summit scheduled for July in Rio de Janeiro. Lula stated, 'it's essential that these countries participate, because it's a moment for debate with the whole world.' Following the invitation, President Orsi expressed interest in participating, stating he hoped other Latin American countries would join to 'consolidate multilateralism and free trade.'\n\nPresident Yamandú Orsi is confirmed to travel to Seville, Spain, to attend the Fourth International Conference on Sustainable Development Financing. This United Nations conference is scheduled to run from June 30 to July 3, 2025. President Orsi has reaffirmed Uruguay's commitment to multilateralism, stating that his government will be in Seville to 'strengthen and commit' to the UN's objectives.\n\nAs of early June 2025, the government of Uruguay had not issued an official public statement confirming or denying President Orsi's attendance at the BRICS summit. Media coverage at the time described the country's participation as 'undecided' or 'up in the air.' The BRICS summit is scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro on July 6-7, 2025. Other leaders, including India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are planning to attend.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Uruguayan government either formally declines the invitation, likely citing a scheduling conflict, or simply allows the July 1 deadline to pass without making any announcement confirming President Orsi's attendance.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before the July 1 deadline, the Uruguayan government or a representative issues a public communication, such as a press release or a statement during a press conference, confirming President Orsi will attend the BRICS summit in person.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the significant logistical challenge and the current lack of official communication. The key piece of evidence is President Orsi's confirmed attendance at the UN conference in Seville, Spain, which runs until July 3, 2025. The BRICS summit begins in Rio de Janeiro on July 6. This creates a very tight travel schedule for a head of state, involving transatlantic travel and immediate participation in another major summit, making attendance difficult to manage. The status quo is that no announcement has been made, and with less than a month remaining, this silence is a strong indicator that attendance is not a priority or has been deemed unfeasible. While President Orsi initially expressed interest in March, which a positive signal, this was before the logistical complexities were likely finalized. The political goodwill Cained by accepting the invitation from Brazil's President Lula does not seem to outweigh the practical constraints. My forecast is not lower than 25% because the political motivation to attend is real; Uruguay values multilateralism, and the BRICS platform is significant. A last-minute decision to make the difficult journey work is not impossible. My forecast is not higher because the confirmed conference in Spain is a concrete, hard constraint that makes attendance highly improbable. I would increase my forecast if any official sources indicate they are actively working to resolve the scheduling conflict. I would decrease it if officials begin to publicly emphasize the importance of the Spain conference.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn early March 2025, during the inauguration of President Yamandú Orsi in Montevideo, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva publicly invited Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico to the BRICS summit scheduled for July in Rio de Janeiro.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
