    "review": "My initial forecast of 75% was likely too high, primarily because it underestimated two key factors raised by the other forecasters. First, Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 presented different, but plausible, base rates for recall closure times (4-6 months vs. 1-4 months). This highlights significant uncertainty in how long a 'typical' recall takes, making the 95-day window for this forecast less of a sure thing than I initially assumed. Second, and more importantly, Forecaster 3's point about administrative lag is crucial. The resolution criteria hinge specifically on the status of a government webpage, which may not be updated in real-time even if Cargill completes all necessary actions. This introduces a source of delay that is independent of the company's efficiency and which I had not sufficiently weighted in my initial analysis. While I find Forecaster 2's reasoning that 40 days of 'Active' status is a strong negative signal less convincing (it seems like a normal duration at this stage), their overall caution combined with Forecaster 3's specific mechanism for delay (website lag) are compelling.",
    "rationale": "I am revising my forecast downward from 75% to 60%. My initial analysis correctly identified the key variables—a competent company (Cargill), a manageable recall type (chemical contaminant), and a reasonable timeframe (~3 months). However, the deliberation with my peers has convinced me that I was overconfident. \n\nThe primary reason for my revision is the argument regarding administrative lag, as raised by Forecaster 3. The resolution of this question depends solely on the status of the FSIS webpage, not the operational reality of the recall. Government website updates can lag behind on-the-ground completion by days or even weeks. This factor alone significantly lowers the probability of a 'Yes' resolution before the July 1 deadline, even if Cargill is efficient. \n\nFurthermore, the conflicting base rates for recall closure times cited by the other forecasters (1-4 months vs. 4-6 months) introduce more uncertainty than I had initially factored in. The 95-day window from issuance to the deadline is clearly within a range where closure is plausible but far from certain. My initial assessment that this was an 'ample' amount of time was too strong. My updated forecast of 60% still favors a 'Yes' outcome, reflecting the belief that Cargill is incentivized to act quickly and that three months is a very common timeframe for closure. However, the 15-point reduction from my original 75% now properly accounts for the significant risks of bureaucratic/website update delays and the general uncertainty surrounding recall closure timelines.",
