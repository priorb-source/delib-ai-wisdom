    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 introduce two potentially material claims I did not incorporate: (1) unusually specific Iranian signaling (via Shamkhani) pointing to a concrete framework, and (2) multiple completed negotiation rounds with convergence language, plus an Israeli assessment of a “high chance.” If true, those imply talks are well past exploratory. That said, none of these are corroborated in the brief I have, and Israeli leaks can be instrumentalized for signaling. Forecaster 2’s reliance on Israeli intelligence as a strong affirmative indicator feels over-weighted absent parallel signs (IAEA choreography, sanctions waivers, synchronized statements). Forecaster 3’s process evidence (rounds, convergence) is directionally plausible but still runs into the same structural gaps: the US red lines (no sunset, removal of enriched uranium, dismantling centrifuges) versus what Tehran will accept, and the political cost of publicly labeling any outcome a “deal.” Both peers’ 40% seems too high given the 6–7 week runway, domestic veto points, and the tendency to use informal understandings to avoid INARA/optics. Still, I give some weight to the possibility of a narrowly framed, publicly acknowledged interim understanding (freeze-for-freeze with verification) that technically qualifies for resolution criteria.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~47 days. The default remains No; complex nuclear agreements rarely get publicly announced on this timetable unless they’re very limited.\n- Structural constraints: The reported US “red lines” and recent sanctions designations reduce overlap with Iran’s bottom lines. Publicly announcing an agreement invites domestic scrutiny (potential INARA implications), which incentivizes informal, quiet understandings rather than a labeled “deal.”\n- What could still clear the bar: The resolution only needs a signed or announced agreement “with respect to Iran’s nuclear program,” not a full JCPOA 2.0. A narrow, time-bound, reversible, and verification-light understanding—e.g., halting 60% enrichment and shipping or diluting a subset of stockpile in exchange for limited sanctions relief/waivers—could be publicly described as an “understanding” or “arrangement,” satisfying resolution criteria if both sides acknowledge it.\n- Weighing peer inputs: I treat the Israeli ‘high chance’ leak and alleged multi-round convergence as modestly positive, but unverified. In past cycles, similar signals often preceded either slippage into tacit, unannounced arrangements or breakdowns under political pressure. Given that, I update upward slightly from my prior but stay well below 30%.\n- Up-move triggers: IAEA DG travel yielding a joint communiqué; US issuing notable sanctions waivers/general licenses tied to nuclear steps; Iran publicly pausing 60% enrichment; coordinated readouts referencing a framework text. Down-move triggers: IAEA censure; fresh nuclear-linked sanctions; Iranian escalation or categorical public denials of interim arrangements.",
