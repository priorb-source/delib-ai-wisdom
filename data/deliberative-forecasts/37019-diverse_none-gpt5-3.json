    "review": "Both forecasters lean on the same core pillars I used: multiple nominations, Stapleton’s strong ACM track record, and the math of “at least one win.” Forecaster 2 adds a concrete historical win count (17) which, while I haven’t independently verified here, is directionally consistent with his reputation and supports the notion of entrenched voter support. Forecaster 3 clearly quantifies the multi-shot advantage with per-category win rates in the 25–30% range, which aligns with my framing. Neither analysis introduced compelling counter-evidence (e.g., category-specific juggernauts or indications of an industry “spread the love” year), but both reasonably argue the base rate should be high. My only caution remains category correlation—if voters tilt away from Stapleton this cycle, the independence math overstates his chance. Still, their arguments modestly reinforce that my initial estimate may have been a bit conservative.",
    "rationale": "Five nominations materially reduce the risk of a shutout. If his average per-category win chance is roughly 0.27–0.30, independence math implies ~79–83% for at least one win; allowing for correlated outcomes trims that slightly but likely still lands in the low 80s given his ACM reputation and historical conversion. The absence of category-specific intel or strong competitor momentum keeps me from going higher, but peers’ emphasis on his deep ACM track record nudges me up a bit. I’m updating from 79% to 82%, reflecting modestly stronger confidence in a yes without assuming independence or ignoring strong competition from contemporaries (e.g., Lainey Wilson, Luke Combs, Morgan Wallen).",
