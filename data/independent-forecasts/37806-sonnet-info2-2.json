  "information": "Since taking office in January 2025, the Trump administration has taken numerous actions on immigration. As of February 17, 2025, the administration had issued 62 executive orders, including ones to end Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates, an order to end birthright citizenship for children of unauthorized immigrants, and a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border. Other relevant policies implemented include a new rule requiring non-citizens to carry proof of legal status at all times, visa restrictions on Indian travel agencies accused of facilitating illegal immigration, and a policy to limit visas for foreign officials who facilitate irregular migration.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 42 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no presidential action mentioning 'Diversity Visa' has been issued as of May 20, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues focusing on other immigration priorities like border enforcement, deportations, and asylum restrictions without issuing a specific presidential action about the Diversity Visa program. Any changes to the program might occur through other means like legislation or regulatory adjustments, or the program might simply not be addressed before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump issues an executive order, proclamation, or memorandum specifically addressing the Diversity Visa lottery program - potentially suspending, restricting, or attempting to eliminate it - and this action is published on the White House website with the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The Trump administration has been extremely active on immigration, issuing 62 executive orders by mid-February 2025, covering major areas like DEI mandates, birthright citizenship, border emergencies, and visa restrictions. Trump has historically opposed the Diversity Visa lottery program, and conservative outlets have advocated for its cancellation. However, we are now approximately 4 months into his presidency (late January to late May), and no specific presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa has been issued yet according to the research assistant's report. This is significant because if it were a high priority, one would expect action to have been taken during the initial flurry of immigration-related executive orders. The Diversity Visa program affects a relatively small number of people (50,000 visas annually) compared to Trump's focus on broader issues like border security, mass deportations, and asylum restrictions. The program may be affected indirectly by other immigration actions, or changes might be pursued through legislation rather than executive action. That said, 42 days remains meaningful time, and Trump could still issue such an action. The velocity of executive actions has been high, and the ideological opposition to diversity-based immigration programs is clear. My forecast is not higher because: (1) four months have passed without action on this specific program despite intense immigration activity, (2) it appears to be lower priority than border/deportation issues, (3) the program is relatively small-scale. My forecast is not lower because: (1) there's still 6 weeks remaining, (2) Trump's demonstrated opposition to the program, (3) the administration's high velocity of executive actions. I would update higher if: reports emerge of White House drafting such an action, or if Trump makes public statements about targeting the Diversity Visa specifically. I would update lower if: we reach mid-June without any indication of such action being prepared.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSince taking office in January 2025, the Trump administration has taken numerous actions on immigration.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
