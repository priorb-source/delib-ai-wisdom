    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The sanctions on NORD STREAM 2 AG are currently in place and will remain so if no policy change occurs.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The internal White House debate concludes that lifting sanctions would be a premature concession to Russia, sending the wrong signal to allies and undermining the international effort to support Ukraine. The geopolitical situation remains largely unchanged, and NORD STREAM 2 AG is still listed on the OFAC SDN list on July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A swift and unexpected de-escalation in the Ukraine conflict, possibly through a back-channel agreement, leads the US to lift sanctions on NORD STREAM 2 AG as a key part of the deal. This is done in coordination with European allies, primarily Germany, as a gesture to facilitate a broader peace settlement. NORD STREAM 2 AG is delisted by OFAC before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "The current US policy is to maintain strong sanctions against Russia due to the ongoing war in Ukraine. This represents a powerful status quo. Reversing this policy on a high-profile entity like NORD STREAM 2 AG would require a significant geopolitical shift or a compelling strategic reason. The provided Politico article indicates that this is being debated within the White House, which means a change is not impossible. However, the timeframe of less than two months is extremely short for such a major foreign policy change, which would face substantial political opposition both domestically and from key allies. The pipeline is also physically inoperable, reducing the immediate practical incentive to lift the sanctions. The high political cost and policy inertia strongly favor a 'No' outcome. My forecast is not lower because the existence of a high-level debate signals that there are pressures or potential scenarios, perhaps unknown to the public, that could lead to this outcome. I would increase my forecast upon credible news of a ceasefire or a major diplomatic breakthrough regarding Ukraine. I would decrease it upon news of a major Russian escalation or strong public statements from US officials ruling out any sanctions relief.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
