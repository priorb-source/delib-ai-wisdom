    "review": "The other forecasters have reached virtually identical conclusions (both at 15% vs my 18%), with compelling additional arguments. Forecaster 3's calculation that the power outage affected roughly 0.2% of monthly flights (5.7% of one day) is particularly useful for quantifying the maximum direct impact. Both forecasters emphasized the 'mechanical' nature of the Easter calendar effect - this is an important framing because unlike soft trends that can reverse, the Easter timing shift is a hard calendar fact that should almost certainly boost April 2025 numbers. Forecaster 2's point about US tourists not being the primary Canary Islands market (UK, Germany, and mainland Spain dominate) effectively dismisses the Trump policy concerns mentioned in the background. All three analyses converge on the same fundamental logic: multiple strong structural growth factors (capacity increases of 7-10%, consistent Q1 growth, favorable Easter timing) versus one limited disruption (single-day power outage affecting <1% of monthly traffic). For April 2025 to decline would require the power outage to have eliminated the equivalent of months of structural growth advantages, which seems highly implausible.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I believe my initial 18% forecast was slightly too cautious. The convergence at 15% appears well-justified. The Easter calendar effect alone - with the entire holiday falling in April 2025 versus late March 2024 - should provide several percentage points of growth, independent of other factors. Combined with 7-10% capacity increases (indicating strong advance bookings) and consistent Q1 2025 growth, the baseline expectation for growth is very strong. The April 28 power outage, while concerning, occurred too late in the month (affecting at most 2-3 days out of 30) to overcome these structural advantages. Even assuming worst-case cascading effects, this would impact perhaps 1-2% of monthly traffic - insufficient to reverse a month of positive momentum. I'm updating down to 16% (lower probability of decline) to align more closely with the consensus while maintaining some independent caution for potential unreported disruptions or measurement uncertainties.",
