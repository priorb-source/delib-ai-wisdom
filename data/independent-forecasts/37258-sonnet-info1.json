  "information": "A 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling established that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a legally binding independence referendum without the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster. The UK government has consistently denied requests for another referendum, a position reiterated by the UK Labour party. The previous independence referendum in 2014 was announced approximately two years before it was held, and precedent suggests constitutional changes require around 18 months of legal and administrative lead time.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 60 days (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement is made. The Scottish government continues to face UK government opposition and does not officially schedule an independence referendum.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish government does not announce a referendum date due to continued UK government opposition, the practical impossibility of organizing a referendum in such a short timeframe, and the lack of any political momentum or preparation for such an announcement. The status quo continues with no referendum date scheduled.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish First Minister or Parliament announces a date for a consultative (non-binding) independence referendum, perhaps as a political statement or to build momentum for future negotiations, despite knowing it lacks Westminster approval. This could occur as a response to polling showing strong independence support or as a strategic political move.",
    "rationale": "This question has a very low probability of resolving as Yes. Several factors strongly favor the status quo (No outcome): First, only 60 days remain until the deadline—an extremely short window. Second, there are no visible signals, preparations, or political momentum suggesting an imminent announcement. Third, my research assistant notes that the 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling prevents Scotland from unilaterally holding a legally binding referendum, and both the Conservative and Labour UK governments oppose granting permission. Fourth, historical precedent suggests constitutional referendums require 18-24 months of lead time for proper organization. The critical nuance is that the question specifies broader UK legality is irrelevant—only that 'a person or entity with authority to do so within Scotland' makes the announcement. This means the Scottish government could theoretically announce a consultative referendum date even without Westminster approval. However, even a consultative referendum would typically require months of preparation, legislative groundwork, and public signaling, none of which are evident. The recent polling showing strong independence support (55-44%) could motivate action, but this alone is insufficient to overcome the practical and political barriers within 60 days. My forecast is not higher because there are absolutely no signals of preparation, the timeframe is prohibitively short, and even symbolic announcements typically have some build-up. It's not lower because there remains a small possibility of a surprise political announcement for a consultative referendum, and 60 days does provide some room for unexpected political developments. To update higher, I would need to see: concrete signals of preparation, statements from Scottish government officials about imminent announcements, or a dramatic political shift. To update lower (closer to 0%), time would simply need to pass without any developments.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling established that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a legally binding independence referendum without the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster. The UK government has consistently denied requests for another referendum, a position reiterated by the UK Labour party. The previous independence referendum in 2014 was announced approximately two years before it was held, and precedent suggests constitutional changes require around 18 months of legal and administrative lead time.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
