    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core blockers I identified: (1) El Salvador’s physical custody plus Bukele’s categorical refusal; (2) the U.S. executive’s open resistance despite a unanimous Supreme Court ruling; and (3) the very short timeline after a missed April 7 deadline. I find Forecaster 2’s reasoning closely aligned with mine and well-calibrated. Forecaster 3’s higher (10%) estimate outlines plausible catalysts (judicial escalation, diplomatic movement) but doesn’t add concrete indicators that such shifts are underway; given the dual-executive resistance and foreign custody, 10% feels high absent new signals. Useful emphasis from both is the political difficulty of both leaders reversing public stances in weeks and the laggy nature of contempt/enforcement—points that reinforce a low base rate. A counter-consideration worth retaining is a tail path where Bukele reframes an expulsion to the U.S. as offloading a “terrorist,” or where escalating U.S. court pressure spurs some executive action; those tails keep the probability above de minimis.",
    "rationale": "Key facts: Garcia remains in Salvadoran maximum-security custody; Bukele has publicly vowed not to return him; the U.S. administration is resisting despite a unanimous Supreme Court order to “facilitate” return; a district judge is monitoring but the April 7 deadline was missed. “Facilitate” does not equate to guaranteeing a foreign sovereign’s cooperation, so even robust U.S. compliance steps wouldn’t ensure a Yes. The embassy reportedly lacks instructions, suggesting low executive will. With under two months left, typical timelines for contempt, sanctions, and effective diplomacy are tight. Yes-paths exist but are tail scenarios: (a) Bukele decides to expel Garcia to the U.S. to shift responsibility or as part of a face-saving bargain; (b) U.S. court pressure escalates enough to trigger real State/DHS engagement and a quick deal; (c) a political calculation shift in either capital leads to rapid movement. No-path remains the status quo: continued Salvadoran detention and U.S. slow-walking, possibly bolstered by new Salvadoran legal actions. Weighing the arguments, I slightly nudge up from 4% to 5% to reflect the nontrivial tail where Bukele opts to expel or a late-breaking diplomatic fix materializes, but the dominant scenario remains No.",
