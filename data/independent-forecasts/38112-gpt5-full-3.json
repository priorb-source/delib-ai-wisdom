  "information": "The 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled for July 6-7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro. As the host nation, Brazil's presidential adviser Celso Amorim stated in a May 11, 2025 interview that BRICS_ 'should stabilise where it is' before admitting more members. Official draft agendas for the summit, circulated in late April 2025, prioritize financial-architecture reforms and Global South development funds, containing only non-committal language regarding further enlargement. Brazil has invited Mexico, Uruguay, and Colombia to attend the summit as non-members.\n\nAt the 16th BRICS Summit, a 'partner country' framework was introduced. Of the initial invitees, Indonesia has since become a full member. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed their participation in the partner framework. On May 30, 2025, Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev publicly ruled out seeking full membership, stating that his country would maintain its observer status. He cited the organization's lack of permanent structures and a formal charter as reasons for this decision.\n\nThe admission of new full members to BRICS requires the unanimous consent of all existing members. An indication of the current internal climate came at the April 2025 foreign ministers’ meeting, where the bloc failed to reach an agreement on a joint communiqué. Ahead of the July summit, the 11th BRICS Parliamentary Forum is scheduled for June 3-5 in Brasília to discuss topics including sustainable development, climate action, and multilateral governance.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until 00:00 July 8, 2025, Rio time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new full-member invitation is issued.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BRICS leaders in Rio focus on financial architecture and development initiatives; communiqués mention the partner-country track but punt on full-member enlargement, citing the need to consolidate after Indonesia’s admission. The summit closes without any new full membership invitations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In late June or during the summit, members reach unanimous agreement to upgrade at least one partner (e.g., Nigeria, Malaysia, Thailand, or Turkey) to full membership, or to invite a non-partner with consensus. An official invitation is announced in the leaders’ declaration or a separate communiqué before the summit cutoff.",
    "rationale": "Timing: With roughly five weeks to go, any invitation requires pre-summit consensus and coordinated announcement. Unanimity is necessary, which historically slows decisions. Status quo: The host (Brazil) is signaling caution; Brazil’s top adviser said BRICS should stabilize before adding more members, and the draft agenda reportedly de-emphasizes enlargement. That makes “no new invitation” the default. Frictions: The April 2025 foreign ministers’ meeting failed to produce a joint communiqué, indicating internal divergences that would also complicate agreement on expansion. Candidate readiness: Of the 16th-summit partners, some haven’t even confirmed participation (Algeria, Turkey, Vietnam), and Kazakhstan publicly ruled out full membership. That shrinks the near-term pool of willing/ready candidates. Optics and balance: Inviting heavily sanctioned or highly polarizing states (e.g., Belarus, Cuba) would be politically costly for Brazil as host and could face resistance from India and others. More neutral, systemically important candidates (e.g., Nigeria, Malaysia, Thailand) would be easier, but there’s limited public evidence of imminent consensus. Recent expansion: Indonesia’s January 2025 accession shows expansion remains possible, but it also reduces immediate pressure to expand again at the very next summit. Signals that could move this forecast up: credible reporting that leaders have converged on admission criteria and a shortlist; explicit pre-briefings by sherpas or foreign ministers hinting that one or more partners (e.g., Nigeria or Malaysia) are set for elevation; Brazil softening its ‘stabilise’ stance; or leaks of draft declarations with named invitees. Signals that would push it down: reaffirmations from Brazil and India against near-term expansion; further public disagreements among members; partners expressing reluctance; or a finalized summit draft with no enlargement language. Why not higher: The host’s caution, need for unanimity, recent inability to agree on a foreign ministers’ communiqué, and lack of clear candidate momentum all point to no move this summit. Why not lower: BRICS has an active expansion track, just added Indonesia, and could still land on a single consensus candidate to signal continued growth, especially if China/Russia push and Brazil accepts a carefully chosen addition.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a new country be invited to BRICS at the 17th BRICS Summit?\n\nQuestion background:\n[BRICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS) is an intergovernmental organization originally founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which held their first formal summit in 2009. South Africa was invited to join in 2010, completing the original five-member grouping. BRICS serves as a forum for cooperation among major emerging economies, with a focus on economic development, political coordination, and reform of international institutions.\n\nAt the [15th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_BRICS_summit) in August 2023, the group announced a major expansion. Full membership invitations were extended to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Argentina later declined the invitation, while Saudi Arabia has not formally accepted. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE officially joined on January 1, 2024.&#x20;\n\nAt the [16th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_BRICS_summit) in October 2024, held in Kazan, Russia, BRICS formally introduced a new partner country framework. Thirteen countries were invited as partners at the 16th Summit: Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed participation. Indonesia later joined as a full member on January 6, 2025.\n\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled to take place on July 6–7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many countries have formally expressed interest in joining BRICS, but new members can only be admitted with unanimous agreement from existing members. While expansion remains a stated goal of the bloc, no new invitations have been confirmed.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if at least one previously not invited country is invited to join BRICS as a full member during or before the 17th BRICS summit.\n\nThis question will only resolve based upon an invitation for full membership, not partner status or any other status in the organisation.\n\n* An invitation of a partner country to become a full member will resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* Reinvitation of Saudi Arabia or Argentina will not be sufficient to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Whether or not a country accepts its invitation will have no impact on this question.\n* If the 17th BRICS summit is delayed, that will not impact this question unless the delay is to after August 31, 2025, in which case this question will be annulled.\n* The specific cutoff for resolution will be 00:00 following the final day of the summit. For example, if the summit is held as expected on July 6-7, the cutoff will be July 8, 00:00. This question will use the timezone of the summit's location, if the summit has no physical location, it will use UTC.\n* For the purposes of this question, \"country\" is defined as a UN member state.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled for July 6-7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
