    "review": "Forecaster 3 introduces critical new evidence I hadn't considered: a base rate of ~20% for similar ECOWAS security-related closures reopening within 60 days. This empirical data is valuable, though our window is only 31 days (half that timeframe). Forecaster 3 also makes an excellent point about the geographically limited nature of this closure (specific Kwara crossings, not all Nigeria-Benin borders), which could facilitate faster resolution. The mixed motives analysis (security plus commercial concerns) is compelling - purely security-driven closures may be stickier than those with commercial components where compromise is easier. Forecaster 2's analysis closely parallels my own reasoning, reinforcing the challenge of the tight timeframe and serious security concerns. However, I may have been too pessimistic by not considering that more targeted, limited closures might resolve faster than full border shutdowns. The historical precedent of Nigeria's 16-month closure with Benin in 2019-2020 cited by Forecaster 3 is sobering, but that was indeed broader in scope. The May 30 AFRICOM briefing about deteriorating security remains deeply concerning and wasn't adequately addressed by either forecaster - this suggests the underlying problems are worsening, not improving.",
    "rationale": "The base rate evidence from Forecaster 3 provides an important empirical anchor I initially lacked. If 20% of similar closures reopen within 60 days, the probability for 31 days would be lower but still meaningful - perhaps in the 12-15% range if we assume roughly linear distribution. However, the limited geographic scope (just Kwara crossings rather than all borders) and mixed motives (commercial plus security) are mitigating factors that could accelerate resolution compared to broader, purely security-driven closures. These factors might add 5-7 percentage points to the base rate-adjusted probability. Against this, the May 30 AFRICOM briefing indicating deteriorating security is a significant negative signal that neither other forecaster adequately weighted. This suggests the situation is moving in the wrong direction. The complete absence of diplomatic progress signals through late May, despite the Nigerian House resolution, also supports maintaining a relatively low forecast. Balancing the new evidence - the empirical base rate, limited scope, and mixed motives - against the deteriorating security environment and lack of progress signals, I believe a modest upward revision from my initial 18% is warranted, but not to Forecaster 3's 25% level given we have only half the time window of the base rate and security is worsening.",
