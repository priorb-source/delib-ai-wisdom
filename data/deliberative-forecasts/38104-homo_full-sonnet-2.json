    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly in the 60-65% range, suggesting strong convergence on the key factors. Forecaster 3 raises the most important new consideration: explicitly framing this as a compound probability problem where BOTH fugitives must be captured. Their mathematical approach (estimating individual probabilities at 65-70% for Massey and 70-75% for Groves, yielding joint probability of 45-52% if independent) is valuable and suggests my initial forecast may be slightly optimistic. However, I think the independence assumption is imperfect - capturing one fugitive often provides intelligence and allows resource concentration on the remaining one, creating positive correlation. Forecaster 2's point about trails cooling over time is valid but counterbalanced by the ongoing tip stream and accomplice arrests that continue to disrupt support networks. All forecasters appropriately weight Massey's 'serial escapee' status as a significant concern. The convergence around 60-65% reflects proper weighting of competing factors: strong manhunt performance (80% recapture rate) and substantial resources versus the selection effect (hardest to catch remain) and compound probability requirement.",
    "rationale": "Reviewing my analysis in light of the compound probability framing, I recognize that requiring BOTH fugitives to be captured does create additional risk beyond what I fully incorporated. If we assumed complete independence with individual probabilities around 65-70%, we'd get joint probabilities in the 45-52% range. However, several factors justify being in the low 60s rather than the 50s: (1) The captures are not fully independent - apprehending one could provide actionable intelligence on the other, and resources can be concentrated on a single remaining target; (2) The manhunt has demonstrated exceptional effectiveness with an 80% success rate within two weeks; (3) The massive resource deployment (200+ officers, federal agencies, $100,000 in rewards) remains active; (4) The systematic dismantling of support networks through 14 accomplice arrests; (5) 32 days remains substantial time. While Massey's escape expertise is concerning, the combination of modern surveillance, intensive manhunt, and adequate timeframe suggests better-than-even odds for both recaptures. I'm adjusting slightly downward to more explicitly account for the compound probability concern while maintaining that non-independence and manhunt effectiveness justify staying in the low 60s range.",
