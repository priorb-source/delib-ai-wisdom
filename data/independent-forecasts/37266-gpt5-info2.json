  "information": "The U.S. State Department uses a four-level travel advisory system. Level 1 is 'Exercise Normal Precautions.' Level 2 is 'Exercise Increased Caution,' for heightened safety and security risks. Level 3, 'Reconsider Travel,' signifies serious risks. Level 4, 'Do Not Travel,' is the highest level, typically applied in cases of widespread violent conflict, civil war, uncontrolled crime, risk of wrongful detention, or severe breakdowns in national infrastructure. The advisories are determined based on factors including crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and health concerns. The State Department reviews advisories for Level 3 and 4 countries at least every six months.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Mozambique’s overall advisory has typically been below Level 4, with “Do Not Travel” applied to specific northern areas (e.g., parts of Cabo Delgado) rather than nationwide.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Protests remain sporadic and localized; the Cabo Delgado insurgency stays geographically contained; no nationwide breakdown in security or infrastructure; State Department maintains the current country level (or at most raises to Level 3) with regional Level 4 restrictions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp, national-scale deterioration occurs before July 1: widespread violent unrest or a political/security crisis in major cities; insurgent activity expands well beyond the north; a catastrophic cyclone/epidemic triggers severe infrastructure collapse; the U.S. issues a countrywide Level 4 and potentially orders departure of non‑emergency embassy staff.",
    "rationale": "The State Department reserves Level 4 (“Do Not Travel”) for the most extreme, often nationwide risks (e.g., war, state collapse, pervasive violent crime/kidnapping, or severe infrastructure failure). Historically, Mozambique’s overall level has been lower (often Level 2) with “Do Not Travel” applied sub‑nationally to parts of Cabo Delgado due to terrorism. While ATTA flagged protests, the U.S. typically escalates to Level 3 before a nationwide Level 4 unless there is a sudden, countrywide crisis. The remaining window is short (~2 months), cyclone season is waning by May–June, and recent years’ security problems have been concentrated in the north. That said, Mozambique’s risk is higher than a typical country because of the insurgency and periodic unrest, so a rapid escalation is not impossible. I would raise the probability if: (1) credible reports show nationwide violent protests or a major political crisis; (2) insurgent attacks spread to new provinces or major cities; (3) the U.S. issues an ordered/authorized departure or upgrades Mozambique to Level 3 with strong language; or (4) a severe disaster (cyclone, cholera) produces widespread service collapse. I would lower it if conditions remain stable, protests dissipate, and there are no major security alerts from the U.S. Embassy. The research assistant’s note that Level 4 is reserved for severe, nationwide risks and that reviews occur regularly supports a low base rate within a short time frame. This isn’t higher because a countrywide Level 4 would require an unusually severe shift; it isn’t lower because Mozambique’s conflict and protest risks are non‑trivial compared to global averages.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mozambique receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMSN: [ATTA issues travel advisory for Mozambique amid protests](https://www.msn.com/en-za/travel/travel-preparation/atta-issues-travel-advisory-for-mozambique-amid-protests/ar-AA1wHavB?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Mozambique has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Mozambique.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. State Department uses a four-level travel advisory system. Level 1 is 'Exercise Normal Precautions.' Level 2 is 'Exercise Increased Caution,' for heightened safety and security risks. Level 3, 'Reconsider Travel,' signifies serious risks. Level 4, 'Do Not Travel,' is the highest level, typically applied in cases of widespread violent conflict, civil war, uncontrolled crime, risk of wrongful detention, or severe breakdowns in national infrastructure. The advisories are determined based on factors including crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and health concerns. The State Department reviews advisories for Level 3 and 4 countries at least every six months.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
