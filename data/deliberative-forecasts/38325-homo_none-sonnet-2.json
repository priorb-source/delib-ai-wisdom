    "review": "All three forecasters converge on similar reasoning: the -0.3% advance estimate is remarkably close to zero, making sign changes plausible through normal revisions, but status quo bias suggests weighting the initial negative reading. The forecast range of 35-45% reflects reasonable disagreement about how to balance these factors.\n\nForecaster 2 raises a valuable point I underweighted: the article notes the advance estimate was 'lower than expected,' suggesting market consensus anticipated positive growth. While market expectations aren't always correct, this provides weak evidence that preliminary data may have captured transitory weakness. However, I'm cautious about over-indexing on this - the BEA's estimate is based on actual data, not expectations.\n\nForecaster 3's more conservative 35% emphasizes that GDP revisions rarely flip the fundamental growth direction when the initial estimate is clear. However, I question whether -0.3% represents a 'clear' signal - it's essentially within measurement noise.\n\nThe key analytical challenge remains: with typical revision ranges of 0.5-1.5 percentage points and no systematic bias, a reading of -0.3% sits in a zone of genuine uncertainty. If revisions were normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation ~0.7 percentage points, we'd expect roughly 35-40% probability of flipping positive.\n\nNo forecaster provided information about the second estimate, which would be the most valuable update. All three appropriately note we'd revise significantly based on that data.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain that 40% is well-calibrated, though I see merit in moving slightly higher. The 'lower than expected' context from the article provides weak evidence for potential upward revision, as it suggests preliminary data may have missed underlying strength. However, this must be balanced against the reality that the BEA's advance estimate represents their expert assessment of actual economic data.\n\nThe narrow 35-45% range across forecasters indicates we're all grappling with the same fundamental tension: the reading is close enough to zero that normal revisions could flip the sign, yet we must respect that the initial estimate showed contraction. Given the extremely thin margin (needing only +0.31 percentage points) and typical revision magnitudes, probability near 40% appropriately reflects this uncertainty.\n\nI'm adjusting slightly upward to 42% to incorporate the 'lower than expected' signal while maintaining substantial weight on status quo. This reflects that while sign-flipping revisions are plausible given the narrow margin, the advance estimate's negative reading deserves respect as the baseline forecast.",
