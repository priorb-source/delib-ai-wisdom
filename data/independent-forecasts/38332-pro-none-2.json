    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The resolution deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, no announcement has been made confirming President Orsi's attendance.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Uruguayan government, after internal debate, decides that attending the summit is not in its best interest, possibly due to concerns about aligning too closely with BRICS members like Russia and China, or due to domestic political pressure. Alternatively, the government might simply fail to make a formal announcement before the July 1 deadline, letting the invitation lapse without a public decision.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Uruguayan government views the invitation from Brazil's President Lula as a significant diplomatic and economic opportunity. In the coming weeks, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the President's Office issues a formal press release or statement confirming that President Yamandú Orsi will travel to Rio de Janeiro to participate in the summit, highlighting the importance of strengthening ties with Brazil and other major emerging economies.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards 'Yes' primarily due to the geopolitical and diplomatic context of the invitation. The invitation was extended by President Lula of Brazil, Uruguay's large and influential neighbor and a key partner in Mercosur. Refusing such an invitation, or failing to respond, would be a notable diplomatic snub with potential negative repercussions for bilateral relations. President Yamandú Orsi's political alignment (center-left) is generally more ideologically compatible with Lula's government and with the pursuit of a multi-polar foreign policy, which engagement with BRICS represents. For a trade-dependent nation like Uruguay, the opportunity to engage with this significant economic bloc is compelling. \n\nMy probability is not higher because of the significant delay in accepting the invitation. The news from March 2025 indicated that participation was 'up in the air,' and the fact that no announcement has been made by early June suggests there are genuine reservations or obstacles. These could include domestic political opposition, a desire to avoid antagonizing the United States and European partners, or internal disagreement on foreign policy direction. The criteria for the question are also very specific – requiring an announcement of the President's personal attendance. It remains possible Uruguay will send a lower-level dignitary, such as the foreign minister, which would resolve the question as 'No'.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the diplomatic gravity of the invitation from Brazil is immense. In the absence of a major intervening event, accepting is the most likely diplomatic path. A positive announcement would reinforce regional solidarity and open economic doors, which are strong incentives. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there were leaks from Uruguayan or Brazilian officials about travel preparations being made or if other invited Latin American countries announced their attendance. I would decrease my forecast if prominent Uruguayan officials or opposition leaders began speaking publicly against attendance, or if reports emerged of external pressure from Western nations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
