    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short timeline and institutional inertia. Forecaster 2’s framing of the key tension (top‑down pressure vs. bureaucratic stickiness) aligns with my prior view and is persuasive. Forecaster 3 adds a strong claim about administrative procedures and public comment making a quick change unlikely; I’m less convinced that notice‑and‑comment constraints apply to CDC web guidance, so I find 85% too high. The main new consideration for me is the elapsed time since the April announcement without any visible CDC page change—this slightly strengthens the “status quo through July 1” case. The idea that HHS could simply pull or neuter the page remains the principal No path, but doing so now—weeks after the announcement—seems less likely than if it were an immediate move.",
    "rationale": "Netting the arguments: (1) Time is short and the agency signaled a review via CPSTF rather than an immediate suspension—this favors Yes. (2) A No outcome doesn’t require a full review; HHS could order CDC to remove or caveat the recommendation quickly, and the resolution would flip to No even without a new level—this preserves meaningful No risk. (3) However, the absence of any interim action since April suggests either internal resistance or a decision to proceed via process, making a sudden pre‑July 1 takedown less likely. (4) Stakeholder pushback (ADA/AAP/ASTDD) and reputational risk for CDC also disincentivize an abrupt web change without the CPSTF output. On balance, I slightly raise my forecast from 68% to 72% to reflect the shrinking window and lack of immediate follow‑through after the initial announcement, while still keeping a sizable No tail for a late, top‑down directive or page removal.",
