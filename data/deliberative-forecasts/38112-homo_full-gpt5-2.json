    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my priors: Brazil’s stabilise signal, unanimity, and the April foreign ministers’ failure to issue a communiqué make a July invitation unlikely. They add two useful angles: (1) leak dynamics—if a promotion were imminent we’d likely see sherpa-level reporting by now; and (2) optics—Brazil and India would likely resist polarizing candidates (e.g., Belarus, Cuba), making a “safe” pick (Malaysia/Thailand/Nigeria) the only plausible path. They also note Mexico’s incentives not to provoke the U.S., which further weakens the guest-to-member pathway. None of these points contradict my view; they slightly strengthen the case against imminent expansion while preserving a nonzero tail for a single consensual add if China/Russia push and Brazil relents for a summit deliverable.",
    "rationale": "Base case remains no new invitation before or at Rio: the host’s caution, need for unanimity across 10 members, lack of credible candidate-specific momentum, and the short runway argue against a July move. The new arguments about leak timing and candidate optics marginally reduce the likelihood that a surprise is already in motion. However, BRICS has an active expansion track and precedent for last-minute deals; a single, relatively uncontentious partner (e.g., Malaysia or Thailand; possibly Nigeria) could be floated as a compromise if China/Russia press for continuity of the expansion narrative and Brazil accepts a one-off. Triggers that would move me up include credible reporting of convergence on criteria and a named shortlist, or Brazil softening its rhetoric. I’d move down on explicit freeze statements from Brazil/India or finalized summit docs clearly deferring enlargement. On balance, I make a slight upward nudge from my initial read to acknowledge group judgment that a one-country deal is still plausible, but I remain below peers given the leak/agenda signals and host stance.",
