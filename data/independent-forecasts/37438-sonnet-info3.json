  "information": "In February 2025, it was reported that the U.S. federal government had paused $3 billion in funding designated for EV charging stations. Separately, on May 1, 2025, ChargePoint announced it had secured over $19 million in funding from the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to build charging stations in California. The company is also launching a new AC Level 2 charging technology with bidirectional capabilities, scheduled for release in Europe by summer 2025 and in North America by the end of 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 57 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - ChargePoint continues operations without filing for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint manages its cash position adequately through the next two months, continues to secure funding (as evidenced by the recent $19M NEVI award), proceeds with its planned product launches, and maintains normal business operations without needing bankruptcy protection before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint faces an acute liquidity crisis within the next 57 days - perhaps due to unexpected cash burn, creditor demands, failed funding negotiations, or accelerating operational losses - forcing management to file for bankruptcy protection before July 1, 2025 to restructure obligations and preserve value.",
    "rationale": "The extremely short timeframe of only 57 days is the most critical factor here. For ChargePoint to file for bankruptcy by July 1, they would need to be in immediate financial crisis right now. The recent evidence cuts against this scenario: on May 1, 2025 (just 4 days ago), ChargePoint announced securing over $19M from the NEVI program and is actively launching new bidirectional AC Level 2 charging technology. Companies on the verge of bankruptcy typically do not announce new product launches and funding wins. The base rate for public company bankruptcies is already low, and bankruptcies occurring within a 2-month window from apparent normal operations are exceptionally rare. While there are industry headwinds (the February 2025 pause of $3 billion in federal EV charging funding), this appears to be a broader policy issue rather than a ChargePoint-specific crisis. The reference to Q4 and full fiscal year 2025 results suggests they just completed a reporting period, which would have included disclosure of any material going-concern issues. My forecast is not lower (higher probability) because: the timeframe is extremely compressed, recent actions suggest ongoing operations, and no credible reports of imminent financial distress exist. My forecast is not higher (closer to zero) because: I lack detailed visibility into their exact cash position and burn rate, industry challenges could accelerate problems, and I should maintain appropriate epistemic humility about unknown factors. I would update significantly upward on news of: covenant violations, credit defaults, emergency board meetings, mass layoffs, or going-concern warnings from auditors. I would update downward on: additional funding announcements, strong balance sheet disclosures, or major commercial wins.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill ChargePoint file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[ChargePoint Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777393/000177739325000009/chpt8-kerfy2025q4exx991.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if ChargePoint Holdings, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn February 2025, it was reported that the U.S. federal government had paused $3 billion in funding designated for EV charging stations.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
