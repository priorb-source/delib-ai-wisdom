  "information": "The escape from the Orleans Justice Center on May 16, 2025, involved ten inmates and went undetected for seven hours. The inmates created a hole in a wall behind a toilet, climbed out through a maintenance area, and used a mattress to get over a barbed-wire fence. An investigation revealed significant security flaws, including chronic understaffing, with the prison at only 60% of required staffing at the time. A federal monitor's report had previously warned of a deteriorated security situation, citing inmates' ability to manipulate cell locks. At least three jail employees have been arrested in connection with the escape, which the Orleans Parish Sheriff believes was an 'inside job' aided by staff.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - as of the last report from May 19, 7 of the 10 escapees remained at large",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One or more inmates successfully evade capture by utilizing outside assistance from the staff conspirators, fleeing to other states, or hiding effectively in the New Orleans area or beyond until July 1",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Law enforcement successfully recaptures or kills all remaining escapees through coordinated manhunt operations, tips from the public, and investigative work tracing the inside help network over the next 32 days",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires careful consideration of several competing factors. On the positive side for complete recapture: (1) Three of ten inmates were recaptured within the first three days, showing a 30% early success rate; (2) This is a high-profile mass escape that will command significant law enforcement resources; (3) There are still 32 days remaining, which is substantial time for manhunt operations; (4) Media attention makes it harder for escapees to move freely. However, several factors suggest caution: (1) The critical word is 'all' - even one escapee remaining free results in a No resolution, which is a demanding criterion; (2) As of May 19, seven inmates (70%) were still at large after three days, and we're now 14 days post-escape; (3) This was described as an 'inside job' with staff assistance and at least three employees arrested, suggesting escapees may have received money, documents, or ongoing support; (4) The longer escapees remain free, the colder trails become and the further they can travel; (5) Historical data on mass escapes shows that while most escapees are eventually caught, achieving 100% recapture within a limited timeframe is challenging. The status quo strongly suggests at least some escapees will remain at large - they've already survived nearly two weeks of intense manhunting. My forecast would be higher if we only needed most recaptured (perhaps 70-80%), but the all-or-nothing nature of this question significantly reduces the probability. My forecast would increase if reports emerged of additional recaptures or if specific intelligence pointed to escapees' locations. It would decrease if escapees are confirmed to have left Louisiana or received substantial outside assistance beyond what's already known.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in the [2025 New Orleans jailbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Orleans_jailbreak) have been either recaptured or killed, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions). If any are still at large on July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe escape from the Orleans Justice Center on May 16, 2025, involved ten inmates and went undetected for seven hours. The inmates created a hole in a wall behind a toilet, climbed out through a maintenance area, and used a mattress to get over a barbed-wire fence.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
