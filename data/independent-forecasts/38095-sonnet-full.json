  "information": "In late May 2025, President Trump granted clemency to a large group of individuals. News outlets including The Hill and Politomix reported on May 28-29 that over two dozen people received pardons or commutations in what was described as a 'clemency spree' or 'blitz'. According to Office of the Pardon Attorney data, there were approximately 25 clemency actions in May. The recipients included political allies like former Congressman Michael Grimm and former Connecticut governor John G. Rowland, reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, and musicians such as NBA YoungBoy.\n\nSince taking office in January 2025, President Trump has granted approximately 1,600 pardons or commutations, a figure more than six times the total from his entire first term. A large portion of this number stems from a mass clemency order issued on his first day in office, which pardoned roughly 1,500 individuals convicted of offenses related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. The administration has installed key personnel to manage the process, including Ed Martin as the new pardon attorney at the Justice Department and Alice Marie Johnson as a White House pardon czar.\n\nDuring his first presidential term, Donald Trump did not grant any clemencies during the month of June in any of the four years. For his second term, a May 28, 2025, report from the Washington Times indicated that Trump has signaled more pardons could be forthcoming, including for two men convicted in the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. A White House official was also quoted stating the President has come to the aid of political supporters and donors and has expressed sympathy for allies caught in the judicial system.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 32 days. June 2025 begins in 2 days and ends on June 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - historically, Trump granted zero clemencies in June during all four years of his first term (2017-2020).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following his late-May clemency blitz of 25+ individuals, Trump takes a pause from granting pardons through June. He returns to his first-term pattern where June consistently saw no clemency actions, or he grants clemency to only 1-2 individuals, falling short of the threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues his second-term pattern of aggressive clemency usage established since January 2025. With infrastructure in place (Ed Martin as pardon attorney, Alice Marie Johnson as clemency czar) and reports of more pardons forthcoming (e.g., Michigan kidnapping plot defendants), he grants clemency to 3 or more individuals during June 2025.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires weighing two competing patterns. Trump's first term showed a striking pattern: zero June clemencies across all four years (2017-2020). However, his second term represents a fundamental shift, with approximately 1,600 clemencies granted since January 2025 versus ~250 in his entire first term.\n\nFactors favoring Yes: (1) Trump has institutionalized clemency processing with dedicated personnel; (2) He just completed a late-May 'clemency blitz' with 25+ pardons, showing active engagement; (3) Reports from May 28 indicate more clemencies are planned; (4) The threshold is very low - only 3 individuals needed; (5) The second-term pattern seems more predictive of current behavior than first-term patterns.\n\nFactors favoring No: (1) The historical June drought is striking and consistent; (2) The May clemency spree might satisfy immediate political pressure; (3) Summer months could see reduced activity.\n\nThe very low threshold of 'more than 2' is critical - this requires just 3 people, making it a relatively easy bar to clear given recent activity levels. However, I'm moderating my forecast because the first-term June pattern was so consistent, and the recent May activity might represent a batching of decisions that could reduce June activity. If Trump had not just granted 25+ clemencies, I'd be higher (75-80%). If the threshold were 10+, I'd be lower (40-45%).",
