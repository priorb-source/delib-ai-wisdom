  "information": "The escape from the Orleans Justice Center on May 16, 2025, involved ten inmates and went undetected for seven hours. The inmates created a hole in a wall behind a toilet, climbed out through a maintenance area, and used a mattress to get over a barbed-wire fence. An investigation revealed significant security flaws, including chronic understaffing, with the prison at only 60% of required staffing at the time. A federal monitor's report had previously warned of a deteriorated security situation, citing inmates' ability to manipulate cell locks. At least three jail employees have been arrested in connection with the escape, which the Orleans Parish Sheriff believes was an 'inside job' aided by staff.\n\nA multi-agency manhunt is underway, involving over 200 officers from local, state, and federal bodies, including the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The reward for information leading to the capture of the two remaining fugitives has been increased to $50,000 per person, with funds contributed by Crimestoppers, the FBI, and the ATF. As of late May 2025, law enforcement had received nearly 700 tips from the public. In connection with the escape and subsequent aid to the fugitives, at least 14 accomplices have been arrested, including family members of one of the escapees.\n\nAs of May 30, 2025, eight of the ten escapees have been recaptured. Some captures occurred out of state, including two inmates who were apprehended in Walker County, Texas, after a high-speed chase. The two fugitives still at large are Antoine Massey, 33, and Derrick Groves, 27, who are both considered armed and dangerous. Groves is a convicted murderer awaiting sentencing for a double homicide. Massey is described as a 'serial escapee' with three prior escapes from custody and was also being sought for kidnapping and rape. A former federal warden noted that Massey's housing in a first-floor cell was a significant security risk.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with the resolution deadline being July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "All 10 inmates are recaptured. The current intense, multi-agency manhunt, which has already proven highly effective, continues and leads to the capture of the remaining two fugitives before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the two remaining fugitives, particularly the 'serial escapee' Antoine Massey, successfully evades the extensive manhunt by finding long-term shelter with an unknown accomplice, crossing state or international borders, or otherwise going completely underground until after July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The sustained pressure from the multi-agency task force, combined with public tips prompted by large financial rewards and the continued disruption of the fugitives' support networks, leads to the location and capture of the final two inmates before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My high probability forecast is primarily driven by the overwhelming and highly successful law enforcement response to date. Capturing 8 of the 10 escapees (80%) within just two weeks demonstrates the manhunt's effectiveness and momentum. The massive resources deployed, including over 200 officers from local, state, and federal agencies like the FBI and U.S. Marshals, create an environment of immense pressure that is extremely difficult to evade for an extended period. Furthermore, the significant financial rewards ($50,000 per fugitive) and the arrest of 14 accomplices effectively incentivize public cooperation while systematically dismantling the fugitives' support network, making it difficult for them to access money, transportation, or shelter. The remaining fugitives are dangerous, which elevates their capture to a top public safety priority, ensuring resources will not be diverted.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the two remaining fugitives are likely the most difficult to catch. Antoine Massey's history as a 'serial escapee' is a significant factor, suggesting he possesses skills and experience in evasion that the others lacked. The first wave of captures often includes the least prepared, while the most resourceful remain at large the longest. There is always a chance they have found a secure hideout or have managed to travel a significant distance, expanding the search area dramatically.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the U.S. Marshals and FBI have exceptionally high success rates in tracking down fugitives. A full month remains before the deadline, which is a substantial amount of time for a dedicated, well-funded task force to operate. It is statistically very difficult for fugitives of this profile to remain at large for long under this level of national scrutiny and pressure.\n\nI would increase my probability if a credible sighting confines one of the fugitives to a specific, contained location. I would decrease my probability if several weeks pass without any significant new leads, suggesting the fugitives have successfully established a 'cold' trail.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
