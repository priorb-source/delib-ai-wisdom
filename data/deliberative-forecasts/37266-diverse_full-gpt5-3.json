    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the high threshold for Level 4 and the short time window—points I agree with and had already incorporated. They add the reminder that DoS is willing to upgrade quickly when warranted (e.g., South Sudan in March 2025), which underscores that a sharp escalation could flip this quickly, but that case featured nationwide instability more severe than Mozambique’s. Neither adds new evidence of triggers I’d weight heavily (e.g., Embassy ordered departure, major attacks in southern/central cities, or systemic nationwide unrest). Their probabilities (15–18%) seem to place more weight on tail risk than I do, but their framing nudges me to avoid underweighting a rapid-deterioration scenario.",
    "rationale": "Status quo is Level 3 with localized Level 4-type risks in the north (Cabo Delgado, now Niassa incidents). The U.S. typically handles such patterns with country-level Level 3 plus regional Level 4 restrictions rather than an across-the-board Level 4. To reach Level 4 nationally by July 1, I’d expect one or more of: (a) multiple high-casualty attacks in major population centers (e.g., Maputo, Beira, Nampula) or along key corridors; (b) targeting/kidnapping of Westerners or direct threats to diplomatic facilities; (c) Embassy drawdown/ordered departure; (d) widespread, sustained civil unrest leading to loss of state control across several provinces; or (e) major disruption to critical infrastructure (e.g., LNG corridor) with knock-on instability. We have recent expansion of jihadist activity into Niassa and protest-related advisories, but the violence remains geographically concentrated, and there’s no sign of Embassy posture changes or nationwide breakdown. With ~60 days left, the base rate of a Level 3→4 national upgrade absent a major shock is low. I’m slightly nudging up my forecast to reflect the possibility of a rapid cascade if Niassa/Cabo Delgado deteriorate further or protests intensify and spread, but I still see the modal outcome as maintaining Level 3 with regional warnings.",
