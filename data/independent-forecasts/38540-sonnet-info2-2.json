  "information": "In mid-June 2025, OpenAI released a new model, o3-pro, which is focused on high-performance reasoning and is available to paid users. The company has delayed the release of its first open-weights model until later in the summer, and reports indicate a potential GPT-5 release is delayed until July 2025. On June 10-11, OpenAI's services, including ChatGPT, experienced a global outage caused by a system error during a software update, for which the company announced a compensation plan for paid users.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 16 days. The outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025, and today is June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Unknown current ranking, but likely a competitive multi-way race among top frontier models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and potentially others. The leaderboard has historically shown frequent position changes among leading models.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A competitor's model (such as Claude from Anthropic or Gemini from Google) holds the #1 overall rank on July 1, 2025. This could occur if o3-pro fails to gain sufficient traction in user battles, if the recent June 10-11 outage damaged user confidence, or if a competitor releases a strong model in the remaining two weeks that captures the top spot.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "OpenAI's newly released o3-pro climbs to #1 overall through strong performance in arena battles, leveraging its advanced reasoning capabilities. Alternatively, GPT-5 releases earlier than the reported July timeline and immediately captures the top position, or an existing OpenAI model maintains the #1 position through the end of Q2.",
    "rationale": "With only 16 days until resolution, status quo considerations are paramount. The research assistant reports that o3-pro was just released in mid-June 2025, making it very new to the leaderboard. The Chatbot Arena requires substantial battle data to establish reliable rankings, which typically takes weeks to months. This short timeframe creates uncertainty about whether o3-pro can accumulate enough battles to reach #1, even if it performs exceptionally well. The recent June 10-11 global outage could temporarily affect user sentiment, though the compensation plan may mitigate this. GPT-5's reported delay until July means it likely won't factor into the Q2 ranking. Historically, the Chatbot Arena leaderboard has been highly competitive, with multiple organizations trading top positions. Without concrete data on current rankings, I must assume a competitive field. The reasoning-focused nature of o3-pro is a double-edged sword - it may excel in complex tasks but potentially underperform in general chat scenarios that dominate arena usage. My forecast is not higher because: (1) we lack evidence OpenAI currently holds #1, (2) competitors like Anthropic and Google have strong recent models, (3) o3-pro's novelty means uncertain performance, and (4) the outage may have negative effects. My forecast is not lower because: (1) OpenAI remains highly competitive, (2) o3-pro could perform exceptionally well, and (3) 16 days is enough time for a strong new model to climb if it's superior. I would update higher with evidence that: OpenAI currently holds #1, o3-pro is showing dominant early performance, or GPT-5 releases before July 1. I would update lower with evidence that: a competitor clearly holds #1, o3-pro is underperforming, or a strong competitor model launches soon.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill an OpenAI model be ranked #1 overall on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of the 2nd Quarter of 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMethodology: [Chatbot Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating LLMs by Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a model owned by OpenAI is in the number 1 overall rank (ties count) at the [Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this is not the case, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nScroll down to Arena Overview and the resolution is based on the \"overall\" rank.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn mid-June 2025, OpenAI released a new model, o3-pro, which is focused on high-performance reasoning and is available to paid users. The company has delayed the release of its first open-weights model until later in the summer, and reports indicate a potential GPT-5 release is delayed until July 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
