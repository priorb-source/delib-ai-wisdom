  "information": "The proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel, announced in December 2023, is valued at $14.1 billion, or $55 per share. The deal is currently under review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) due to national security concerns. President Joe Biden has officially blocked the merger, but the administration has delayed enforcement of the executive order until June 18, 2025. In response to the block, both Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have filed lawsuits claiming the ruling was unconstitutional. The case is being handled by the U.S. Court of Appeals, with a decision expected by the June 18 deadline. In early May 2025, a Nippon Steel executive was scheduled to visit Washington for meetings with government officials and Pennsylvania to meet with union members. An alternative offer from Cleveland Cliffs and Nucor to purchase U.S. Steel for $30 per share has also been reported.\n\nThe merger proposal has encountered significant political and union opposition. The opposition is bipartisan in nature. Former President Donald Trump has also voiced his disapproval, stating he would not support the deal and that Nippon Steel would not be able to acquire a majority stake in U.S. Steel. He attributed U.S. Steel's strong position to tariffs he had implemented. Following these remarks on February 13, 2025, U.S. Steel's stock price declined by 1.9%.\n\nSeveral activist investors have taken positions in U.S. Steel. Third Point, a hedge fund, disclosed ownership of 12.2 million shares at the end of the first quarter of 2025, with its leader, Daniel Loeb, expressing optimism that the merger can be completed. Another firm, Toms Capital Investment Management, held 4.9 million shares during the same period. U.S. Steel's stock has been volatile, rising 2.5% on May 9, 2025, after reports of progress in merger talks. However, market analysis has noted the stock trading at $44 per share, a significant discount to Nippon Steel's $55 per share offer.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the agreement remains in place (no Form 8‑K termination/abandonment filed) while regulatory review and litigation continue.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A court stays enforcement or rules favorably enough by/around June 18 to keep the agreement alive; or the parties simply continue litigating/negotiating and extend timelines without terminating. No Form 8‑K announcing termination is filed before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Enforcement of the administration’s block takes effect on or after June 18 without a stay, leaving the parties little legal room to proceed; they comply and file a Form 8‑K announcing termination/abandonment in late June. Alternatively (less likely), one side voluntarily walks away before July 1 in light of political/union opposition and files the 8‑K.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: There is a hard inflection point around June 18, when (per the assistant’s report) enforcement of the administration’s block is set to begin and an appellate decision is expected. That makes a late‑June termination plausible if there’s no stay and courts defer to the executive on national‑security/CFIUS matters (which they often do).\n- Incentives: Both companies are currently litigating and signaling commitment. Activist holders (e.g., Third Point) appear optimistic. That reduces the chance of a voluntary pre‑June 18 abandonment. Even after an adverse ruling, parties sometimes wait to assess appeal options; however, if a presidential/CFIUS order requires “abandonment,” compliance usually comes quickly, which would likely trigger an 8‑K in late June.\n- Market signals: The stock at ~$44 vs. a $55 offer implies substantial deal risk but not inevitability of failure. That gap speaks to eventual outcome uncertainty, not necessarily a termination within the next 6 weeks.\n- Status quo weighting: The default is that nothing is terminated before a decisive legal event, so baseline is No. The main path to Yes is a clear, enforceable block taking effect without a stay on/after June 18.\n- Why not higher: Parties are actively contesting; a stay or partial win would likely keep the agreement alive past July 1. Companies could also choose to litigate further before terminating, even after an adverse decision.\n- Why not lower: The political and union opposition is unusually strong and bipartisan; if a formal order requiring abandonment becomes enforceable June 18 without a stay, rapid termination is likely within the remaining June window.\n- Update triggers:\n  • Upward (toward Yes): Court denies a stay and upholds the administration’s block; confirmation that the order requires abandonment; company guidance about imminent termination.  \n  • Downward (toward No): Court issues a stay or favorable ruling; credible reports of continued engagement/extension; signals from CFIUS or the White House softening opposition; progress with unions or revised remedies that keep the deal alive.\n- Note on sources: The assistant’s report asserts an official block with delayed enforcement to June 18. If that proves inaccurate (i.e., no formal, enforceable order by then), the probability of termination before July 1 would be materially lower because the parties would likely continue the process rather than abandon quickly.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
