  "information": "Protests have been ongoing in Turkey since the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu on March 19, 2025, on corruption charges. Reports from various news outlets cited turnouts in the hundreds of thousands. The Republican People's Party (CHP) claimed that over 2 million people participated in a protest in Istanbul on March 29. The party announced plans for continued protests. Following the initial wave of demonstrations, Turkish authorities detained 1,133 people between March 19 and March 23. In response to the protests, nearly 1,900 people, including journalists, had been rounded up by late March.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Protests far exceeding the 10,000 participant threshold are ongoing, and organizers have announced plans to continue them.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A combination of an effective government crackdown that suppresses large-scale turnout and a potential lag in the Global Protest Tracker's database updates prevents a qualifying protest from being recorded before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Republican People's Party (CHP) or other civil society groups follow through on their plans to continue protesting, organizing at least one more rally with 10,000+ participants in a major city, which is then recorded by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the extremely strong momentum of the current protest movement in Turkey. The provided intelligence indicates that recent protests, triggered by the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu, have already drawn participants in the hundreds of thousands, vastly exceeding the 10,000-person threshold for this question. The main opposition party, CHP, has explicitly stated its intent to continue these demonstrations, providing a clear organizational structure and motivation for future events.\n\nThe status quo is one of high political tension and proven mass mobilization, which makes it the most significant factor in this forecast. The political stakes are high, and the opposition has demonstrated its capacity to gather large crowds. With just under two months until the deadline, there is a substantial window for another large event to occur.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 88% primarily due to two factors. First, the Turkish government's significant crackdown, involving nearly 1,900 detentions, could successfully deter future large-scale gatherings by increasing the personal risk for participants. Fear could suppress turnout below the required threshold. Second, and more critically, there is uncertainty related to the resolution source. The Global Protest Tracker is a curated database, not a live news feed. A reporting lag is possible; a protest occurring in late June might not be entered into their system by July 1, causing the question to resolve as 'No' even if the event occurred. \n\nMy probability is not lower because the catalyst for the protests—the arrest of a top opposition leader—is a very powerful mobilizing force. The reported turnout numbers are so far beyond the 10,000 threshold that even a highly effective government crackdown would have to reduce participation by over 90% to prevent a 'Yes' outcome, which seems unlikely. The low threshold makes the bar for a 'Yes' resolution quite easy to clear given the current environment.\n\nI would increase my forecast if the CHP announced a specific date for a major rally in May or early June. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if the government were to declare a state of emergency, if there were a sudden political de-escalation (e.g., İmamoğlu's release), or if several weeks passed with no significant protest activity.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 Turkish protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Turkish_protests)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
