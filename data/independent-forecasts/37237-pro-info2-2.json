  "information": "New tariffs, referred to as the 'Liberation Day' tariffs, took effect in April 2025. These included a 10% baseline tariff on most imports, with higher rates on certain categories like automobiles and specific Chinese products, where tariffs reached up to 145%. Following the implementation, early reports in April indicated a 64% collapse in new U.S. import orders. Real-time data showed significant drops in trade activity, including a 35% fall in scheduled container arrivals at the port of Los Angeles, a 30% plunge in U.S.-China imports according to Project 44, and a 40% decline in overall imports reported by Drewry. The S&P Global PMI also indicated a slowdown in U.S. business activity in April. Despite these indicators, the U.S. Treasury collected $16.5 billion in tariff revenue between April 1 and April 28.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The US Census Bureau typically releases the 'U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services' report about 5-6 weeks after the end of the reference month. Since today is April 30, 2025, the outcome will be known in early June 2025, in approximately one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "In a status quo scenario where the 'Liberation Day' tariffs were not implemented, US imports would likely have shown a modest year-over-year increase, driven by baseline economic growth and inflation. This would have resulted in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 'Liberation Day' tariffs, particularly the 10% baseline and higher rates on key goods, significantly increase the cost of imported products. This leads to a sharp reduction in demand and a collapse in import volumes, as businesses cancel or delay orders and consumers shift to domestic alternatives or reduce consumption. The total value of imports for April 2025 falls substantially below the April 2024 level, resulting in a 'No' outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the tariffs causing a drop in the volume of imported goods, the price effect on the remaining, essential imports (for which demand is inelastic) is extreme. The declared value of these goods increases so dramatically due to inflation and altered pricing strategies that it more than compensates for the volume decline, pushing the total nominal value of imports just over the threshold for a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is strongly influenced by the provided real-time data following the implementation of the 'Liberation Day' tariffs on April 1, 2025. This policy represents a significant shock to the trading system, moving us far from the status quo of gradually increasing imports. The evidence points overwhelmingly towards a sharp contraction. Multiple independent, high-frequency data sources corroborate this view: a reported 64% collapse in new import orders, a 35% fall in container arrivals at a major port (Los Angeles), and estimates of a 30-40% overall decline in import activity from industry trackers like Project 44 and Drewry. This multi-faceted evidence of a severe drop in trade volume makes it highly improbable that the total value of imports will exceed the previous year's figure. The slowdown indicated by the S&P Global PMI further suggests weakening domestic demand, which would compound the negative effect of the tariffs. My forecast is not lower than 5% because there is always a degree of uncertainty. The final Census data could diverge from the real-time trackers, and the price effect of tariffs on the remaining imports could partially offset the volume drop more than anticipated. The $16.5 billion in tariff revenue collected confirms that a substantial value of goods still entered the country. My forecast is not higher than 5% because the magnitude of the reported decline in activity (30-40%) is simply too large to overcome. For a 'Yes' outcome, the value of imports would need to increase year-over-year, which contradicts all available leading indicators. I would raise my probability if new data emerged showing the real-time shipping trackers were fundamentally flawed or if there were reports of a massive surge in high-value, tariff-exempt goods. I would lower my probability if preliminary official data confirmed the scale of the collapse.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US imports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of imports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 338,483 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNew tariffs, referred to as the 'Liberation Day' tariffs, took effect in April 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
