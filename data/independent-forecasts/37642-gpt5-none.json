    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6.5 weeks (until July 1, 2025). The key decision window is the June 17–18 FOMC meeting, with only low-probability intermeeting actions otherwise.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the FOMC keeps the target federal funds rate range unchanged through June and signals patience pending more evidence on inflation and the labor market.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Inflation data into May remain mixed or only marginally cooler, the labor market stays resilient, and the Committee prefers to wait for clearer disinflation before cutting. In June, the SEP/dot plot guides toward cuts later in 2025, but no action is taken before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April–May inflation prints come in decisively soft (e.g., core PCE running near ~0.2% m/m or lower on a sustained basis), unemployment drifts higher and labor demand cools, financial conditions tighten, and the Committee uses the June 18 meeting to deliver a 25 bp cut (or, less likely, an intermeeting cut if a shock emerges).",
    "rationale": "There is only one scheduled opportunity (June 17–18) before July 1, making timing tight and pushing the baseline toward no change. Fed communications throughout early 2025 have emphasized the need for greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2% before cutting. After stickier inflation earlier in 2024/early 2025, the Committee has shown caution about easing prematurely. Absent a clear, multi-month run of benign inflation and/or notable labor market softening, the status quo is to hold until later in 2025. That said, a June cut remains possible if incoming data meaningfully surprise: two consecutive soft CPI/PCE prints, rising unemployment, weaker payroll growth, and tighter financial conditions could meet the Fed’s risk-management bar. The June meeting also includes a new SEP, which can provide cover to pivot if the data justify it. Why not higher: only one meeting remains before the deadline; the Fed has a high bar to cut given lingering inflation risk; guidance has leaned patient. Why not lower: the Fed is data dependent; a run of soft inflation and labor cooling is plausible, and an adverse shock could prompt an intermeeting response. Key updates that would move this forecast up: core PCE and CPI for April/May at or below ~0.2% m/m, a clear downshift in wage and employment indicators (higher unemployment, lower payroll gains), and signs of financial stress. Updates that would move it down: any re-acceleration in core inflation, continued strong job growth, or Fed communications reiterating a high bar for near-term cuts.

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement. Therefore, the effective date of the rate cut does not need to be before the resolution date, as long as the announcement is made before then.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
