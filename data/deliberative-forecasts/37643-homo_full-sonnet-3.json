    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling analyses that align on the fundamental constraints: the 48-day timeline is incompatible with program termination given statutory requirements, the rulemaking committee's first session occurs essentially at the resolution deadline, and current actions focus on restricting rather than terminating the program. Forecaster 3's lower forecast (4%) emphasizes an important distinction I underweighted: the objective specifically requires 'terminating' the program, not merely restricting it. This is crucial because the Keep_Track subreddit appears to be a detail-oriented project that would likely distinguish between substantial progress (restricting eligibility) and actual completion (program termination). Forecaster 3's reasoning about procedural impossibility is particularly strong - the rulemaking process is literally just beginning at the resolution date, making formalization of any changes by July 1 essentially impossible. Both forecasters correctly note there's no indication of imminent Congressional action, which would be necessary for true termination. The main uncertainty all three of us identify is how the tracker maintainers define 'complete,' but Forecaster 3 makes the better argument that a detail-oriented tracking project would use precise definitions.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I over-estimated the probability that partial restrictions would satisfy the 'termination' objective. The research assistant's report shows the program remains legally operational under federal statute, and current actions only propose limiting eligibility definitions. The Keep_Track project appears methodical in distinguishing between 'in progress' and 'complete' statuses. Given that: (1) true termination requires Congressional action with no current legislative momentum, (2) the regulatory process timeline extends well beyond July 1, (3) the program continues to legally exist and operate, and (4) the objective specifically states 'terminate' rather than 'restrict,' the probability should be lower. My original 10% gave too much weight to uncertain tracker criteria and not enough to the clear procedural impossibilities. The small remaining probability (4-5%) accounts for unexpected rapid Congressional action or the remote possibility that tracker maintainers might interpret comprehensive eligibility restrictions as achieving the termination objective.",
