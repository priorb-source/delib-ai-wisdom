  "information": "The most recent poll, conducted on April 22, 2025, projects the Progressive Reform Party (VHP) winning 29% of seats, the National Democratic Party (NDP) 24%, and the National Party of Suriname (NPS) 14%. An earlier poll from January 2025 showed the NDP at 54% and the VHP at 29%. The incumbent VHP, led by President Chandrikapersad Santokhi, aims to secure at least 26 of the 51 available seats in the National Assembly. The opposition NDP has publicly ruled out any post-election collaboration with the VHP.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month, as the election must be held by May 25, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The incumbent Progressive Reform Party (VHP) is leading in the most recent polls, making a victory for them the status quo outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The National Democratic Party (NDP) capitalizes on any remaining voter discontent with the VHP's economic austerity measures, reversing its recent polling decline and securing a narrow plurality of seats on election day.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The VHP maintains its current momentum, and President Chandrikapersad Santokhi's message of economic stability and reform continues to gain traction with the electorate, leading the party to win the most seats as projected by the latest poll.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the most recent polling data and the significant shift in political momentum it reveals. The April 22, 2025 poll shows the incumbent Progressive Reform Party (VHP) leading with a projected 29% of seats, ahead of the National Democratic Party (NDP) at 24%. As the question resolves on a plurality, this latest poll directly supports a 'Yes' outcome. The status quo, with the VHP as the governing party and now leading in polls, favors this result.\n\nThe most telling factor is the trend. A poll from January 2025 showed the NDP with a massive 54% to the VHP's 29%. The complete reversal of this lead in just three months indicates a collapse in support for the NDP and powerful momentum for the VHP. Such a strong trend is unlikely to fully reverse again in the short time remaining before the election without a major catalyst.\n\nMy confidence is not higher because the dramatic swing in polls also highlights the volatility of the Surinamese electorate. The NDP's previously high support suggests a large base that could potentially be re-energized. Furthermore, a 5-point lead in a single poll can be subject to margins of error and last-minute shifts in voter sentiment, especially if there are undecided voters who break for the opposition.\n\nMy confidence is not lower because the available evidence points clearly in one direction. The most recent data is the most relevant, and it shows the VHP in the lead. The momentum is undeniable and gives the VHP a significant advantage heading into the final weeks of the campaign.\n\nI would increase my forecast if subsequent polls show the VHP widening its lead or if the NDP campaign suffers a significant public setback. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if new polls show the race tightening or the NDP regaining the lead, or if a major scandal were to emerge concerning the VHP-led government.",
