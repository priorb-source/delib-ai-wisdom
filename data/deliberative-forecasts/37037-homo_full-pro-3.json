    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of this question. We all identify the in-place 50% tariff, the extremely short timeframe until resolution, and the US's explicit exclusion of Lesotho from a 90-day pause as the overwhelming evidence for a 'Yes' outcome. The consensus is that the status quo is very strong. The minor difference in forecasts—85% vs. 90%—stems from a slight variance in how much weight we assign to the possibility of a swift diplomatic reversal. Forecaster 3's argument that the 'poor optics' of the situation and the newness of the policy could make the US more amenable to a rapid concession for a small country is convincing. This highlights a key uncertainty that I may have slightly underestimated.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 90% was based on the powerful inertia of an already-enacted policy, the short timeline, and the very strong signal sent when the U.S. explicitly excluded Lesotho from a tariff pause. After reviewing the other forecasts, I am adjusting my probability slightly downward. The reasoning presented by Forecaster 3, which places more weight on the 'non-trivial chance' of a diplomatic reversal due to poor optics and a new, flexible policy, is persuasive. While I believe the 'Yes' outcome remains highly likely, the argument that a reversal for Lesotho would be a low-cost political concession for the U.S. has convinced me to increase the probability of a 'No' outcome from 10% to 12%. The core logic remains the same, but I am acknowledging a slightly higher chance of a successful, last-minute diplomatic intervention before the resolution date. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast from 90% to 88%.",
