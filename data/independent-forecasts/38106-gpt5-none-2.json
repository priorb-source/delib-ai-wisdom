    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month (≈32 days), until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The White House announces and executes a June travel schedule focused on allies or domestic priorities, with no Russia leg; relations with Russia remain tense amid the Ukraine war; any talks with Russia occur via third-country venues or lower-level channels; June ends without a presidential trip to Russian territory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, high-stakes diplomatic initiative leads to an in-person meeting with Vladimir Putin on Russian soil—e.g., a ceasefire/peace framework or a nuclear arms-control negotiation judged to require leader-level engagement in Moscow or St. Petersburg—and the visit is arranged on short notice and carried out in June.",
    "rationale": "- Time window and status quo: Only ~1 month remains. Presidential visits to adversary capitals are rare, typically planned and signposted weeks in advance. With no widely expected Russia visit on the horizon and the window so short, the status quo strongly favors No.\n- Historical base rates: Since the Cold War, US presidents have occasionally visited Moscow, but not frequently, and typically not within the first half-year of a term. Trump did not visit Russia in his first term; prior early-term Moscow visits (e.g., Obama 2009) occurred in a far less adversarial context than 2025.\n- Geopolitical context: US-Russia relations remain severely strained due to the Ukraine war and sanctions. A June 2025 presidential visit would entail significant political risk and would be extraordinary absent a major breakthrough. Such breakthroughs are usually telegraphed.\n- Logistics and signaling: Major presidential foreign trips, especially to adversaries, require complex security/diplomatic prep and are usually announced in advance. The absence of credible, public pre-announcements at this late stage strongly reduces odds.\n- Why not higher: Short time left, poor bilateral climate, rarity of such visits, and likely political costs make a June visit unlikely.\n- Why not lower: Trump is unconventional and has previously staged unexpected leader-level meetings (e.g., 2019 DMZ with Kim). A sudden peace initiative, arms-control gambit, or dramatic optics play could produce a short-notice Moscow visit. Such tail scenarios keep the probability above zero.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting from the White House/Kremlin of planned in-person talks in Russia; announcement of a Europe trip with an unspecified stop; clear signals of imminent Russia-Ukraine negotiations hosted in Moscow; Trump explicitly saying he’s willing to go and schedules aligning.\n- What would move me down: Official June schedule release without Russia and statements ruling out a Russia trip; escalation in Ukraine that makes such a visit implausible; firm indications that any talks will occur in a third country.\n- Research assistant: No additional information provided, so the estimate relies on base rates, general diplomatic practice, and the current timeline constraints.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit Russia before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits Russia.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
