    "review": "Both forecasters stress the short time window and the need for a clear trigger (e.g., ordered departure of embassy staff, major attack in Niamey) to justify a nationwide Level 4 change. I agree with that mechanism-based view. They also lean on the notion that the advisory has been unchanged for over two years; I’m skeptical that the page truly hasn’t been updated since 2023 given typical State review cycles, but even if it has been refreshed, the salient point is that it has remained at Level 3 through substantial volatility, implying a high threshold for an upgrade. What they underweight, in my view, is the U.S.–Niger diplomatic/security friction (e.g., U.S. troop withdrawal and reduced cooperation), which elevates the tail risk of consular drawdown—often correlated with Level 4 moves. Still, their emphasis on the short horizon and status-quo inertia is persuasive for trimming my estimate.",
    "rationale": "My original 23% leaned on elevated regional risk and the possibility of a diplomatic or security inflection (e.g., ordered departure) that would quickly push Niger to Level 4. The other analyses convincingly re-center the base rate and the short <60-day window: Level changes from 3 to 4 are uncommon without a sharp catalyst, and Niger has remained at Level 3 even through a coup and persistent localized violence. I still keep a meaningful tail because: (1) parts of Niger are already Level 4, (2) neighbors Mali and Burkina Faso are Level 4, and (3) U.S.–Niger ties are strained, so a consular posture change is not out of the question. However, absent current signs of an ordered departure, a major Niamey incident, or overt embassy restrictions, the status quo is more likely over this brief period. I’m lowering my forecast to reflect that, while retaining some upside for a late-breaking trigger.",
