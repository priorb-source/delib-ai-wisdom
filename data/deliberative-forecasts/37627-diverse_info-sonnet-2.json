    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides critical new information about three recent Trump-Zelenskyy calls (February 12, March 19, and May 10), with the most recent occurring just three days before our forecast window begins. This establishes a clear pattern of communication every 27-52 days. However, I find their 80% probability too optimistic given that the May 10 call falls just outside our window - having just spoken may actually reduce the likelihood of another call within our specific 33-day timeframe. Forecaster 3's analysis closely mirrors my initial thinking at 57%, appropriately weighting the acknowledgment requirement and the diverging policy positions on ceasefire preconditions. The European 30-day ceasefire demand starting May 12 adds urgency, but the timing of the May 10 call is the most important factor neither of us initially considered.",
    "rationale": "The May 10 call is crucial information that cuts both ways. On one hand, it confirms active leader-to-leader communication during this critical period. The 27-52 day interval between calls suggests another call could naturally occur within our 33-day window (May 13-June 14). On the other hand, having just spoken three days before our window opens may have addressed immediate coordination needs, potentially pushing the next call beyond June 15. The Istanbul talks on May 15 remain relevant - if Trump attends in person, no phone call would be needed; if he doesn't attend, a phone call becomes more likely for coordination. The policy divergence Forecaster 3 noted (Trump wanting talks without preconditions vs. Zelenskyy insisting on a monitored ceasefire) does create pressure for direct communication, but they may have already addressed this on May 10. The acknowledgment requirement remains a meaningful barrier. Balancing the established communication pattern against the recency of their last call, I'm adjusting slightly downward from my initial 58%.",
