    "review": "Forecaster 2’s emphasis on policy inertia over a short window is directionally right, but they appear to assume the tariff is simply “in effect” rather than suspended; the key point for resolution is that the listing shows 31% regardless of suspension, which strengthens the case for Yes. Forecaster 3’s main uncertainty—that the 31% may not be formally in the HTS—conflicts with the assistant’s report that 9903.01.60 already lists Switzerland at 31% (marked suspended). Their broader point that Switzerland is a sympathetic ally and could be carved out quickly is valid, but with a 90-day suspension through July 9, there is reduced urgency to formally amend the HTS before June 1. Overall, F2’s logic supports a high probability; F3’s lower probability seems driven by an uncertainty that appears resolved and an overestimation of near-term reversal odds.",
    "rationale": "As of April 24, the HTS reportedly shows 31% for Switzerland under 9903.01.60, marked as suspended. The question resolves Yes if the cell indicates +31% on June 1, regardless of suspension status. A No outcome would require a formal action (e.g., presidential proclamation) removing or altering Switzerland’s rate and the USITC updating the HTS display before June 1. While possible—especially if a rapid bilateral understanding is reached—the 90-day suspension to July 9 lowers the likelihood of changing the published rate before June 1; negotiations can continue without altering the listing. Administrative inertia and typical update timelines further favor stability over the next five weeks. Compared to my prior 87%, Forecaster 3’s uncertainty about codification appears resolved in favor of Yes, marginally increasing my confidence. I am nudging up to reflect that the listing already exists and suspension does not affect resolution, while still reserving some probability for an early carve-out and prompt HTS update.",
