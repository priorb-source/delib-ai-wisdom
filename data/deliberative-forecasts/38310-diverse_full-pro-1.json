    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in broad agreement on the fundamental drivers of this question. We all identified the same key pieces of evidence pointing towards a 'Yes' outcome: President Zelenskyy's explicit and recent public commitment to attend, active logistical and security preparations by the host nation (Canada), his demonstrated willingness and ability to travel for key diplomatic events, and the strategic importance of the G7 summit for Ukraine. We also identified the same general risks: the inherent volatility of the war, specific security threats, and other tail risks. The primary difference in our initial forecasts was the weight assigned to these risks. Both Forecaster 2 (82%) and Forecaster 3 (85%) specifically highlighted the precedent of Zelenskyy's virtual attendance at the 2022 and 2024 summits. I find this a particularly convincing point that I had initially underweighted.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 90% to 85%. While my initial analysis was heavily weighted by President Zelenskyy's unambiguous statement ('I will be') and the host nation's preparations, the other forecasters correctly emphasized the precedent of his virtual attendance at two of the last three G7 summits. This precedent establishes that a switch from in-person to virtual attendance is a viable and diplomatically acceptable alternative for President Zelenskyy. This lowers the threshold for what might cause his plans to change. I initially believed that only a major military or security crisis would prevent his in-person attendance. However, I am now convinced that a more moderate development—such as a localized but intense flare-up on the front line or a pressing domestic issue—could be sufficient for him and his team to opt for the established fallback of a virtual appearance. By shifting my forecast to 85%, I am increasing the probability I assign to such a contingency from 10% to 15%, which I now believe better reflects the operational flexibility his team has demonstrated in the past.",
