    "review": "New, useful points from the others: (1) April 2025 BRICS foreign ministers reportedly failed to agree on a joint communiqué—if accurate, that’s a coordination red flag and lowers the near-term odds of consensus on admissions. (2) Kazakhstan’s president saying on May 30 that Kazakhstan isn’t seeking full membership removes a plausible ‘consensus-friendly’ candidate. (3) Some 2024 partner invitees (Algeria, Turkey, Vietnam) haven’t even confirmed partner participation, which weakens the immediate upgrade pipeline. I agree with the general structure: unanimity plus a short runway and Brazil/India caution make expansion hard; China/Russia’s push and the partner pipeline keep a non-zero chance. However, given these added frictions, I find their numerical probabilities (28% and 38%) high relative to current signaling. The host’s stated preference to stabilize, lack of credible leaks, and the need for a pre-cooked deal argue for a lower base rate by early July.",
    "rationale": "Time to decision is about five weeks. The host (Brazil) is signaling consolidation and the draft agenda is light on enlargement. Unanimity remains the binding constraint, with India and Brazil the likely brakes versus China/Russia’s expansion push. Since my prior 15% call, the additional signals—the foreign ministers’ inability to land a joint communiqué (suggesting coordination challenges) and Kazakhstan taking itself out—trim the short-list of low-friction candidates and reduce the likelihood of a late-breaking consensus. The fact that several partner invitees haven’t even confirmed partner participation further narrows credible fast-track options. While a single, consensus candidate (e.g., a relatively uncontroversial ASEAN state) could still be elevated quickly if leaders trade for a summit deliverable, I see no pre-summit leaks or alignment cues yet. Net: small downward adjustment.\n\nUpside triggers before the summit would be credible reporting naming a candidate with Brazil/India on board or explicit softening from Brazil; downside triggers would be on-record statements pausing expansion or authoritative agenda guidance excluding membership decisions.",
