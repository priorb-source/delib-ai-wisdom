    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (from May 30, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No arrest occurs",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service inquiry into the seashells photo concludes that it does not constitute a credible threat or criminal activity. The investigation, if any, extends beyond July 1st. Comey continues his life without facing arrest during this timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service or other law enforcement rapidly concludes that the '86 47' seashells photo constitutes a threat against President Trump (47th president), leading to immediate arrest. Alternatively, an unrelated legal matter surfaces resulting in Comey's arrest within the 32-day window.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires weighing an extremely low base rate against a short timeframe. Historical precedent strongly favors no arrest: former FBI directors have never been arrested in modern U.S. history, and high-profile federal arrests typically follow lengthy investigations spanning months or years, not weeks. The fact that Secret Service is merely 'asking' about the photo indicates we're in early investigatory stages, not near an arrest. Even if authorities determined legitimate concerns existed, arresting someone of Comey's stature would require extensive legal review, prosecutorial consultation, and likely grand jury proceedings - processes that rarely occur within 32 days. The definition's breadth (any arrest, anywhere, any reason) slightly increases the probability beyond near-zero, as does the compressed timeframe which could surprise. However, the fundamental constraints of legal process, historical patterns, and the preliminary nature of the current inquiry all strongly point toward status quo. I'm not going lower than 2% because: (1) 32 days isn't zero time, (2) political dynamics could theoretically accelerate unusual actions, and (3) the 'any reason' criterion marginally expands possibilities. I'm not going higher because the base rate is so low and typical legal timelines are so much longer. I would update upward only if credible reports emerged of imminent charges or grand jury activity; I would update downward if the Secret Service inquiry closed without action.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
