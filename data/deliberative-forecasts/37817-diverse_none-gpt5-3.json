    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a crucial, decision-relevant piece of evidence I hadn’t incorporated: the resolution source (FlightsFrom ROR) currently lists 6 direct destinations (TPE, MNL, GUM, BNE, POM, INU). If accurate, that flips the baseline from “probably ≤5” to “already 6,” making a Yes outcome the status quo. Their inertia argument is sound for larger carriers and near-term schedules. The main weakness is fragility: with exactly 6, a single suspension before July 1 would flip the outcome to No. Smaller carriers (e.g., Nauru Airlines, Air Niugini if involved, or any Manila operator) have higher short-notice change risk, and some services could be seasonal with potential schedule rollovers around July. Forecaster 3’s reasoning is sensible on planning cycles but lacks the key current-data check; that omission materially lowers its persuasiveness here.\n",
    "rationale": "I’m updating materially upward because the current FlightsFrom listing reportedly already shows 6 destinations. With only ~6 weeks to go, schedule inertia is a strong tailwind, and we don’t need additions—just continuity. However, the knife‑edge risk is real: if any one of the more marginal routes (Manila or any of BNE/POM/INU tied to Nauru Airlines’ network) drops from the schedules effective July 1, the count becomes 5 and resolves No. Larger/stable links (TPE via China Airlines and GUM via United) are unlikely to change, but smaller carriers can and do adjust with relatively short notice. There’s also the possibility that flightsfrom.com rolls to a new schedule view around July 1 that removes a seasonal route. Balancing these, I move from 20% to 70% to reflect the stronger status quo evidence while discounting for single‑point fragility.\n",
