    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until end of May 31, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of now there has been no declaration, and incumbents in Côte d’Ivoire have often announced closer to the election timeline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ouattara continues to keep his options open or decides to back a successor (e.g., VP Tiémoko Meyliet Koné or another RHDP figure). The RHDP delays its formal investiture to summer, and no official candidacy is declared before June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The RHDP convenes a May leadership council/congress that urges Ouattara to run; he accepts publicly during or immediately after the event. Alternatively, he uses a high-profile May speech or media interview to end uncertainty and declare.",
    "rationale": "- Time and precedent: The 2025 election is expected in October. In 2020, Ouattara’s definitive candidacy emerged around August, roughly three months before the vote. There is no immediate legal deadline forcing a May announcement, so the default is continued ambiguity into the summer.\n- Incentives: If he intends to run, an early declaration (by June 1) is possible to rally the RHDP and frame the race against an increasingly active opposition (e.g., Tidjane Thiam’s PDCI). However, Ouattara has historically valued tactical timing and may prefer to maximize flexibility while monitoring the opposition field and eligibility rulings.\n- Party dynamics: It is plausible the RHDP could stage an investiture in May, but absent specific, credible reporting of a scheduled May congress to nominate him, the base rate points to a later timeline.\n- Status quo weight: With no current declaration and no binding near-term deadline, the status quo favors “No” by June 1.\n- Why not higher: No confirmed May investiture date; past pattern of late announcements; no procedural need to declare by early June.\n- Why not lower: Political logic could favor removing uncertainty early; if the RHDP signals a May congress or if leaks indicate a settled decision to run, a swift declaration becomes more likely.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of an RHDP congress/investiture set in May with Ouattara slated to be named; senior RHDP figures signaling imminent acceptance; media leaks that he has decided to run; official mobilization campaigns and slogans rolling out in May.\n- What would move me down: Signals that he is grooming or endorsing a successor; repeated public statements deferring the decision; RHDP scheduling its investiture for June or later; indications of health or diplomatic factors that encourage delay.\n- Research assistant: No additional information provided, so this forecast relies on institutional timelines, prior patterns (notably 2020), and general political incentives.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Alassane Ouattara declare his candidacy for president of Ivory Coast (Côte d’Ivoire) before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAfrica Center for Strategic Studies: [Côte d’Ivoire: Efforts to Forge Resiliency Face Stiff Test](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/2025-elections/cotedivoire/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Alassane Ouattara declares his candidacy for the [2025 Ivorian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Ivorian_presidential_election), according to credible sources, before June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
