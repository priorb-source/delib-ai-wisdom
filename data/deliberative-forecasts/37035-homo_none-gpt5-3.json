    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my initial reasoning: Level 3 THNs are rare for yellow fever because vaccination is an effective mitigation; CDC tends to use Level 2 with strong vaccine guidance; and the ~5–6 week window makes a jump less likely. They also highlight useful triggers (urban transmission, vaccine shortages, traveler cases, PAHO/WHO escalation, CDC HAN alerts) and note seasonality in arboviral risk. No one supplied concrete new epidemiological evidence that escalation is imminent, but the emphasis on peak-season dynamics and the possibility of rapid deterioration are reasonable. I find their arguments sound and broadly consistent with my view; they nudge me slightly upward but don’t overturn the base case.",
    "rationale": "Resolution hinges on Colombia’s CDC Travel Health Notice showing >2 (i.e., Level 3) when checked on or after June 1, 2025. Today it’s Level 2. Historically, CDC reserves Level 3 for severe, widespread, hard-to-mitigate risks; yellow fever outbreaks in Latin America have usually remained at Level 1–2 because vaccination and precautions substantially reduce traveler risk. With only ~5½ weeks left, institutional inertia and the need for clear signals (sustained urban transmission, notable traveler cases, or vaccine access problems) make an upgrade unlikely. Media reports of economic emergency raise concern but don’t equate to CDC’s Level 3 threshold. I allow a modest tail for rapid escalation during peak season or if PAHO/WHO and CDC issue strong alerts indicating traveler risk despite precautions. Absent such developments, Level 2 persisting through the check date is the base case. I slightly increase my estimate to reflect peers’ points on seasonality and the non-zero chance of a fast-moving deterioration, but I still see No as strongly favored.",
