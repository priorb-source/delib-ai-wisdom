    "review": "My initial forecast was 15%. Forecaster 2 (30%) shared a similar rationale to mine, focusing on the high salience of the current tariff debate, but gave more weight to the long resolution window, leading to a higher probability for 'Yes'. Forecaster 3 (65%) provided the most compelling argument by completely reframing the problem. Instead of focusing on the story's dominance, they framed it probabilistically: a 'No' resolution requires a perfect streak of mentions in both papers every single day for over a month. They correctly argued that even a small daily chance of a joint omission compounds significantly over the 35+ day period. This mathematical framing is more rigorous than my initial intuitive approach and makes a much stronger case for a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast upwards, from 15% to 60%. The reasoning provided by Forecaster 3 was highly persuasive and exposed a flaw in my initial analysis. I was overly focused on the general importance of the tariff story, which is undoubtedly high. However, Forecaster 3's probabilistic model correctly highlights that the core of the question is whether this high importance translates into the specific word \"tariff\" appearing on the front page of *both* major newspapers *every single day* for approximately five weeks. The bar for a 'No' resolution—a perfect, unbroken streak of mentions—is exceptionally high. Major, non-related breaking news (e.g., a natural disaster, a Supreme Court ruling), slow news weekends, or simple editorial variance make it probable that there will be at least one day where both front pages are 'clean'. The primary obstacle remains the Wall Street Journal's 'What's News' section, which frequently carries brief economic updates. However, even this section's content varies daily. By framing the problem as the probability of a long streak failing, it becomes clear that a 'Yes' outcome is more likely than not. The 45-point increase in my forecast reflects this fundamental shift in my analytical framework.",
