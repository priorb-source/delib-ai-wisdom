    "review": "All three forecasters converge on remarkably similar reasoning and probability ranges (72-78%). We all identified the same critical factors: the substantial 22-seat historical gap from 2021, the Conservatives' consistent struggles in Quebec, the fact that Liberal-Bloc competition doesn't automatically benefit Conservatives, and Quebec's distinct political dynamics. Forecaster 3 helpfully quantified the magnitude of change required: Conservatives would need to roughly triple their seats while the Bloc collapses by two-thirds. No forecaster introduced fundamentally new evidence or arguments that challenge the core analysis. The consensus validates that we've identified the key factors correctly. The narrow forecast range (72-78%) suggests we're appropriately calibrated given available information. The main weakness all analyses share is the lack of current polling data, which represents a significant information gap. However, absent such data, relying on strong historical patterns and structural political dynamics is the appropriate approach.",
    "rationale": "My original forecast of 77% remains well-justified and sits precisely in the middle of the collective range. The convergent analysis reinforces rather than challenges my reasoning. The historical baseline is extremely strong: a 22-seat advantage for the Bloc is not easily overcome. The structural factors in Quebec politics - language, provincial identity, the Bloc's established francophone base, and Conservative weakness outside a few pockets - create high barriers to the kind of dramatic reversal required. While Carney's Liberal surge introduces uncertainty, it primarily affects Liberal-Bloc dynamics rather than Conservative prospects. The Conservative candidate issue mentioned in Quebec City actually suggests continued Conservative organizational challenges. For the question to resolve No, we would need both a historic Conservative breakthrough AND a Bloc collapse, occurring simultaneously in a province where Conservatives have never achieved such success. My 77% appropriately weights the strong status quo while acknowledging genuine uncertainty from the lack of current polling and potential for electoral volatility. No arguments were presented that warrant updating this forecast.",
