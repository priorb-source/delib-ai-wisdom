  "information": "US trade policy has been a factor influencing the dollar's value. In February 2025, the US administration implemented a 10% tariff on certain Chinese goods, and the possibility of tariffs on European Union products remains. The US President has mentioned potential 25% tariffs on EU imports, including automobiles. In a separate policy development, the German government announced a 500 billion euro off-budget defense infrastructure fund, which led to a 1.60% appreciation of the euro on the day of the announcement. In January 2025, Bank of America released a forecast projecting a stronger US dollar by the end of 2025, with a central forecast for the EUR/USD rate at 1.05.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known by July 1, 2025. The observation period is from May 12, 2025, to July 1, 2025, which is a period of approximately 7 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Major currency pairs like EUR/USD rarely move by the ~20% required to reach the 1.25 threshold (equivalent to 1 USD being worth under 0.80 EUR) in such a short timeframe without a massive economic shock.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The EUR/USD exchange rate remains below 1.25. This would occur if current macroeconomic conditions persist, central bank policies in the US and Eurozone remain predictable, and the threatened US tariffs on EU goods are not implemented.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The EUR/USD exchange rate exceeds 1.25. This would almost certainly require a major negative shock to the US dollar, such as the imposition of steep (e.g., 25%) tariffs on EU imports, sparking a trade war and a flight from US assets. A sudden US-specific financial crisis could also trigger this outcome.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the extreme rarity of a major currency pair like EUR/USD moving by the required 15-20% in under two months. The Bank of America forecast for a EUR/USD rate of 1.05 by year-end serves as a strong anchor, suggesting the market's central expectation is far from the 1.25 threshold (the point at which 1 USD is worth 0.80 EUR). The status quo and institutional expectations therefore strongly point to a 'No' outcome.\n\nThe probability is not lower than 10% because of the material tail risk identified in the research report: potential US tariffs on the EU. The presidential mention of 25% tariffs on EU imports, if acted upon, would constitute a major economic shock capable of producing the necessary volatility. Such an event would severely damage transatlantic economic relations and could trigger a rapid flight from the dollar. \n\nThe probability is not higher because this trade-war scenario remains a tail risk, not a base case. Imposing such tariffs would have significant negative consequences for the US economy as well, making it a politically and economically costly action. Therefore, while the risk is real and prevents a very low probability, it is not likely enough to warrant a higher forecast. I would increase my probability upon seeing concrete steps toward tariff implementation, and decrease it if trade tensions de-escalate.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
