  "information": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump have had several communications in 2025. On February 12, they spoke for about an hour about peace efforts and cooperation. On March 19, they spoke again, with Zelenskyy expecting to be briefed on Trump's prior conversation with Vladimir Putin. On May 10, following a meeting with European leaders in Kyiv, Zelenskyy spoke with Trump, stating that Ukraine was ready for direct peace talks if a 30-day ceasefire was agreed upon. On the same day, European leaders also held a joint call with Trump from Kyiv.\n\nA proposal was made for direct Russia-Ukraine talks to be held in Istanbul on May 15, 2025. Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to attend and invited Donald Trump to be present at the meeting. Trump expressed optimism about the talks and stated he was considering attending, but noted his schedule was busy. His schedule included a trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE from May 12, concluding on May 15, the same day as the proposed meeting.\n\nEuropean powers have demanded a 30-day ceasefire from Russia, starting May 12, warning of new sanctions if the demand was ignored. Donald Trump advised Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept talks with Vladimir Putin without the precondition of a ceasefire. Conversely, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine's readiness for talks was contingent on Russia agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire and providing for its effective monitoring.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "33 days until June 15, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - they would speak on the phone at least once during this period",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Communications break down due to disagreements over ceasefire preconditions, or they only communicate through intermediaries, in-person meetings, or other channels rather than by phone. Trump's busy international schedule and the Istanbul talks consume attention without requiring direct phone coordination.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump and Zelenskyy coordinate by phone around the Istanbul talks on May 15, or have follow-up discussions about the peace process, ceasefire terms, or next steps in the negotiations. Given they spoke just 3 days ago on May 10 and are in the midst of critical peace negotiations, they maintain their pattern of regular phone communication.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly suggests a Yes outcome. Trump and Zelenskyy have established a pattern of frequent phone communication in 2025, with documented calls on February 12, March 19, and most recently May 10 - just 3 days ago. This recent call indicates they are in active communication mode during a critical phase of peace negotiations. The Istanbul peace talks are scheduled for May 15 (2 days from now), and even if direct phone coordination doesn't happen immediately around that event, the 33-day window until June 15 is quite generous. Peace processes of this magnitude typically require multiple coordination calls between key parties. The status quo strongly favors continued communication given their recent pattern and the active negotiations. Factors that could prevent a phone call include: Trump's busy schedule (currently on a Middle East trip May 12-15), potential disagreements over ceasefire preconditions creating friction, or a preference for other communication channels. However, these seem unlikely to prevent all phone contact over a 33-day period. For my forecast to be higher (85-90%), I would need evidence of scheduled calls or more urgent coordination needs. For it to be lower (60-70%), I would need evidence of deteriorating relations or explicit statements suggesting reduced communication. The combination of recent communication pattern, active negotiations, and generous timeframe supports a high probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News: [Key moments that have shaped Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-zelenskyys-relationship-from-perfect-phone-call-to-oval-office-clash-13331892)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
