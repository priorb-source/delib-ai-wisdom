    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days (from May 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Chad is not currently listed as Available on the Starlink availability map",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite securing the license in November 2024, Starlink does not complete the necessary technical infrastructure, logistics, payment processing, or local partnerships required to activate service in Chad before July 1, 2025. The company prioritizes other markets or faces unexpected delays in equipment deployment.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink completes its operational preparations in Chad and updates the availability map to show Chad as Available before July 1, 2025. The company activates service following the 7.5-month period since license approval, allowing customers to order terminals and access internet service.",
    "rationale": "The key tension here is between the positive signal of license approval versus the status quo of Chad not yet appearing on the map. License approval in November 2024 cleared a major regulatory hurdle, and approximately 7.5 months have elapsed since then. However, the fact that Chad still isn't showing as 'Available' as of mid-May 2025 suggests either that infrastructure preparation is taking longer than typical, or that Chad isn't a priority market. Chad is a landlocked, developing nation with limited infrastructure and a relatively small addressable market, which may explain why Starlink hasn't rushed deployment. The timeline from license to service launch varies considerably across countries - some appear within 3-4 months, others take over a year. With 47 days remaining, there's technically sufficient time for Starlink to activate service if preparations are complete or nearly complete. However, the absence of any public signals about imminent launch (no announcements, local marketing, or equipment shipments mentioned) is concerning. Status quo bias suggests that what isn't available today is more likely to remain unavailable in the near term. My forecast isn't higher because we lack evidence of imminent deployment and 6+ months have passed without activation. It isn't lower because the regulatory approval is genuine, the timeframe is still within plausible bounds, and Starlink could activate service relatively quickly once infrastructure is ready. To update higher, I'd need evidence of active preparations, shipments, or announcements. To update lower, I'd need evidence of specific obstacles or statements indicating delayed timelines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Chad as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[SpaceX’s Starlink Secures License to Operate in Chad](https://spaceinafrica.com/2024/11/12/spacexs-starlink-secures-license-to-operate-in-chad/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Chad listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
