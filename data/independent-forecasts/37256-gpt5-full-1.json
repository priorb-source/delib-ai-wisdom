  "information": "South Sudan signed the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement in 2019 but, as of early May 2025, is one of the few states that have not deposited their instruments of ratification with the African Union. The ratification process requires a bill to pass the Transitional National Legislative Assembly, be signed by the President, and have the formal instrument lodged with the AU Commission. Historically, South Sudan's legislative processes can be lengthy; for example, the country took six years to ratify the Maputo Protocol.\n\nThe government of South Sudan is currently focused on several pressing domestic issues, including a delayed peace roadmap and preparations for national elections scheduled for December 2025. The country is also facing a fiscal crisis following a collapse in oil revenue due to a shutdown of a Red Sea pipeline. Further complicating the political landscape, the Vice-President and other senior officials were arrested in late April 2025. The national legislature has been meeting infrequently, sitting for only 32 days in the second half of 2024, and its published calendar for May-June 2025 includes no trade-related bills. Additionally, the Finance Ministry has not budgeted for the obligations associated with AfCFTA ratification, such as tariff reductions.\n\nOn the continental level, the AfCFTA has achieved 92% consensus on trade rules, with 49 of 54 African countries having joined the agreement. To support implementation, initiatives such as the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) have been introduced. Within South Sudan, both the Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Trade have publicly advocated for ratification, with the Trade Minister reaffirming the government's commitment at an April 2025 summit. In February 2025, the East African Community (EAC) launched a new trade committee in South Sudan to help harmonize standards with the AfCFTA framework.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — South Sudan does not ratify AfCFTA by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Transitional National Legislative Assembly (TNLA) does not table or prioritise an AfCFTA ratification bill during May–June due to competing crises (oil revenue collapse, election preparations, security/political turmoil). Even if a bill appears, it slips to later in the year, or passes too late for the instrument of ratification to be prepared and deposited with the AU before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The executive fast-tracks AfCFTA as a low-cost economic signal. Cabinet clears a ratification bill, the TNLA holds expedited readings and passes it in May/early June, President Kiir signs promptly, and the Foreign Affairs Ministry deposits the instrument with the AU Commission before end‑June—possibly tied to an AU/EAC event or donor engagement.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: South Sudan signed AfCFTA in 2019 but has not ratified. As of early May 2025, it is among the few holdouts that have not deposited instruments with the AU. Ratification requires TNLA passage, presidential assent, and formal deposit. Historically, similar ratifications (e.g., Maputo Protocol) have been slow.\n- Headwinds (status quo favors No):\n  • Legislative bandwidth is limited: the TNLA met only 32 days in H2 2024 and its May–June 2025 calendar reportedly shows no trade bills. Processes in Juba are often protracted.\n  • Political and fiscal crises: oil revenue shock, delayed peace roadmap, December 2025 elections, and late‑April arrests of senior officials all crowd out legislative attention. The Finance Ministry also has not budgeted for AfCFTA‑related obligations, signaling low near‑term readiness.\n  • Even if a bill passes, preparing and depositing the instrument with the AU is an additional step that can slip timelines.\n- Tailwinds (why not near-zero):\n  • Continental momentum: AfCFTA rules are largely agreed; regional peers (EAC) have progressed, and PAPSS is live. Peer pressure and optics matter.\n  • Domestic advocates: the Trade Minister publicly reaffirmed commitment in April 2025; Chamber of Commerce support; EAC launched a trade committee in Juba in Feb 2025 to harmonize standards—these create a pathway for rapid action if the executive prioritizes it.\n  • Ratification can be politically framed as cost‑light and implementation‑later, allowing a quick win even if tariff schedules and budgets trail.\n- Why my forecast isn’t higher: Only ~60 days remain, there is no visible bill on the TNLA docket, and the government appears preoccupied and capacity‑constrained. Fast‑tracking multiple steps (bill passage, assent, deposit) in that window is uncommon in South Sudan.\n- Why my forecast isn’t lower: Executives can and do push symbolic ratifications quickly when motivated. A single high‑level decision could trigger an expedited TNLA process and swift deposit with the AU.\n- What would move me up: official tabling of an AfCFTA ratification bill; inclusion on the TNLA order paper with expedited readings; cabinet clearance; public commitments with dates by the Trade/Justice ministries; evidence the instrument of ratification is drafted; AU/EAC announcements of an imminent deposit or special session.\n- What would move me down: TNLA adjournment or a calendar dominated by budget/election/peace bills; further political instability; dismissal or sidelining of relevant ministers; signals that tariff schedules or fiscal impacts must be resolved pre‑ratification.",
