  "information": "As of early May 2025, Muqtada al-Sadr has publicly and repeatedly reaffirmed his boycott of the 2025 Iraqi parliamentary election. In April 2025, he rejected a plea from the Iraqi President to reconsider his decision, stating he would not participate with 'the corrupt'. In March 2025, he forbade his followers from voting or participating in the election. A Qatari report from late April indicated al-Sadr is unwilling to take responsibility for the political mistakes of the rival Shia Coordination Framework. During a speech on May 2, 2025, he told supporters to 'speak out if their speech benefits reform, and remain silent if silence benefits reform.'\n\nThe Iraqi government has set November 11, 2025, as the date for the parliamentary elections. The Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) announced that the registration period for political alliances would run from April 15 to May 4, 2025. The political landscape is marked by significant divisions within the Shia bloc. The Shiite Coordination Framework, a major coalition, plans to participate in the election with at least six separate lists, though they are in discussions to form a post-election coalition. The electoral law remains a point of contention among political blocs.\n\nMuqtada al-Sadr has a history of reversing decisions to boycott elections. He previously reversed boycotts in 2014 and 2021. The 2021 reversal occurred in mid-August, approximately two months before the election. Despite his current boycott, al-Sadr has urged his followers to update their voter registration records. Some political sources have discussed the possibility of al-Sadr participating indirectly through an independent list to maintain influence, a strategy he has used in the past. In June 2022, after his party won 73 seats in the 2021 election, he ordered his entire parliamentary bloc to resign.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "59 days from May 3, 2025 to July 1, 2025, though the outcome could be determined earlier if an announcement is made",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Muqtada al-Sadr maintains his boycott and the Alliance Towards Reforms does not announce participation",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Al-Sadr maintains his boycott position through July 1, 2025, consistent with his March-May 2025 statements forbidding participation and rejecting the President's plea. The registration deadline of May 4 passes without his party registering, making participation logistically difficult even if he later changes his mind.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Al-Sadr reverses his boycott decision, similar to his reversals in 2014 and 2021. This could occur through a late-June announcement (following the pattern of his mid-August 2021 reversal that came ~2 months before October elections). Political developments, negotiations with rival factions, or strategic considerations could motivate such a reversal.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No. Al-Sadr has made recent, emphatic, and public statements rejecting participation (March-May 2025), including rejecting a direct presidential plea and forbidding followers from voting. The political alliance registration period ends May 4, 2025 (tomorrow), creating a critical near-term deadline. However, several factors prevent high confidence in No: (1) Al-Sadr has a documented history of reversing election boycotts in both 2014 and 2021; (2) His 2021 reversal occurred in mid-August for an October election, suggesting a late-June 2025 reversal (just before our July 1 resolution) would fit his historical pattern of announcing ~2 months before elections; (3) He has urged followers to maintain voter registration records, which could indicate hedging; (4) Past behavior suggests he may use indirect participation strategies. The forecast balances these competing considerations. It's not higher because the recent statements are very strong and the registration deadline is imminent, making participation mechanically difficult. It's not lower because the clear historical pattern of reversals and the timing dynamics suggest meaningful possibility of change. I would update higher if: reports emerge of behind-the-scenes negotiations, he softens his rhetoric, or the registration deadline is extended. I would update lower if: the May 4 deadline passes without registration and no extension is granted, or he makes even stronger boycott statements in late May/June.",
