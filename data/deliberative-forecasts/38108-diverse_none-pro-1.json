    "review": "The other forecasters provided compelling arguments that I had not fully weighted. Forecaster 2's framing of the $200 billion target as approximately 3% of the entire federal budget effectively underscores the sheer magnitude of the challenge, making a successful claim in such a short period seem less likely. Both forecasters also made a strong point that I had understated: the current lack of news or announcements is itself evidence. If the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) were on track to make such a monumental claim, we would likely have seen leaks, preparatory press releases, or other signals. This 'silence is evidence' argument powerfully supports the status quo 'No' outcome. Finally, Forecaster 3's structured breakdown of the two primary paths to a 'Yes' outcome (a single massive data release or a change in accounting methodology) clarifies that this would require a specific, non-routine event, rather than simple operational progress, making it a higher barrier.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 35% was based on the significant leeway provided by the resolution criteria, which hinges on a 'claim' rather than audited savings, and the strong political incentive for a new, high-profile department to post a large number. However, the deliberation with my colleagues has convinced me to lower my estimate. Their analyses rightly emphasize structural factors and base rates that I had underweighted. The scale of the $200 billion claim, as a percentage of the federal budget, makes the target extremely ambitious for the short one-month timeframe remaining. More importantly, their point about the lack of any recent announcements or signaling from DOGE is a powerful piece of evidence suggesting they are not currently close to the threshold. A last-minute jump of what could be close to $100 billion in claimed savings without prior groundwork seems improbable, even with aggressive accounting. I am therefore revising my forecast downward by 5 percentage points to 30%. I am not lowering it further because the possibility of creative, politically-motivated accounting (such as including multi-year projected savings in a mid-year report) remains a significant factor that keeps the probability of a 'Yes' outcome non-trivial.",
