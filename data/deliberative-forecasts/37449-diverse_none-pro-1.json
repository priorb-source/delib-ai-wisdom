    "review": "My colleagues and I are in strong agreement, with all forecasts falling within a narrow 3-5% range, indicating a consensus that this event is highly unlikely. The key argument raised by the other forecasters, which I had not sufficiently weighted, is the specific resolution requirement of a US *accusation*. They correctly pointed out that the US has strong strategic incentives to avoid the specific term 'blockade'—a word with significant legal and military implications—to manage the escalatory ladder. Forecaster 3's reference to past crises and actions around outlying islands, where the US deliberately used softer language like 'coercion,' provides compelling historical precedent. This insight is crucial because it means two separate low-probability events must occur: a blockade-like action by China, and a political decision by the US to officially label it as such.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 5% focused primarily on the low probability of China initiating a full-scale blockade within the short timeframe, given the immense economic and military risks. However, the other forecasters' analyses convinced me that I underappreciated the second, independent condition for resolution: the US public accusation. Their reasoning is sound; the US government has consistently shown a preference for strategic ambiguity and cautious language in past cross-strait tensions to avoid being locked into a specific response. Declaring a 'blockade' would be a major diplomatic and strategic step for the US, not just a description of events. Therefore, the probability is a product of two unlikely events: China's action *and* a specific US response. The combined probability is lower than my initial estimate. I am therefore updating my forecast downward to reflect this more nuanced understanding of the resolution criteria.",
