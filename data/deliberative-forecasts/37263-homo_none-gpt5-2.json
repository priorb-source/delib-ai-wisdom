    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: short timeline, small/protected market, and no public signals make a near-term launch unlikely. I found Forecaster 2’s emphasis on status-quo weighting and Uber’s current corporate focus (product breadth over small-geo expansion) a helpful framing, even if it doesn’t materially change the odds. Forecaster 3’s regional comparables (Jamaica DR/PR vs. islands that resist) are reasonable and consistent with my baseline. Neither adds concrete new evidence suggesting an impending launch; both acknowledge the narrow ‘Uber Taxi’ path with licensed taxis, which I had also considered.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is about 60 days. Baseline: Uber is not currently in TCI, and recent government-aligned messaging is focused on curbing illegal/unlicensed taxis. That posture typically correlates with caution toward ride-hailing in small island markets with strong taxi lobbies. Uber’s recent expansion strategy does not prioritize small, regulation-intensive jurisdictions, and launches generally involve regulatory buy-in and supply onboarding with public signals ahead of time—none of which are present. A Yes path exists via an ‘Uber Taxi’ model partnering with licensed taxis, which could technically stand up quickly if politically endorsed; however, absent any indications (government statements, MoUs, Uber job postings/listings, or local media leaks), the base rate argues for No by July 1. The others’ analyses reinforce rather than shift my view. Net: I hold at a low single-digit probability. Upward movers: credible reports of policy approval/pilot, taxi-association partnership, or Uber listing TCI. Downward movers: explicit prohibition or continued enforcement crackdowns naming app-based services.",
