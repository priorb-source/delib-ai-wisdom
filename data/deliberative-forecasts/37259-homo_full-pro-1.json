    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters, with each arriving at an identical probability of 5%. We all identified the same primary drivers pointing towards a 'No' outcome: the recently elected government's explicit gradualist platform, Greenland's significant economic dependence on Denmark, the establishment of a commission with a multi-year mandate, and the extremely short timeframe until the resolution date. The other forecasters introduced valuable nuances that reinforce this conclusion. Forecaster 2 articulated the most plausible (though still unlikely) path to a 'Yes' outcome, suggesting a symbolic announcement of a referendum for a distant future date as a political concession. Forecaster 3 added a powerful argument by highlighting the government's strong political incentive to stick to the platform on which it just won the election. Their reasoning is highly convincing and aligns perfectly with the available evidence.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of the other forecasters, I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. The deliberation has not uncovered any new evidence to significantly alter my assessment, but it has reinforced my confidence in the initial reasoning. The other forecasters' arguments strengthen the case for a very low probability. As Forecaster 3 noted, the new government has a powerful political incentive to adhere to the gradualist platform that secured its electoral victory; a sudden reversal would be politically illogical. This reinforces the core of the 'No' case. Concurrently, Forecaster 2 provided a clear articulation of the most likely, yet still improbable, 'Yes' scenario: a symbolic political maneuver where the government announces a referendum for a date far in the future to appease the opposition without altering its immediate economic focus. This scenario is precisely the kind of low-probability event that justifies keeping the forecast at 5% rather than a lower figure. Ultimately, the overwhelming weight of evidence—the government's stated policy, the economic dependency on Denmark's block grant, and the multi-year procedural timeline already in place—makes an official referendum announcement in the next two months extremely unlikely.",
