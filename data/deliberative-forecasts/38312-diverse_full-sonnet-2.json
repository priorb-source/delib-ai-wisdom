    "review": "All three forecasts converge tightly in the 5-8% range, indicating strong agreement on the core assessment. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the 'unambiguous diplomatic signal' of no invitation this close to the summit is compelling—this isn't ambiguous uncertainty but rather a clear absence of action where action should have already occurred. Forecaster 3 raises valuable points I hadn't explicitly considered: the 2018 precedent showing Canada can host G7 without India, and India's historical willingness to accept late invitations for high-profile multilateral events. The compressed program scenario (Modi attending just one in-person session) is theoretically possible but doesn't materially change the logistical calculus. Both forecasters provide similar update triggers to mine: official invitation news, advance team deployments, or conversely, published guest lists excluding India. The convergence around 5-8% reinforces that this is the appropriate range, with the modest differences reflecting minor variations in weighing the ultra-slim possibility of last-minute diplomatic breakthrough versus the overwhelming evidence of no preparation or invitation.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I maintain my assessment in the 5-8% range. The core evidence remains unchanged and overwhelming: no invitation with 12 days to go, no advance preparations, other countries already invited, unresolved diplomatic tensions, and domestic political pressure in Canada. The 2018 precedent cited by Forecaster 3 actually reinforces the No case—it demonstrates Canada has hosted G7 without India before. While India's potential willingness to accept late invitations is worth noting, this doesn't overcome the fundamental barrier that no invitation has been extended and time for proper preparation has effectively expired. Forecaster 2's characterization of the non-invitation as an 'unambiguous diplomatic signal' is apt. The minimal probability I retain (not going to 1-2%) accounts for: (1) theoretical possibility of extraordinary last-minute diplomatic intervention, (2) new PM Carney's stated interest in reset, and (3) India's geopolitical importance potentially motivating unusual flexibility. However, these are increasingly theoretical as June 3 becomes June 4-5-6 without movement. The convergence of all three forecasts in this tight range increases my confidence.",
