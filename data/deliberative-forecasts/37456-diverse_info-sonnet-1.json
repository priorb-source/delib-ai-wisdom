    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a crucial point I hadn't properly verified: the recall classification. If this is indeed Class III (least severe, no likely adverse health consequences), that significantly changes the timeline expectations compared to my initial analysis. Forecaster 3's 85% seems optimistic but is grounded in the strong signal that Class III recalls typically close within 60-90 days. Forecaster 2 offers a more balanced view at 40%, acknowledging both the typical Class III timeline and the conditional probability problem - given we're at day 40 without closure, something may be complicating the process. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize Cargill's scale and capability to execute recalls efficiently, which I underweighted. However, I find Forecaster 3's confidence too high given: (1) we're already 40 days in without closure, suggesting some delays or complications; (2) the March 2026 shelf life creates genuine verification challenges even for Class III; (3) the multi-state foodservice distribution adds tracking complexity that could delay effectiveness verification regardless of health risk level.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too pessimistic in my initial forecast. The key insight from the other forecasters is recognizing this appears to be a Class III recall (no illnesses reported, 'potential' contamination language, unapproved substance rather than pathogen). Class III recalls typically close in 60-90 days with a median around 90 days. At 95 days total (40 elapsed + 55 remaining), we're near but not beyond the typical window. However, I maintain some skepticism because: (1) The conditional probability matters - being active at day 40 suggests the process isn't proceeding at the fastest pace; (2) The March 2026 expiration date genuinely complicates effectiveness verification, as FSIS must ensure product recovery across extended timeframes; (3) Multi-state foodservice distribution requires coordinating with numerous institutional buyers. Balancing these factors, I'm updating upward to acknowledge the Class III dynamics and Cargill's capabilities, but not as high as Forecaster 3's 85%. The fact that 40 days have passed without closure, combined with the verification complexity, warrants maintaining meaningful uncertainty about whether all administrative and verification steps will be completed in the remaining 55 days.",
