    "review": "Forecaster 2 added specific operational facts I hadn’t explicitly weighed: cessation of fish farming in Dec 2024, culling stock, and effectively shutting the last operating site, plus the idea that a Chapter 11/363 sale might be the cleanest way to dispose of the Ohio facility if contractor/mechanics’ liens exist. That would increase the near-term bankruptcy hazard if they need court protection to deliver clear title. However, the analysis assumes liens or creditor actions without citing a concrete notice of default/lien filings. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on the short horizon base rate (sub-50% within ~8 weeks even for distressed microcaps) is persuasive, and the observation that firms often find stopgap bridges or pursue out-of-court sales aligns with my initial stance. The Epiq Partners note is weakly informative but directionally consistent with a non-bankruptcy path. Overall, F2 makes a good point about the potential utility of Chapter 11 for a sale, but absent hard evidence of liens, DIP/restructuring advisor retention, or a disclosed June liquidity cliff, I don’t see it as pushing odds above 50%.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is short (~56 days). As of year-end 2024, cash was ~$0.23M with a going-concern warning and statements that liquidity was insufficient. Additional details from the other forecasters suggest operations were effectively shut by Dec 2024, implying minimal operating inflows and ongoing G&A/holding costs. That profile keeps bankruptcy risk elevated, and a Chapter 11 could be a practical path if they need a 363 process to clear liens and maximize value from the Ohio asset. \n\nCounterpoints: low reported leverage (debt/equity ~0.05) reduces immediate secured-creditor pressure; many microcaps manage to avoid a filing for weeks–months via tiny bridges, payment deferrals, or out-of-court asset sales/ABCs. Importantly, they have already survived to early May without filing, which implies either drastic burn reduction and/or some form of interim cash inflow. With only ~8 weeks left, the base rate still slightly favors no filing by July 1 unless there is a disclosed liquidity cliff, creditor action, or a need to run a court-supervised sale on a June timeline. \n\nNet: I modestly raise my estimate to reflect the operational shutdown and plausible need for a court process to sell Ohio, but remain below 50% given the short window, lack of concrete lien/default/DIP signals, and the tendency for distressed microcaps to find stopgaps or pursue non-bankruptcy resolutions that would not trigger this market’s criteria. If the mid-May 10-Q indicates runway ends in June or discloses retention of restructuring advisors/DIP talks, I would move higher; any announced bridge financing or out-of-court asset sale that extends runway past July would move me lower.",
