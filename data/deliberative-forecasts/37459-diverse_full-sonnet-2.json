    "review": "The other forecasters raised several important points I should weigh carefully. Forecaster 3's observation about confidential treatment is particularly sharp - if Berkshire were accumulating a sizable position, they could request SEC confidentiality, meaning it wouldn't appear in the Q1 13F even if buying occurred. This actually strengthens the No case. Both forecasters correctly emphasized that Todd Combs and Ted Weschler have discretion to make purchases, and a small starter position from them could trigger a Yes resolution. Forecaster 2's 'fat pitch' argument about buying on weakness is theoretically sound, though the timing is problematic since the major tariff-driven selloff occurred in April, after Q1 ended. The year-to-date declines mentioned (Tesla -31%, Amazon -15%) include post-Q1 activity. However, I may have underweighted the possibility of a modest disclosed position, since ANY purchase counts for resolution, not just a major holding.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast slightly upward from 5% to 8%. The other forecasters correctly identified that I may have been too dismissive of the possibility of a small Todd/Ted-initiated position. Since any disclosed purchase triggers a Yes, even a starter stake matters. However, I remain anchored to the low end of the range for these reasons: (1) Warren Buffett's recent explicit comments about Mag7 companies requiring more capital directly contradict Berkshire's stated philosophy of seeking capital-light businesses - this is a powerful philosophical barrier, (2) The 10-quarter net selling pattern through Q4 2024 demonstrates sustained caution, not selective opportunism, (3) Forecaster 3's confidential treatment point actually reduces the Yes probability - even if buying occurred, it might not be revealed, (4) Q1 ended March 31, before the major April tariff shock and tech selloff, limiting the 'buying opportunity' window. The massive cash pile creates some deployment pressure, but Buffett's famous patience and the explicit recent comments about this specific sector outweigh that factor. While I acknowledge 5% was perhaps too anchored to near-certainty, the cumulative evidence still strongly favors No.",
