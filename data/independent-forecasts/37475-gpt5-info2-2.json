  "information": "The FSIS follows a structured process for closing recalls. This process involves verifying that the recalling firm has notified all its customers, confirming that the product has been removed from circulation, conducting effectiveness checks to ensure the product is no longer available to consumers, and verifying that the company has implemented corrective actions. For Class I recalls, which are deemed high-risk, the FSIS enforces more rigorous verification requirements before it can be closed. Recalls involving foreign material contamination necessitate a comprehensive investigation into the source of the contaminant and the implementation of effective preventive measures.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 52 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall remains listed as Active on the FSIS page on/after July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS effectiveness checks take longer than expected, the recall is expanded, or additional complaints/injuries surface, delaying verification that product is out of commerce and corrective actions are complete; the page still shows Active on July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Johnsonville completes notifications and product recovery, FSIS effectiveness checks pass, corrective actions are verified, and FSIS updates the page to Closed sometime in May or June.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: Many FSIS recalls, especially foreign material events of limited scope, are closed within roughly 1–3 months after announcement when firms are organized and distribution is traceable. This recall was posted April 5, giving nearly 3 months to close by July 1. Johnsonville is a large, experienced firm and the quantity (~22,000 lbs) suggests a finite lot scope, both supportive of timely closure. Countervailing risks: If this is a Class I recall (some foreign-material recalls are), FSIS may require more rigorous verification and root-cause controls, which can extend timelines. Multi-state distribution can lengthen effectiveness checks; any expansion or new complaints would also push closure past July 1. Research assistant summary reinforces that foreign-matter recalls require thorough source investigation and preventive measures, adding process steps that can slow closure. Why not higher: Unknown classification (Class I vs II), uncertain distribution breadth, and the possibility of expanded scope or lingering retail findings keep a material chance of remaining Active into July. Why not lower: Historical closure times for similar recalls often fit within the available window; no public signal here (yet) of injuries, expansions, or complex secondary distribution that would routinely prolong closure. Updates that would move me higher: Confirmation it’s Class II; FSIS updates indicating effective checks nearing completion; no expansion by late May. Updates that would move me lower: Recall expansion, additional consumer injury reports, or FSIS notes about extended effectiveness checks or ongoing corrective-action verification.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Johnsonville LLC of cheddar bratwurst for foreign matter contamination issued April 5, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReal Simple: [Over 22,000 Pounds of a Popular Sausage Brand Recalled Due to Contamination](https://www.realsimple.com/sausage-recall-2025-11711268)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/johnsonville-llc-recalls-cheddar-bratwurst-product-due-possible-foreign-matter) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe FSIS follows a structured process for closing recalls.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
