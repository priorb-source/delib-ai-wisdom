    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in complete agreement on the outcome and the reasoning. We all independently concluded that the answer is definitively 'Yes' with a probability of 99%. The core argument, shared by all, is that Ukraine's government debt has been substantially above the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold for years and the ongoing war necessitates continued borrowing, making a decrease below this level economically impossible. Both forecasters brought more recent data to the table, citing February 2025 debt levels at 6.65 trillion UAH and 6.05 trillion UAH, respectively. While the exact figures differ slightly, they both powerfully illustrate how far the current debt is from the threshold, thus strengthening the certainty of the 'Yes' outcome. Their reasoning is highly convincing and aligns perfectly with my own initial analysis.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 99% is unchanged. The deliberation with my peers has only strengthened my conviction in this forecast. Their analyses confirmed my own line of reasoning and provided more recent data points which make the case for a 'Yes' outcome even more overwhelming. As of February 2025, just one month before the resolution date, Ukraine's government debt was already over three times the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold. The economic fundamentals driving this high level of debt—namely, the financing of a major war and a large budget deficit—remained in place through March 2025. A 'No' outcome would have required a debt reduction of over 4 trillion UAH in a single month, a scenario that is not plausible outside of a massive data reporting error or a near-total, unprecedented debt jubilee. Since no new evidence or compelling counterarguments were presented, I see no reason to adjust my initial probability. The 1% chance of a 'No' outcome is maintained to account for these extremely remote tail risks, such as a fundamental error in the resolution source's data.",
