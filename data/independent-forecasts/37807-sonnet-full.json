  "information": "The current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is Brooke Rollins, who was sworn in around February 2025. Secretary Rollins has expressed support for SNAP reforms as part of a 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative, which is also championed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In legislative developments, the House Budget Committee has cleared a Republican spending package that includes proposed cuts to SNAP and stricter work requirements. Separately, Secretary Rollins plans to announce a USDA reorganization plan and further staff reductions in late May 2025.\n\nSeveral states are pursuing federal waivers to restrict the use of SNAP benefits for certain items. Nebraska became the first state to receive a waiver to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks, with the ban taking effect on January 1, 2026. Following this, Idaho submitted a similar waiver on May 16, 2025, to ban soft drinks and candy, with a decision expected in the coming weeks. Arkansas is seeking USDA clearance to make candy and soda ineligible starting in July 2026, while also proposing to add rotisserie chicken to the list of eligible foods. Indiana is also pursuing similar restrictions.\n\nChanges to national SNAP eligibility rules require either a congressional amendment to the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 or a formal USDA rulemaking process. The Act broadly authorizes SNAP benefits for 'any food or food product intended for human consumption.' In the past, the USDA has rejected state waiver requests to restrict specific food items due to concerns about implementation challenges, costs, and the potential impact on recipients. According to the USDA, approximately 20% of all SNAP spending goes towards sugary drinks and snacks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "42 days (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - 'snack foods' remains explicitly listed on the USDA's What Can SNAP Buy? webpage, as it currently is as of May 5, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The USDA removes 'snack foods' from the eligible items list on their webpage in the next 6 weeks, either as a preliminary policy signal, part of the planned late-May reorganization, or in response to political pressure from the 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative. This could occur through an administrative webpage update even before formal rulemaking or legislation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The status quo continues and the USDA makes no changes to the webpage listing. While there is political momentum for SNAP restrictions and state-level waivers are being pursued, bureaucratic processes move slowly and no concrete plans have been announced to update the national SNAP eligibility webpage by July 1. State waivers focus on specific items like soda and candy rather than broad categories like 'snack foods,' and even approved waivers don't take effect until 2026.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors the status quo outcome (Yes). As of May 5, 2025, 'snack foods' is explicitly listed on the webpage, and only 42 days remain until resolution. Key factors supporting Yes: (1) All concrete SNAP restriction actions to date are state-level waivers with 2026 implementation dates, not immediate national changes; (2) National SNAP eligibility changes require either Congressional legislation or formal USDA rulemaking, both lengthy processes unlikely to complete in 6 weeks; (3) Even Nebraska's approved waiver—the only one granted so far—targets specific items (soda, energy drinks) not the general category 'snack foods'; (4) No announcement has been made about imminent webpage changes. Factors creating uncertainty: (1) Secretary Rollins supports SNAP reforms and is planning a USDA reorganization in late May 2025, which could include webpage updates; (2) The Trump administration has shown willingness to move quickly on policy changes; (3) Updating a webpage is technically simple and could be done as a policy signal before formal implementation. However, removing 'snack foods' from the webpage before any formal policy change would be unusual and potentially legally problematic, as it would misrepresent current SNAP eligibility. The 6-week timeframe is simply too short for a major policy shift absent a clear announcement, which has not occurred. I would update toward No if there were announcements of imminent webpage changes or emergency rulemaking. I would update toward Yes (higher confidence) if we pass late May without changes during the announced reorganization.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is Brooke Rollins, who was sworn in around February 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
