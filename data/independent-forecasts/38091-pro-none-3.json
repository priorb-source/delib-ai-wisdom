    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with the resolution window closing on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new country signs the Artemis Accords in June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing discussions and diplomatic efforts by the United States, no country completes its internal reviews and diplomatic procedures in time for a signing ceremony within the 30-day window of June 2025. Potential candidates might be close to signing, but the official event is scheduled for July or later.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A country, likely one with emerging space ambitions or seeking to strengthen ties with the U.S., finalizes its decision to join the Accords and an official signing ceremony is held in June 2025, continuing the recent momentum of new signatories.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the recent rate of new signatories. There have been two new signatories in the last two months: Bangladesh on April 8, 2025, and Norway on May 15, 2025. This establishes a strong recent trend of approximately one new country joining per month. Given the active diplomatic promotion of the Accords by the United States and the growing number of signatories creating a 'bandwagon' effect, it is reasonable to expect this momentum to continue.\n\nThe status quo bias suggests that in any given short period, no change is the most likely outcome. Diplomatic processes are complex and can face unforeseen delays. A signing ceremony requires legal reviews, political approvals, and logistical coordination, any of which could push a signing from June into July or later. This is why the forecast is not higher; there is no specific public information about a country being on the verge of signing in June, so we are relying on a statistical trend which is not a guarantee.\n\nHowever, the probability is not lower because the pattern of signings in April and May is a strong signal of an active pipeline of interested nations. The U.S. State Department is likely cultivating relationships with several potential signatories simultaneously. Given this momentum, a month passing without a new signatory seems less likely than the trend continuing.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were official statements or credible news reports from either the U.S. or a potential signatory country indicating an upcoming signing in June. I would decrease my forecast if a key U.S. diplomat involved in the Accords were to be reassigned, or if a major global crisis were to divert diplomatic attention away from space cooperation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025. There are 55 signatories at the time of this question: Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay. [(source)](https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-oceans-and-international-environmental-and-scientific-affairs/artemis-accords)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country becomes an Artemis Accord signatory after May 30, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
