  "information": "Data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) indicates that California has the most reported UFO sightings in the US, with 36,286 sightings since 1974. Following California in total sightings are Washington, Florida, Oregon, and New York. NUFORC's public archive shows approximately 100-150 pilot-flagged reports are logged nationwide in a typical year, which averages 8-12 per month. The distribution of these pilot reports is skewed, with California and Florida being the two most common states for such reports, followed by a tier including Arizona, Texas, and Washington. In March 2025, a US Air Force pilot in California reported seeing 'three orange-like lights' hovering above Los Angeles.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days. The resolution will be determined when the National UFO Reporting Center's June 2025 pilot sighting data is accessed on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - California would have the most pilot UFO sightings, as it historically leads in both overall UFO reports and pilot-specific reports according to NUFORC data.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "California maintains its historical pattern and reports more pilot sightings than Florida in June 2025. Alternatively, another high-sighting state like Washington, Arizona, or Texas could also surpass Florida. With only 8-12 pilot reports nationwide per month, even a few additional reports in another state would result in a No outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Florida receives more pilot sighting reports than any other state in June 2025 due to random monthly variation, increased commercial or military air traffic patterns in Florida during that month, or unusual atmospheric or aviation events that generate more pilot reports from Florida-based flights.",
    "rationale": "Based on historical NUFORC data, California and Florida are the top two states for pilot UFO reports, with California generally leading. However, several factors create uncertainty: First, the monthly sample size is very small (8-12 pilot reports nationwide per month), which creates substantial random variation. Second, Florida is consistently a top-2 state, giving it a realistic chance of leading in any given month. Third, there's no indication of special circumstances that would favor either state in June 2025 specifically. The status quo strongly suggests California would lead, but the small sample sizes mean Florida has a non-trivial probability of leading through natural variation alone. If we assume California leads roughly 60-65% of months and Florida leads 30-35% of months (with other states occasionally leading), then 35-40% seems reasonable for a single month. My forecast is not higher because California's historical dominance is clear and there's no specific reason to expect June 2025 to deviate from this pattern. It's not lower because Florida is genuinely a top contender and small monthly sample sizes create meaningful variance. I would revise upward if I learned about increased Florida air traffic or unusual events in Florida that might generate more pilot reports; I would revise downward if June 2025 data showed California with a commanding lead early in the month.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nData from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) indicates that California has the most reported UFO sightings in the US, with 36,286 sightings since 1974. Following California in total sightings are Washington, Florida, Oregon, and New York.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
