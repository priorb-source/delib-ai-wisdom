    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize July seasonality and the knife‑edge nature of the >51 threshold, plus the importance of what is live on flightsfrom.com exactly on/after July 1 (suspensions right around the check date can flip the outcome). Forecaster 2 adds the useful point that even a single Gulf or European pause can swing the count, and highlights Saudi/insurance sensitivity. Forecaster 3 stresses that with ~6 weeks to go, schedules are mostly set, so upside from new adds is limited, but seasonal Med/Turkey/Europe routes could still push it over. I hadn’t explicitly weighted the “check‑date volatility” and Saudi secondary city exposure; those are good additions. Neither brought concrete new route announcements, so the updates are mainly structural and timing‑related rather than fresh evidence.",
    "rationale": "I still see the base case as slightly below the threshold given ongoing Israel–Hezbollah tensions, weak tourism, and European risk aversion. However, I’m nudging up from my prior 37% to reflect (1) July peak seasonality that tends to widen BEY’s network, (2) resilient VFR/diaspora demand supporting a broad Gulf–Iraq–Egypt–Turkey web, and (3) the plausible path to >51 if a handful of seasonal Med/Turkish/Greek/Egyptian points and a couple of European resumptions are live by July 1. Offsetting that, the outcome is highly sensitive to last‑minute suspensions around the check date; any flare‑up or insurance tightening could shave multiple destinations, and large last‑minute expansions are unlikely with six weeks left. Net: I modestly raise my odds but stay below 50% pending evidence that current listings already sit near or above the low‑50s.",
