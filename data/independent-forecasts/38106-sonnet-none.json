    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Trump does not visit Russia",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues normal presidential activities without traveling to Russia. Given ongoing geopolitical tensions related to the Ukraine conflict and the significant domestic political controversy such a visit would generate, no trip is organized in this short timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump makes an unexpected diplomatic visit to Moscow for urgent negotiations, possibly related to Ukraine peace talks or another critical bilateral issue that requires in-person presidential engagement.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Several key factors support this: First, there is only a 32-day window remaining, and presidential visits to foreign countries require extensive advance planning, security preparations, and diplomatic coordination that typically takes weeks to months. Second, my research assistant provided no information about any planned visit, suggesting no public preparations are underway. Third, historical precedent is important - Trump never visited Russia during his entire first presidency (2017-2021), despite expressing interest in improved relations with Putin. Fourth, the current geopolitical context makes such a visit extremely unlikely: Russia's ongoing conflict with Ukraine, where the US has been a major supporter of Ukraine, would make a Trump visit to Russia extraordinarily controversial domestically and internationally. Such a visit would likely face significant opposition from Congress, allies, and the American public. While Trump is known for unconventional diplomatic moves, visiting Russia under current circumstances would be exceptional even by his standards. The only scenario that would increase my forecast significantly would be credible news reports of travel preparations or official announcements from either government. The forecast is not lower because unexpected diplomatic developments can occasionally occur rapidly, though this remains highly improbable. The forecast is not higher because there is no evidence whatsoever of such plans, and the barriers - political, diplomatic, logistical, and temporal - are extremely high.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit Russia before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits Russia.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
