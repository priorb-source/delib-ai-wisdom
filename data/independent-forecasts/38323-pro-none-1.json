    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3 weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The recent reported 'plunge' in consumer sentiment suggests a strong negative momentum. Without a significant positive catalyst, the index is likely to remain in its current low range, at or below 60.0.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Persistent consumer concerns over inflation, exacerbated by new tariffs, and uncertainty regarding future economic growth keep sentiment depressed. The final June report reflects this anxiety, with the index remaining at or falling below the low levels seen in May, thus staying at or under 60.0.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A combination of positive short-term news, such as a noticeable decline in gasoline prices throughout June and a strong rally in the stock market, swiftly improves consumers' outlook. This late-month boost is enough to push the final sentiment index just over the 60.0 threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the provided context indicating a 'plunge' in consumer sentiment in May 2025 and the general macroeconomic principle that sentiment exhibits significant inertia.\n\nThe status quo outcome is 'No'. Following a sharp drop, it is more common for the index to stabilize at a low level or recover slowly than to rebound quickly. The recent negative momentum is the single most important factor, suggesting the baseline for June is already low, likely below the 60.0 mark. The Axios article's mention of 'tariffs' points to a specific headwind that directly impacts consumer prices and economic outlook, reinforcing the negative trend.\n\nFor a 'Yes' outcome to occur, there would need to be a significant positive shock to outweigh the existing negative sentiment. The most likely catalysts would be a sustained decrease in gasoline prices, a strong stock market rally, or a surprisingly robust jobs report. While possible, overcoming the fresh memory of the May 'plunge' would require a strong confluence of good news.\n\nMy probability of 35% is not higher because the downward momentum from a recent 'plunge' is a powerful force that is difficult to reverse in just a few weeks. The underlying issues cited, such as tariffs, are not typically resolved quickly.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the 60.0 threshold, while a mark of weak sentiment, is not insurmountably low. Consumer sentiment can be volatile and sensitive to short-term, highly visible data points. A few weeks of positive news could plausibly be enough to nudge the index from the high 50s to just over 60.0.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon seeing a strong preliminary June sentiment reading, a sharp drop in gas prices, or a significant equity market rally. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if the preliminary report shows further deterioration or if weekly jobless claims begin to rise.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be greater than 60.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is greater than 60.0 for June 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
