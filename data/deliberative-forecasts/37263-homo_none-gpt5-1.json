    "review": "Both forecasters make essentially the same case I did: short runway, protective regulatory stance, small-market deprioritization by Uber, and a narrow but real “Uber Taxi” path if government endorses it. The added comparators (Bermuda, Cayman) reinforce the small-island pattern of resistance and marginally strengthen the No case. I didn’t see any concrete positive signals I had missed. Their identified update triggers match mine. Overall, their reasoning is consistent and convincing but doesn’t introduce new evidence that would materially change my view.",
    "rationale": "Status quo strongly favors No: recent warnings about illegal taxis signal stricter enforcement and protection of licensed taxis heading into the summer. With only ~60 days left, a reversal or new framework plus onboarding and an Uber site update is unlikely without prior public signals. Uber’s current strategy and prioritization also make a small, contentious market like TCI a low near-term target. The main Yes path remains a government-approved Uber Taxi integration using licensed taxis, which could technically be spun up quickly if agreed—but there are no signs of such an agreement in process. Given the absence of new information and alignment among forecasters, I retain a low single-digit probability. I’d move up on credible reports of a pilot/approval or Uber listings/recruitment; down on explicit prohibitions or continued enforcement messaging in June.",
