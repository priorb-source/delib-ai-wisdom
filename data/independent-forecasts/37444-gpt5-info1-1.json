  "information": "On May 2, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly denied a Politico report that the administration was considering lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, calling the claim 'unequivocally false.' Both Rubio and U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum are reported to be opponents of the idea. Furthermore, reports from May 5, 2025, indicated that President Trump is considering a bipartisan bill that would impose 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian energy and expand existing sanctions.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 weeks (≈56 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Nord Stream 2 AG remains on OFAC’s SDN list when checked on/after July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Administration maintains or tightens Russia energy sanctions; Congress signals/advances tougher measures; OFAC leaves Nord Stream 2 AG’s SDN entry in place, as is typical even for insolvent entities.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden policy reversal: the White House orders OFAC to delist Nord Stream 2 AG as part of a broader Russia energy shift or deal; OFAC executes the delisting before or around July 1 so that a post–July 1 check shows the entity absent from the SDN list.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: Nord Stream 2 AG is currently on OFAC’s SDN list. The default (status quo) is that it stays there. OFAC rarely removes Russia-related designations absent a clear policy decision or a formal, time-consuming delisting process. With only ~56 days left, inertia strongly favors “No.”\n- Recent signals: According to the research assistant, on May 2, 2025, SecState Marco Rubio called reports of considering a lift “unequivocally false,” and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum is also opposed. On May 5, reports indicated President Trump is weighing a bipartisan bill to impose 500% tariffs on importers of Russian energy and to expand sanctions. These public positions point away from delisting.\n- Incentives and feasibility: There is little tangible upside to delisting Nord Stream 2 AG. The pipeline was never commissioned and was damaged in 2022; lifting sanctions would have limited practical benefit and significant political cost. Congress remains broadly hawkish on Russia; any unilateral softening would face swift backlash and potential legislative constraints. Procedurally, OFAC can act quickly if ordered, but such a U-turn would likely be telegraphed; instead, the latest signals move in the opposite direction.\n- Why not higher? The combination of official denials, talk of tougher measures, limited benefits from delisting, and short timeline make a policy reversal unlikely.\n- Why not lower? The Politico report suggests there was at least some internal debate, and this administration can move rapidly when it chooses. A narrow delisting of a largely defunct entity is administratively feasible if politically desired, so probability is not zero.\n- What would raise my forecast: Credible, on-record White House or State/OFAC statements signaling reconsideration; coordinated reporting from multiple outlets that delisting is imminent; signs the tariffs/sanctions expansion is shelved; evidence OFAC has initiated a delisting process.\n- What would lower my forecast: Passage or executive advancement of the 500% tariffs and expanded sanctions; new Russia-related escalations prompting tougher measures; additional energy-sector SDN designations; explicit, repeated commitments from senior officials that no delisting will occur.\nGiven the strong status quo bias and current political signals, a Yes outcome before July 1, 2025 looks quite unlikely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 2, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly denied a Politico report that the administration was considering lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, calling the claim 'unequivocally false.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
