  "information": "In late 2024 and early 2025, Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks, increasing its cash position to $348 billion by May 2025. The company reduced its holdings in Apple by 50% and also sold shares in Bank of America and Citigroup. New positions were initiated in Constellation Brands, while existing stakes in Occidental Petroleum, SiriusXM Holdings, Pool Corp, and Verisign were increased. During the first quarter of 2025, Berkshire's purchases included additions to Verisign, Sirius XM, and Occidental Petroleum, as well as an estimated $2.7 billion investment in five Japanese trading houses.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway first purchased 1.27 million shares of Domino's Pizza in the third quarter of 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, it increased this stake to a total of 2,382,000 shares, with the investment's value growing from $549 million to $1 billion. Multiple news articles from early May 2025, published after Berkshire's annual meeting, reported that the company had further increased its stake in Domino's Pizza to 7%.\n\nFor its first fiscal quarter of 2025, Domino's Pizza reported a 0.5% decline in U.S. same-store sales and missed revenue forecasts, but it exceeded earnings per share expectations. During that same quarter, the company repurchased 115,000 of its own shares. The company's 'Hungry for More' strategy aims to open over 1,000 new stores annually until 2028 and achieve 7% annual sales growth. As part of this strategy, Domino's is set to begin a collaboration with DoorDash in 2025, following a previous partnership with Uber Eats in 2023.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The Q1 2025 13F filing is due 45 days after the quarter ends on March 31, 2025, which is around May 15, 2025. As today is May 6, 2025, the outcome will be known within approximately 9 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Berkshire Hathaway began accumulating Domino's Pizza stock in Q3 2024 and increased its position in Q4 2024. The status quo, representing a continuation of this trend, would be another increase in the stake in Q1 2025, resulting in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Q1 2025 13F filing reveals that Berkshire Hathaway holds 2,382,000 or fewer shares of Domino's Pizza. This could occur if Berkshire's investment team decided Domino's was no longer attractively priced or if they prioritized other investments. It is also possible that the news reports of an increased stake were inaccurate or referred to purchases made after March 31, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Q1 2025 13F filing reports a holding of more than 2,382,000 shares of Domino's Pizza. This scenario aligns with multiple news reports from early May 2025 which stated that Berkshire had increased its stake to 7%, an amount that would exceed the resolution threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the provided intelligence that multiple news articles in early May 2025 reported Berkshire Hathaway had increased its stake in Domino's Pizza to 7%. A 7% stake would represent approximately 2.45 million to 2.5 million shares, which is greater than the resolution threshold of 2,382,000 shares. The timing of these reports, following Berkshire's annual meeting, strongly suggests the information pertains to activity in the most recently completed quarter, Q1 2025. This specific, recent evidence is the primary driver of my high probability estimate and is supported by Berkshire's previous pattern of accumulating Domino's stock in Q3 and Q4 of 2024. While Berkshire was a net seller of equities overall and Domino's reported mixed Q1 results, Berkshire is known for being a selective buyer and for its long-term investment horizon, which often looks past single-quarter performance. My probability is not higher than 95 because there remains a small chance that the news reports are inaccurate or that the purchases to reach the 7% stake occurred after the Q1 cutoff of March 31, 2025 (i.e., in April or early May). My probability is not lower because ignoring multiple, specific news reports that align with a prior purchasing trend would be an oversight. I would increase my forecast to near 100% with any confirmation of the reports or a leak of the filing. I would significantly decrease my forecast if credible sources refuted the 7% stake report or clarified that the purchases happened in Q2.",
