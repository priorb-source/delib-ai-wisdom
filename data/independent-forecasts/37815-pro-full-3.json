  "information": "The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) receives approximately 5,000-6,000 total UFO reports annually. The 'Pilot' report subtype constitutes about 1% of these, amounting to 30-60 reports worldwide per year. Non-US pilot reports are less frequent, with about 3-5 recorded annually from outside the United States. Reports from South American countries average around 1-2 per year. Specific examples of recent pilot reports from the continent logged in the NUFORC database include a sighting in Brazil in December 2024 and one from a Chilean Air Force crew in February 2023. The NUFORC system is based in the United States and uses an English-language reporting form.\n\nThe U.S. government's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officially document and investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). In 2020, the Department of Defense established a UAP Task Force to track and analyze sightings. According to official data, 757 UAP reports were documented between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. As of the latest report, only 49 of these cases have been officially closed. A report submitted to the U.S. Congress stated that of the 757 observations, no evidence suggested extraterrestrial origin; analysis indicated approximately 70% of the objects were balloons and 16% were drones.\n\nA number of high-profile encounters between military aircraft and UAPs have been reported in North America. In an incident on January 19, 2023, a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet collided with an unidentified object during a training mission over Arizona, cracking the aircraft's canopy. This event was one of 22 UAP sightings reported by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. Arizona, particularly near military training zones, is described as a hotspot for such sightings. Some U.S. officials have suggested these objects may be advanced drones. In a separate event on September 17, 2024, an Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with a dark grey, football-sized cylindrical object over California.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks. The observation window is June 2025, and the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Reports from South American pilots to the US-based NUFORC are very infrequent, with only one or two filed per year on average. The status quo is that a given month will pass without such a report being filed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The month of June 2025 concludes without any pilots in South America submitting a UFO/UAP report to the National UFO Reporting Center for an event that occurred during that month. This could be because no unusual sightings were made, or because pilots who did see something chose not to report it, or reported it through other, non-NUFORC channels.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial, private, or military pilot flying over a South American nation, such as Brazil or Argentina, observes an anomalous aerial phenomenon. This pilot is aware of NUFORC and chooses to submit a formal report of the sighting through its English-language online portal. The report is processed and posted by NUFORC to its public database for an event date in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the low base rate of qualifying events. The research indicates that NUFORC receives only 1-2 pilot reports from the entire South American continent per year. Assuming these rare events are distributed randomly throughout the year, the probability of at least one report occurring in any single month is low. A rate of 1.5 reports per year gives a monthly probability of approximately 1.5/12, or 12.5%. A Poisson distribution for a rate of 1 event per year (λ=1/12 per month) gives a probability of ~8% for one or more events in that month (1 - e^-(1/12)). I favor this lower-end estimate due to significant reporting friction: NUFORC is a US-based, English-language entity, which likely suppresses reporting from a predominantly Spanish and Portuguese-speaking region. While general interest in UAPs is increasing due to US government disclosures, this is unlikely to significantly alter reporting habits in South America to this specific US database in the short term. The forecast is not lower because such reports, while rare, are not unprecedented, as evidenced by recent examples from Brazil (2024) and Chile (2023). This demonstrates that the reporting pathway exists and is occasionally used. The forecast is not higher because there is no specific information—such as planned military exercises or an uptick in regional aerial phenomena—to suggest that June 2025 would be an anomalous month. I would increase my probability if there was evidence of a new NUFORC outreach campaign in South America or a cluster of high-profile sightings in the region in late May. I would decrease it if NUFORC's reporting system experienced technical issues or if a new, more prominent regional reporting center was established in South America.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in South America in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) a sighting in Brazil in December 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
