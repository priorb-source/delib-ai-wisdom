    "review": "Both forecasters reinforced the base-rate view that headliners rarely share a stage without explicit advance billing. The most useful additions were: (1) an explicit multiplicative framing—P(both attend in person) times P(shared stage | both there)—with concrete ranges; (2) the specific risk that Musk might appear remotely, which would not qualify; and (3) the reminder of the 2024 Musk–OpenAI legal clash as a current relationship headwind. I find these points credible and slightly underweighted in my prior. I agree that YC’s incentive for a marquee moment exists, but the security/PR/coordination costs and lack of any teaser for a joint segment three weeks out weigh against it. I’m persuaded to nudge down from my prior rather than make a large move, given the genuine tail that YC engineers a brief shared moment (opening/closing/photo).",
    "rationale": "(a) Time left: About 20 days until the event window opens (June 16, 7:59 AM PDT) and ~22 days until the window closes (June 18, 12:00 AM PDT).\n(b) Status quo outcome: No—separate sessions by default unless a joint segment is announced.\n(c) No scenario: Agenda lists distinct, non-overlapping slots; heightened security and logistics keep them apart; or Musk appears remotely/cancels.\n(d) Yes scenario: YC schedules a joint panel/debate; or orchestrates a brief shared on-stage moment (opening/closing/all-speaker photo/Q&A) with clear public documentation.\n(e) Rationale: Base rates for unsignaled joint appearances are low. Relationship dynamics remain adversarial post-2024 lawsuit, reducing both sides’ appetite for a joint stage without careful ground rules. Joint appearances add security/PR complexity. Musk’s attendance/format volatility (including the possibility of remote participation) further reduces odds. Countervailing factors: both are announced headliners in SF over two days, lowering travel friction and giving YC the option to manufacture a short, symbolic overlap that would satisfy resolution. Adopting Forecaster 3’s decomposition: P(both attend in person) ~0.70–0.75; conditional shared-stage probability ~0.20–0.25 yields ~14–19%. YC’s showmanship could push the conditional up slightly, but lack of any teaser three weeks out tempers that. Net: I revise down modestly from 24% to 19%.\n(f) Final forecast: 19%.",
