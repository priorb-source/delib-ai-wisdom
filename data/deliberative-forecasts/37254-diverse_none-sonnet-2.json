    "review": "Both forecasters present compelling arguments that I had underweighted. Forecaster 3's point about the **accusation threshold** is particularly important - the U.S. is careful with 'invasion' rhetoric and might use softer terms like 'incursions' or 'violations' for smaller-scale actions. This linguistic constraint significantly lowers the probability beyond just the operational constraints. Their **base rate analysis** is also valuable: Russia has invaded only 2 countries in 15+ years, suggesting an annualized rate that translates to roughly 2-3% over a 2-month period. Forecaster 3's geographical point about Moldova being hard to reach without going through Ukraine or conducting high-risk amphibious operations adds another constraint I didn't emphasize enough. Forecaster 2's focus on the 'monumental strategic risk' and 'formidable deterrents' reinforces that opening a new front would be exceptionally costly. Both forecasters identified the same potential scenarios but weighted the constraints more heavily than I did.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I believe I was too high at 5%. The combination of the very short 2-month timeframe, the linguistic threshold for what constitutes a US accusation of 'invasion' (versus softer terms), the base rate of Russian invasions (roughly 2 major invasions in 15+ years), and the geographical/logistical constraints on potential targets all point to a lower probability. The most plausible scenario remains something in Moldova/Transnistria, but even this faces significant hurdles: Russia's forces are overstretched in Ukraine, Moldova is geographically difficult to reach, and the US might characterize a limited action as an 'incursion' rather than an 'invasion.' However, I don't want to go as low as 2% because tail risks remain - Russia has demonstrated capacity for strategic surprise, and rapid escalation scenarios in frozen conflict zones cannot be entirely dismissed. A forecast of 3% better reflects the balance between these very low but non-zero probabilities and the significant constraints identified by all forecasters.",
