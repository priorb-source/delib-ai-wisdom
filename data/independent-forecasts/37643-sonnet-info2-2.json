  "information": "The U.S. Department of Education is establishing a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee, named the Student Loans and Affordability Committee, tasked with developing proposed regulations for federal student aid programs. A key focus of this committee will be to refine the definition of qualifying employers for Public Service Loan Forgiveness eligibility. The deadline for nominations for negotiators was June 1, 2025, and the committee is scheduled to hold its first session from June 30 to July 2, 2025, with proposed and final rules anticipated for release later in 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 48 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the objective remains marked as 'in progress' or another incomplete status on the tracker spreadsheet",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The PSLF program continues to exist through July 1, 2025, possibly with proposed modifications or restrictions under consideration but not yet implemented. The Project 2025 Tracker maintainers continue to mark this objective as 'in progress' because while actions may be underway, the program has not been completely terminated.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration takes immediate executive action to completely terminate the PSLF program through regulatory changes or administrative orders within the next 48 days, and the Keep_Track subreddit moderators update the spreadsheet to mark this objective as 'complete' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily favors the status quo for several compelling reasons. First, the timeline is extremely compressed at just 48 days. Second, the research assistant's report describes a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee process that actually extends BEYOND the July 1 deadline - the first session begins June 30 and proposed/final rules are expected 'later in 2025.' Critically, the committee's stated purpose is to 'refine the definition of qualifying employers' rather than terminate the program entirely, suggesting modification rather than elimination. Complete termination of a major federal program typically requires either Congressional legislation (virtually impossible in 48 days), executive action (possible but would face immediate legal challenges and implementation hurdles), or completed rulemaking (which the timeline shows won't finish by July 1). The objective is currently marked 'in progress,' indicating some action has occurred but completion is not imminent. For the tracker maintainers to mark this as 'complete,' they would need to see formal, finalized termination - not merely proposals, committee formation, or ongoing restrictions. My forecast is not lower (below 5%) because there remains a small possibility of a dramatic executive action that immediately halts all PSLF operations, though even then the distinction between 'halted' and 'terminated' matters. My forecast is not higher because the described rulemaking timeline, the focus on refinement rather than termination, and the compressed timeframe all strongly suggest this will remain incomplete by July 1. I would update higher only with evidence of imminent executive orders specifically terminating the program, or update lower with any official statements affirming the program's continuation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. Department of Education is establishing a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee, named the Student Loans and Affordability Committee, tasked with developing proposed regulations for federal student aid programs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
