    "review": "The other two forecasters' analyses strongly align with my own, creating a solid consensus. We all identify the same key drivers for a likely 'No' outcome: the gradualist platform of the newly elected government, the extremely short timeframe before the deadline, the economic dependence on Denmark, and the establishment of a multi-year commission to handle the process. These factors create a powerful inertia against any sudden moves. Forecaster 2 effectively structured these points, and Forecaster 3 introduced a particularly insightful nuance that I had not fully articulated: the most plausible 'Yes' scenario is not a rush to an imminent vote, but a symbolic political gesture of announcing a referendum for a date far in the future. This would satisfy the resolution criteria while allowing the government to maintain its long-term economic focus. This is a crucial point because it defines the specific, low-probability event we are forecasting.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. The deliberation has not uncovered new evidence pointing to a higher probability but has reinforced the initial reasoning and clarified the most likely, albeit remote, path to a 'Yes' outcome. The consensus is that the new government's core strategy, which won them the recent election, is fundamentally at odds with scheduling a referendum in the next seven weeks. While I agree with Forecaster 3 that announcing a vote for a distant date (e.g., 2035) is the most plausible way a 'Yes' could occur, I believe the probability of this happening so soon after the election is very low. The government has a fresh mandate for a cautious approach and has already established a formal, multi-year commission as its chosen vehicle for the independence process. Announcing a date now would preempt their own commission's work and appear reactive to opposition pressure, something a new government is unlikely to do without a significant triggering event. The arguments for 'No' remain overwhelming, and the 'Yes' scenarios remain in the realm of low-probability political maneuvering.",
