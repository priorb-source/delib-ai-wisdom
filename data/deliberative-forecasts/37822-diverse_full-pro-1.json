    "review": "My initial forecast of 60% was significantly higher than the other two forecasters, who both landed at 30%. Their analyses have persuaded me that my initial assessment was too high. Both forecasters correctly placed more weight than I did on the current status quo: with only about 40 days until the deadline, there is a complete lack of visible campaign preparation (no FEC filing, no staff hires, no exploratory committee). I had weighted O'Rourke's historical announcement timelines more heavily, but they convinced me that the absence of concurrent, on-the-ground evidence is a stronger negative signal. Forecaster 2's interpretation of O'Rourke's conditional language ('if Texans want me to') as a sign of genuine indecision, rather than purely strategic pre-announcement positioning, is also a valid point I had not fully considered. The most significant new piece of evidence was raised by Forecaster 3: the June 30th FEC quarterly fundraising deadline. This provides a powerful, structural incentive for a candidate to announce in June to be able to post a strong initial fundraising number. This is the strongest argument in favor of a 'Yes' resolution and prevents me from dropping my forecast to their level of 30%. I find their overall caution more compelling than my initial optimism, but I believe the specific incentive of the Q2 deadline makes a pre-July 1 announcement more likely than they credit.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 60% to 40%. I was initially too focused on the historical precedent of O'Rourke's announcement timelines (~12-20 months pre-election), which aligns well with the July 1, 2025 deadline. However, the other forecasters rightly emphasized the profound lack of any observable pre-campaign activity. A major statewide campaign launch requires significant logistical groundwork, and the total absence of any reporting or leaks about staff hires or other preparations is a powerful signal that an announcement in the next 40 days is not the base case. Despite this, I believe 30% is slightly too low due to the crucial point raised by Forecaster 3: the June 30th FEC fundraising deadline. This acts as a strong 'forcing function,' providing a specific, strategic reason for O'Rourke to announce in June if he intends to run. It allows a campaign to capture early enthusiasm and post an impressive initial fundraising total to demonstrate viability. My updated forecast of 40% balances the powerful negative signal of current inactivity against the strong positive signal of the Q2 fundraising incentive. I now see this as a 'more likely than not No' scenario, but with the FEC deadline creating a very real possibility of a June launch that keeps the probability from falling too low.",
