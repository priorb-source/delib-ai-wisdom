  "information": "In early April 2025, the U.S. administration announced a new trade policy based on 'reciprocal tariffs,' effectively ending the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) which had allowed many African countries to export goods to the U.S. duty-free. The new policy applies tariffs to approximately 185 countries. The tariff rates are determined by a formula that involves dividing a country's bilateral trade deficit with the U.S. by the amount of U.S. imports from that country, and then dividing the result by two. This policy resulted in varying tariff rates, including 50% for Lesotho and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, 49% for Cambodia, 46% for Vietnam, 34% for China, and 20% for the European Union. The new tariffs took effect on April 9, 2025, although the U.S. later announced a 90-day pause on introducing new tariffs for some countries, a move not extended to Lesotho.\n\nThe U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Lesotho due to a significant trade imbalance; in 2024, Lesotho exported approximately $237-240 million worth of goods to the U.S., while importing only about $2.8-3 million from the U.S. The tariff is expected to severely impact Lesotho's economy, particularly its textile and apparel industry, which employs around 40,000 workers and constitutes about 90% of the country's manufacturing employment and exports. In response to the tariff, the Lesotho government announced on April 3, 2025, that it was forming a high-level delegation to travel to Washington to negotiate with U.S. authorities and seek clarification on the tariff's rationale.\n\nThe imposition of new U.S. tariffs prompted various international reactions. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) began assessing the tariffs' impact on the region and planned a high-level summit for June. Within the SADC, Zimbabwe's decision to remove its own tariffs on American imports was criticized by some as undermining regional solidarity. The European Union announced it would delay its own trade countermeasures against the U.S. for 90 days to allow for negotiations. China responded by imposing its own retaliatory tariffs of 34% and filing a formal complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO).",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the HTS continues to display a +50% tariff for Lesotho (even if marked as suspended).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. carves out Lesotho (e.g., restores an exemption, reduces its rate below 50%, or removes the Lesotho-specific line) or restructures the implementation so the HTS no longer explicitly lists a 50% duty for Lesotho by June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The HTS retains an explicit Lesotho-specific provision (in the main subheadings or Chapter 99) indicating a +50% duty or additional duty for products of Lesotho, regardless of whether it’s marked as suspended.",
    "rationale": "- Summary of assistant’s report: In early April 2025, the U.S. adopted a reciprocal-tariffs policy, ending AGOA preferences and imposing country-specific tariffs via a deficit-based formula. Lesotho’s rate is 50%, effective April 9. A 90-day pause on new tariffs applied to some countries but not to Lesotho. Reactions include EU delaying countermeasures 90 days and China retaliating. Lesotho plans to send a delegation to Washington.  - Status quo weight: The policy is already in effect and, per the report, not paused for Lesotho. With only ~5–6 weeks until June 1, the path of least resistance is that the HTS continues to list a 50% tariff for Lesotho. - Resolution nuances: The criterion hinges on what the HTS shows, not whether the duty is active. The prompt explicitly says a suspended listing still counts. That reduces downside risk from injunctions or administrative pauses, provided the 50% line remains visible on HTS. - Key risks to a No outcome: (1) A targeted carve-out for Lesotho (e.g., humanitarian/LDC exemption or AGOA-like restoration), (2) a broader policy adjustment extending the pause to all countries including Lesotho, or (3) HTS presentation changes that remove explicit country mentions (e.g., moving to a generic mechanistic rule without listing “Lesotho” by name). The last is a nontrivial technical risk given how the HTS often implements additional duties via Chapter 99, but the policy appears country-specific and publicly enumerated, increasing the odds “Lesotho” remains explicitly listed. - Why not higher: There is real political/legal pressure against sweeping tariffs; a narrowly tailored exemption for small LDCs like Lesotho or a late-breaking policy adjustment could arrive before June 1. There’s also some implementation risk around whether the HTS displays an explicit “Lesotho 50%” entry searchable/visible at the time Metaculus checks. - Why not lower: The measure is already in force for Lesotho, the window is short, and the stated 90-day pauses do not cover Lesotho. Even if litigation or diplomacy advances, a suspended listing still resolves Yes. - What would move me up: USITC/HTS revisions reaffirming country-by-country listings that explicitly include “Lesotho 50%,” CBP/CSMS notices confirming continued application to Lesotho through June, or signals that any pauses/exemptions explicitly exclude Lesotho. - What would move me down: Credible reports of a carve-out for LDCs/Lesotho, an extension of the 90-day pause to Lesotho before June 1, or an HTS update that removes or obfuscates country-specific listings such that “Lesotho 50%” is no longer shown.",
