  "information": "A Russian delegation is scheduled to visit Istanbul on June 2, 2025, for a second round of peace talks with Ukraine. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitriy Peskov stated that a high-level summit involving President Trump would depend on the achievement of results from these direct talks between the two delegations. Russia proposed the June 2 date, following a previous meeting on May 16. The United States will not send an official delegation, but White House press secretary Caroline Levitt said, 'We will let you know if the President has plans to send a representative.'\n\nIn February 2025, there was media speculation, particularly from French sources, about a potential visit by Donald Trump to Moscow for the Victory Day celebrations on May 9, 2025. Former Russian Prime Minister Sergey Stepanov commented at the time that such a visit would be a 'big sensation.' On February 12, 2025, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a 1.5-hour phone call during which they agreed to a personal meeting and extended mutual invitations to Washington and Moscow. The speculated May 9 visit did not occur.\n\nIn late May 2025, following a major Russian drone and missile attack in Ukraine, President Donald Trump referred to President Vladimir Putin as 'absolutely crazy.' In a separate statement, Trump also expressed his disappointment with Putin's continued attacks, saying, 'I am very disappointed, very, very disappointed.' Trump indicated he would observe Russia's intentions over a two-week period to determine if they were genuine about achieving peace.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "One month. The resolution window for the visit to occur closes on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. There are no publicly announced plans for President Trump to visit Russia. High-level international visits, particularly to a nation involved in a major conflict, require extensive logistical and security preparations which are not currently underway.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The peace talks scheduled for June 2 in Istanbul fail to produce a significant breakthrough, or they make only incremental progress. Given the lack of a major diplomatic victory to celebrate and the extremely short timeline for logistical and security planning, no visit is scheduled. President Trump's recent critical remarks about President Putin also contribute to a diplomatic climate where a visit is deemed inappropriate or untimely. The July 1 deadline passes without a visit.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The peace talks in Istanbul on June 2 result in a spectacular and unexpected breakthrough, such as a full ceasefire agreement. To seize the political momentum and personally preside over a historic peace accord, President Trump engages in unconventional, rapid-fire diplomacy. A hasty but functional summit is arranged in Moscow for late June, where he meets President Putin to sign the agreement.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly weighted towards 'No'. The primary factor is the extremely compressed timeline. As of May 30, there is only one month left for a potential visit to occur. Presidential trips of this magnitude, especially to a geopolitical adversary like Russia, are complex logistical and security operations that are typically planned months in advance. The current status quo is that no such preparations are in motion. \n\nThe Kremlin itself has publicly stated that a potential high-level summit is contingent on 'the achievement of results' from the June 2 peace talks. This creates a dependency where even the consideration of a visit cannot begin until after that date, leaving less than four weeks for planning and execution, which is highly improbable. \n\nFurthermore, President Trump's recent rhetoric, calling President Putin 'absolutely crazy' and expressing 'very, very disappointed' sentiments, creates a poor diplomatic atmosphere for an imminent visit. While diplomatic tones can shift, these strong statements make a friendly summit in the immediate future politically awkward and less likely. \n\nThe probability is not zero because of President Trump's history of unconventional diplomatic approaches and the small but non-zero chance of a sudden breakthrough in Ukraine peace talks that both leaders might want to seal with a high-profile meeting. A historic peace treaty could provide sufficient political motivation to overcome the logistical hurdles. \n\nThe probability is not higher because the combined obstacles of the short timeline, the contingent nature of the talks, immense security challenges, and the recent negative rhetoric create a formidable barrier to a visit occurring. For my forecast to move higher, we would need to see an immediate and widely-hailed breakthrough on June 2, followed by a joint announcement from both Washington and Moscow about an expedited summit. Conversely, my forecast would move lower if the talks on June 2 fail or if the middle of June passes with no announcements.",
