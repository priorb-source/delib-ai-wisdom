  "information": "Historical changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are infrequent. In February 2024, Intel and Walgreens were replaced. In August 2020, Exxon Mobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies were replaced by Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell. In June 2018, General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, and in March 2015, AT&T was replaced by Apple.\n\nSeveral DJIA components have experienced recent negative performance and events. UnitedHealth Group's stock dropped 22%, causing a record 805-point single-stock decline in the DJIA. In March 2025, Nike's stock dropped 20.1%, Walt Disney's fell 13.3%, and Nvidia's declined 13.2%. IBM shares fell 7.6% after the company announced the cancellation of 15 government contracts. IBM (-6.6%) and Procter & Gamble (-3.7%) have also experienced recent losses.\n\nThe broader US stock market is experiencing significant volatility driven by corporate earnings, trade policy uncertainty, and economic indicators. President Trump's tariffs sparked a 2,200-point drop in the DJIA on April 4, 2025. In response to the impact of tariffs, Deutsche Bank strategists cut their year-end S&P 500 target by 12%. The Federal Reserve is described as cautious due to persistent inflation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from April 25, 2025, to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No companies listed in the question will be announced for removal from the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The S&P Dow Jones Indices' Averages Committee views the recent market volatility and specific stock downturns as short-term fluctuations. Given that changes were made as recently as February 2024, the committee takes no action and makes no announcements regarding the index's composition before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to significant market turmoil and the sustained, severe underperformance of a major component like UnitedHealth Group or another company like Nike or IBM, the Averages Committee acts to ensure the index remains representative of the U.S. economy. An official announcement is made in May or June 2025 that one of the listed companies will be dropped from the DJIA.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the tension between the historical infrequency of DJIA changes and the current high-volatility market environment described in the research report. The primary factor supporting a 'No' outcome is the short, two-month time period and the fact that changes were last made in February 2024. The Averages Committee typically acts deliberately and avoids reacting to short-term market noise. Historically, changes occur every few years, not every few months, making the status quo of no change highly probable.\n\nHowever, the probability is not lower because the provided context describes a market with significant catalysts for change. The fictional 2,200-point DJIA drop, coupled with severe, specific stock declines for components like UnitedHealth (-22%), Nike (-20.1%), and IBM (-7.6% after contract cancellations), creates a plausible trigger for the committee to act sooner than usual. Such dramatic shifts can accelerate decisions to ensure the index's integrity and relevance. The 2020 changes, spurred by an Apple stock split, show the committee can be reactive to specific market events.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because, despite the turmoil, committee inertia is a powerful force. Two months is a very short window for the committee to deliberate and make a public announcement. They would likely want to see if the recent market events are a temporary shock or the beginning of a long-term trend before making a decision with such significant implications.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible rumors of an imminent committee meeting emerged or if one of the struggling companies experienced another major negative event. I would decrease it if the market stabilized and the underperforming stocks began to recover in the coming weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are infrequent.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
