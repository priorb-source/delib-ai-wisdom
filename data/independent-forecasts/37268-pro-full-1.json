  "information": "As of early May 2025, Muqtada al-Sadr has publicly and repeatedly reaffirmed his boycott of the 2025 Iraqi parliamentary election. In April 2025, he rejected a plea from the Iraqi President to reconsider his decision, stating he would not participate with 'the corrupt'. In March 2025, he forbade his followers from voting or participating in the election. A Qatari report from late April indicated al-Sadr is unwilling to take responsibility for the political mistakes of the rival Shia Coordination Framework. During a speech on May 2, 2025, he told supporters to 'speak out if their speech benefits reform, and remain silent if silence benefits reform.'\n\nThe Iraqi government has set November 11, 2025, as the date for the parliamentary elections. The Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) announced that the registration period for political alliances would run from April 15 to May 4, 2025. The political landscape is marked by significant divisions within the Shia bloc. The Shiite Coordination Framework, a major coalition, plans to participate in the election with at least six separate lists, though they are in discussions to form a post-election coalition. The electoral law remains a point of contention among political blocs.\n\nMuqtada al-Sadr has a history of reversing decisions to boycott elections. He previously reversed boycotts in 2014 and 2021. The 2021 reversal occurred in mid-August, approximately two months before the election. Despite his current boycott, al-Sadr has urged his followers to update their voter registration records. Some political sources have discussed the possibility of al-Sadr participating indirectly through an independent list to maintain influence, a strategy he has used in the past. In June 2022, after his party won 73 seats in the 2021 election, he ordered his entire parliamentary bloc to resign.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, as the question deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Alliance Towards Reforms party will maintain its declared boycott and will not announce its participation in the election before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Muqtada al-Sadr adheres to his repeated public statements and continues his boycott of the electoral process, citing the presence of 'corrupt' political rivals. The deadline for registering political alliances passes without the Sadrists, and no announcement of participation is made before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following intense back-channel negotiations, al-Sadr perceives a significant political opening or receives major concessions from his rivals regarding the electoral law or future government posts. He frames this as a victory for 'reform' and, in a characteristic reversal similar to 2014 and 2021, announces in late June that his alliance will participate in the election to prevent his opponents from dominating the state.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 25% is based on a conflict between Muqtada al-Sadr's current firm stance and his well-established history of political reversals. The factors supporting a 'No' outcome are currently stronger for the specific timeframe of this question.\n\nThe primary evidence for 'No' is al-Sadr's recent and repeated public affirmations of the boycott. In April 2025, he explicitly rejected a plea from the Iraqi President, and in March, he forbade his followers from participating. This strong public posture establishes a high political cost to reversal. Furthermore, the official registration period for political alliances was set to close on May 4, 2025. Announcing participation after this date, but before the question's July 1 deadline, would be procedurally difficult and require special accommodation, making it less likely.\n\nThe primary evidence for 'Yes' is al-Sadr's history of U-turns. He has reversed previous election boycotts, notably in 2014 and 2021. The 2021 reversal occurred in August, roughly two months before the election. This pattern shows that he uses boycotts as a tactical maneuver to gain leverage. His call for followers to update their voter registration also keeps the door open for participation.\n\nMy probability is not lower because his history of reversals is a significant factor; his decisions are often unpredictable and tactical. A sudden political shift or a deal with his rivals could easily trigger another reversal.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the timeline is tight. The July 1 deadline for this question may be too early for al-Sadr's typical brinkmanship. His 2021 reversal was in August, which would be after this question closes. Given the very recent and forceful reaffirmation of the boycott and the logistical hurdle of the registration deadline, the status quo of non-participation is the most probable outcome within the next two months.",
