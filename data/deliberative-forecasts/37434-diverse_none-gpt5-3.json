    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds concrete, decision-relevant details I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: YE2024 cash of ~$1.5M, ~$23M annual operating cash burn, an auditor going-concern warning, and—crucially—a signed purchase and sale agreement for the Indiana farm expected to close in Q2 2025. If accurate (and consistent with the linked 3/27/25 results), that sharply increases near-term hazard but also provides a clear path to avoiding bankruptcy if the deal closes on time. I agree with their single-point-of-failure framing but think 65% is somewhat high because even if the closing slips, micro-caps often secure short bridge capital (ATM usage, deposits/advance from buyer, vendor stretch, or a small secured loan against proceeds) that can punt a filing past July 1. \n\nForecaster 3 leans heavily on status-quo/base-rate arguments and the recency of the FY results filing. I find that less convincing given the specific (and acute) liquidity picture: companies with going-concern flags and minimal cash can and do file within weeks if a lifeline fails. Filing timely financials does not preclude imminent insolvency. Their 15% seems too low in light of the reported cash/burn dynamics and dependency on a single transaction within our window.",
    "rationale": "With ~8 weeks left, the question pivots on whether the Indiana farm sale closes by June 30 and whether AquaBounty can bridge to that point. The signed PSA meaningfully reduces risk of non-close, but short-dated closings can slip. If YE2024 cash was ~$1.5M and burn was historically high, runway is thin without extraordinary cost cuts or interim funds. My base structure:\n- Probability of close by June 30 on schedule: roughly 60–70% given a signed PSA and management guidance.\n- Probability of a delay/push or failure before June 30: roughly 30–40%.\n- Conditional on delay/failure, probability of a bankruptcy filing before July 1: high but not certain—around 60–80%—because a small bridge (ATM, deposit, vendor deferral, buyer pre-close support, or secured bridge against proceeds) could defer a filing beyond the resolution date.\n- A smaller pathway exists where management opts for an in-court 363 sale even with a buyer lined up; I’d assign a modest 5–10% to that independent of delay.\n\nCombining these, I arrive in the low-to-mid 40s: higher than my prior 34% due to the specific liquidity stress and single-transaction dependency, but lower than 65% because bridges are common and a signed PSA materially de-risks timing. I would move up quickly on any 8-K indicating the sale is delayed, buyer financing uncertainty, or statements about cash insufficiency before June; I would move down sharply on confirmation of closing funds received or credible interim financing.",
