    "review": "New and useful points from the other forecasters: (1) the May 10 DGMO-brokered ceasefire and reported withdrawals toward end-May (I hadn’t factored that in) are strong de-escalation signals; (2) the definitional constraint that BSF fires wouldn’t count (must be Army/Air Force/Navy) plus the risk that covert actions won’t be credibly attributable for resolution; (3) patterning after punitive actions—international pressure usually pushes a pause; (4) claims that “Operation Sindoor/Sundar” may already have included Pakistan-proper strikes in April/May, which raises willingness but also suggests Delhi may feel it’s already reestablished deterrence and will now consolidate. I find Forecaster 3’s emphasis on the ceasefire and narrow qualifying geography persuasive, and I agree with Forecaster 2’s caution that attribution and service-branch issues lower the path to a Yes. I’m less convinced by F2’s 30%—that seems high without a fresh trigger and given the ceasefire context.",
    "rationale": "My prior 15% leaned on heightened rhetoric, diplomatic shaping, and reported delegation of retaliatory authority to Western Command. Incorporating the added evidence: a formal ceasefire on May 10 with planned pullbacks lowers the near-term hazard rate; the most common kinetic activity occurs on the LoC into AJK/GB (excluded); and even if cross-border firing occurs along the IB, it’s often BSF-led (non-qualifying) unless the Army/Air Force is clearly involved. The claim of earlier Pakistan-proper strikes in late April/early May cuts both ways—proves capability/willingness, but also makes additional June strikes less necessary absent a major provocation. Given a one-month window and the need for a new trigger (mass-casualty terror attack with attribution, significant Pakistani kinetic action into India, or clear Indian force posturing for cross-border strikes), I modestly revise down. I would move up quickly on: credible reports of a major attack in India traced to Pakistan-based groups; visible IAF posture changes (NOTAMs, CAP surges, dispersal), CCS meetings signaling imminent action; breakdown of the ceasefire specifically along the IB/Working Boundary in Punjab/Sindh with Army involvement. I would move down further if mutual withdrawals complete quietly by end-May and ceasefire reaffirmations persist into mid-June.",
