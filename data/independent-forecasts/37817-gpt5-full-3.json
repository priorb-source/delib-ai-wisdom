  "information": "United Airlines has announced a new year-round, twice-weekly direct flight from Narita, Japan, to Koror, Palau, which will commence on October 29, 2025. The route will be operated by a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, and tickets are already available for purchase. Separately, in February 2025, Qantas launched a new direct route from Brisbane to Koror, named the 'Palau Paradise Express.' This service is supported by the Australian Government.\n\nAs of early 2024, there were four to five regularly scheduled direct flight destinations from Koror, including Guam (operated by United Airlines), Manila (United Airlines), Taipei (China Airlines), and Brisbane (Qantas). In addition to scheduled services, Japan Airlines (JAL) resumed direct charter flights from Narita to Palau in March 2025 after a five-year suspension.\n\nTourism in Palau is in a recovery phase. Visitor numbers from Europe reached 3,442 by December 2024, approaching pre-pandemic levels. The Palau Visitors Authority is promoting the destination by leveraging increased flight frequency with partners like China Airlines. Hong Kong Airlines also lists Koror as a destination within its network. Prior to the pandemic, several South Korean airlines, including Air Seoul and T'way, operated services to Palau. A previous service between Narita and Koror operated by Delta Air Lines was suspended in May 2018.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~6 weeks until July 1, 2025 (Metaculus may check any time on or after that date)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the tracker currently shows roughly 4–5 direct destinations, below the >5 threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By early July 2025, flightsfrom.com/ROR lists Guam, Manila, Taipei, and Brisbane (and possibly one more), but no additional scheduled destinations are visible (e.g., Tokyo–Narita not yet shown on the page, and no resumed Seoul/Hong Kong/Yap service), so total remains ≤5",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On/after July 1, 2025, the page lists at least six destinations, for example Guam, Manila, Taipei, Brisbane, Tokyo–Narita (United’s Oct 29, 2025 start already displayed as a scheduled route), plus at least one of: a resumed Seoul service, a scheduled Hong Kong service, or a reinstated Yap link",
    "rationale": "What I’m weighing:\n- Status quo: Palau remains a small, demand-constrained market. As of early 2024 there were 4–5 scheduled direct destinations (Guam, Manila, Taipei, Brisbane). Charters (e.g., JAL Narita–Palau) typically aren’t listed on flightsfrom because they’re not scheduled services. This points to ≤5 as the default in early July.\n- Known additions: United has announced Narita–Koror starting Oct 29, 2025 (tickets on sale). Qantas launched Brisbane–Koror in Feb 2025. The Narita route could appear on flightsfrom before service begins (they usually list scheduled future routes), which would likely bring the count to 5 if it’s displayed by early July.\n- What’s needed for “Yes”: To exceed 5, there must be at least two additional listed destinations vs the long-standing core. One likely candidate is Tokyo–Narita (scheduled for Oct, but possibly shown on the page by July). A second would need to materialize, such as: (a) a resumed South Korea service (ICN), (b) a scheduled Hong Kong service, or (c) a reinstated Yap link if United is operating ROR–YAP nonstops again. None of these are confirmed in the assistant’s report; HKG and ICN are plausible but speculative near-term.\n- Timing nuance: Metaculus can check any time on or after July 1. If they check immediately in early July, it’s harder to clear >5. If they check later (e.g., after Narita service becomes prominent on the page and if another route is added for late 2025), the odds improve. Still, relying on both Narita being listed and another unannounced route appearing is a stretch within 2025 given demand constraints.\nWhy not higher: Achieving >5 requires two increments from a low base. We have one credible increment (Narita listing), but a second is uncertain. South Korea demand has been slow to return; Hong Kong service is unconfirmed; charters don’t count.\nWhy not lower: Narita is announced and ticketed; flightsfrom often lists such future routes. There is some upside optionality (a resumed ICN or HKG, or a Yap link reappearing). Australian government support of the Qantas route signals momentum, and Palau tourism is recovering from a low base.\nWhat would change my view:\n- Upward: Concrete schedules loaded to GDS and visible on flightsfrom for ICN, HKG, YAP, or any other new destination; confirmation that UA’s NRT already appears on the page by early July; any additional Australia/Japan city added.\n- Downward: Evidence that UA’s NRT isn’t listed on flightsfrom by July, or the route is delayed/canceled; Qantas curtails Brisbane; confirmation that flightsfrom only counts currently operating-month routes (excluding future seasonal listings) at check time.",
