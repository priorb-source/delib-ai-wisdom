    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no player will have a .400 batting average on July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Players who started the season hot continue the typical pattern of regression to the mean. By July 1st, with 80-85 games played (roughly half the season), even the best hitters have batting averages in the .340-.380 range, which would be excellent but below the .400 threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An elite hitter like Aaron Judge, Juan Soto, or another superstar has an exceptional first half of the season and maintains a batting average at or above .400 through the first 80-85 games. This would require maintaining roughly 160+ hits in 400 at-bats, an extraordinary feat of consistency.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Maintaining a .400 batting average through early July (approximately half a season) is exceptionally rare in baseball history. The last player to finish an entire season above .400 was Ted Williams in 1941. While it's not uncommon for players to have .400+ averages in April when sample sizes are small (100-120 at-bats), maintaining this through early July with 250-350 at-bats is dramatically more difficult due to natural regression to the mean. The reference article mentions Aaron Judge having a .400 average at some point, which likely refers to an early-season hot streak. By July 1st, teams will have played roughly 80-85 games out of 162. At this point, statistical variance decreases and true talent levels become more apparent. Even the best modern hitters typically have season-ending averages in the .300-.370 range. Since we're already at May 20th (roughly 40 games into the season), we're about halfway to the resolution date. If no player is currently at or very near .400, the probability decreases further. My forecast is not higher because: (1) historical data shows extreme rarity of .400 averages past early season, (2) regression to mean is a powerful force over 80+ games, and (3) we're already partway through the period in question. My forecast is not lower because: (1) we're not asking about a full season, just through July 1st, (2) there's always some non-zero probability of exceptional performance, and (3) elite players can have sustained hot streaks. To update higher, I'd need evidence that one or more players are currently at or very near .400. To update lower, I'd need current data showing no players are even close (e.g., all below .380).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
