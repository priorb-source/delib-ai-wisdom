  "information": "On May 2, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly denied a Politico report that the administration was considering lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, calling the claim 'unequivocally false.' Both Rubio and U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum are reported to be opponents of the idea. Furthermore, reports from May 5, 2025, indicated that President Trump is considering a bipartisan bill that would impose 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian energy and expand existing sanctions.\n\nA Politico report from April 24, 2025, citing multiple sources, claimed the White House was discussing the possibility of lifting sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as part of negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine. The report stated that U.S. Special Envoy Steve Wietkoff was the main proponent of the initiative and had instructed his team to compile a list of all energy sanctions imposed on Russia. Other reports have mentioned proposals from American investors and the former CEO of Nord Stream 2 AG to restart the pipeline with U.S. participation.\n\nThe European Union has expressed a lack of interest in restoring the pipeline's operation, and is reportedly preparing new sanctions against Russia. Nord Stream 2 AG has also faced legal and financial setbacks in Europe. In April 2025, a German court upheld a bank's decision to terminate the company's accounts due to U.S. sanctions risks. The company is operating under a moratorium on bankruptcy in Switzerland and has been making payments to small creditors to facilitate a larger financial settlement. One of the two pipeline strings was severely damaged in an attack in September 2022.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until Metaculus checks on/after July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Nord Stream 2 AG remains on OFAC’s SDN list on July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration maintains or tightens Russia sanctions amid ongoing war; State and Treasury oppose delisting; Congress pushes additional sanctions/penalties (e.g., tariffs on importers of Russian energy); EU shows no appetite to revive Nord Stream; Nord Stream 2 AG remains insolvent/encumbered in Europe. OFAC takes no action, so NS2 AG still appears on the SDN list in July.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid Ukraine ceasefire/settlement framework emerges and the White House delivers a symbolic concession by delisting Nord Stream 2 AG, calculating minimal practical impact given the pipeline’s damage and Europe’s stance. Treasury/OFAC issues a delisting notice in late June as part of a broader sanctions reconfiguration, so the SDN entry no longer appears by July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: Nord Stream 2 AG is currently sanctioned and listed by OFAC. With less than two months until the resolution date, the default is that it stays listed. Good forecasting practice gives extra weight to the status quo, especially on politically salient sanctions where reversals are rare and costly absent a clear trigger.\n- Recent signals (from research assistant): On May 2, 2025, Sec. State Rubio called reports of lifting sanctions “unequivocally false,” and Interior Sec. Burgum is also opposed. On May 5, reporting indicated President Trump is considering a bipartisan bill to impose 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian energy and to expand sanctions—both pointing to a more hawkish posture, not imminent relief. The EU shows no interest in reviving Nord Stream and is preparing new sanctions. Nord Stream 2 AG faces legal/financial headwinds (German court upholding account terminations; Swiss moratorium; partial creditor payments), and one pipeline string is badly damaged. All of this reduces the incentive to delist quickly.\n- Contrary evidence: Politico (Apr 24) reported internal White House discussions, with Special Envoy Steve Wietkoff pushing to catalog energy sanctions and consider lifting in the context of Ukraine negotiations. There are also proposals from investors/ex-CEO to restart with U.S. participation. These suggest a non-zero probability of policy fluidity and that delisting could be a low-cost bargaining chip.\n- Why not higher: Public, on-the-record denial by Rubio; domestic political costs of easing Russia sanctions; EU disinterest; lack of clear, imminent diplomatic deal; and very short timeline to July 1. Congress may be moving toward tougher measures, raising the political price of relief.\n- Why not lower: The administration can, in principle, delist quickly via OFAC notice if folded into a diplomatic package. NS2’s physical damage and Europe’s stance make delisting a largely symbolic concession—precisely the kind sometimes used to grease negotiations. Prior precedent (e.g., the 2021 waiver episode under a different administration) shows policy toward NS2 can shift rapidly when political conditions favor it.\n- What would move me up: Credible, on-record indications from Treasury/White House tying NS2 delisting to a Ukraine ceasefire framework; leaks of a draft sanctions-relief package; EU signaling support/tolerance; or an official OFAC de-listing action pending. \n- What would move me down: Passage or near-passage of new Russia energy sanctions/tariffs; additional strong denials from State/Treasury; EU escalation of sanctions; new Russian escalation prompting tighter U.S. sanctions.\nOverall, given the short window and current political signals, a delisting before July 1 looks unlikely but not impossible.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 2, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly denied a Politico report that the administration was considering lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, calling the claim 'unequivocally false.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
