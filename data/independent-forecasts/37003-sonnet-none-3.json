    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months. The 2025 Viennese state election is expected to be held in late October or early November 2025, following the pattern of previous Vienna elections (2020, 2015).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) wins the most seats. The SPÖ has governed Vienna continuously since 1945 and won the most seats in every post-WWII Vienna election, including 46 out of 100 seats in 2020.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) capitalizes on broader national trends and anti-incumbent sentiment to surge past the SPÖ. Given FPÖ's strong performance in recent Austrian national elections and their traditional strength as an opposition party, they could mobilize voters dissatisfied with long-term SPÖ governance in Vienna.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The SPÖ maintains its traditional dominance in Vienna, which remains Austria's most left-leaning region. Despite some erosion of support, the party's strong local organization, incumbent advantage with Mayor Michael Ludwig, and Vienna's demographic composition (urban, diverse, younger) preserve their plurality position even if their vote share declines from 2020 levels.",
    "rationale": "Vienna represents one of the SPÖ's strongest bastions, with uninterrupted governance since 1945. The city's political culture differs significantly from rural Austria, being more socially liberal and urban. However, several factors introduce uncertainty: (1) Recent Austrian politics has seen significant FPÖ gains nationally; (2) Long-term incumbency can breed voter fatigue; (3) The poll reference from March 2025 suggests active monitoring of potentially competitive dynamics. The status quo strongly favors the SPÖ winning the most seats - this is the overwhelming historical baseline. For my forecast to move higher (toward 85-90%), I would need to see polling showing SPÖ with a comfortable 10+ point lead over the second-place party. For it to move lower (toward 50-60%), I would need evidence of FPÖ or another party polling within 2-3 points of SPÖ, or signs of major SPÖ-specific scandals or leadership problems. Without access to the specific poll numbers mentioned, I weight heavily toward the historical baseline while acknowledging meaningful uncertainty given broader Austrian political trends.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Social Democratic Party of Austria win the most seats in the 2025 Viennese state election?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee for example election polls at [Vienna: Poll by IFDD from 24.03.2025](https://politpro.eu/en/austria/polls/63413/ifdd/2025-03-24)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Social Democratic Party of Austria wins a plurality of seats in the [2025 Viennese state election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Viennese_state_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
