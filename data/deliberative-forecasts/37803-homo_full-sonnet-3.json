    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly between 7-10%, suggesting strong consensus on the base case. Forecasters 2 and 3 raised an interesting point I hadn't explicitly considered: the possibility of technical or operational restoration without representing a policy shift - essentially, the site could be restored for practical military reasons (base planning, infrastructure needs) even while the administration maintains its rhetorical stance against climate programs. This is a valid scenario that adds incremental probability. However, I find this argument somewhat weak given the administration's consistent and emphatic messaging. Restoring climate.mil would be politically awkward and create mixed signals that contradict Hegseth's explicit statements. The site's takedown was deliberate and part of a coordinated federal website purge, not merely incidental. All three of us correctly identified the key constraints: 4 months already offline, 42-day timeframe, explicit policy statements backed by concrete funding cuts and program rescissions, and historical precedent from 2017-2021. The Congressional hearings represent symbolic rather than binding pressure. Our forecasts converge because the evidence overwhelmingly points in one direction.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I maintain that the status quo strongly favors the site remaining offline. The 'technical restoration' scenario they highlighted adds perhaps 1% of additional probability, but it's counterbalanced by the administration's emphatic consistency across policy statements, funding decisions, and program eliminations. The 42-day timeframe remains critically constraining - bureaucratic action typically moves slowly, and there's zero indication of restoration plans despite 4+ months offline. Historical precedent from 2017-2021 strongly suggests multi-year downtime for similar sites. The Congressional hearings lack enforcement mechanisms and face significant political headwinds. For me to update meaningfully higher, I would need to see: actual restoration announcements, legal mandates issued, or signals of policy reconsideration. None of these exist. The tight clustering of our forecasts (7-10%, mean ~8%) validates that we're in the right range, but the preponderance of evidence supports the lower end.",
