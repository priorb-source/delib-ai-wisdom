    "review": "Forecaster 2 presents the most critical evidence I completely overlooked: actual historical data showing Ukraine's inflation progressed from 12.9% (January) to 13.4% (February) to 14.6% (March). This is real, published data - not projections. We're already only 0.4 percentage points from the 15% threshold with clear upward momentum. Forecaster 2 also notes monthly inflation accelerated from 0.8% to 1.5%, and that March marked the highest rate since May 2023. Forecaster 3 adds valuable context about 18-19% food inflation in the Easter basket and emphasizes that we're late in April (April 22), so most price data is already determined. Both forecasters provide evidence I failed to consider in my initial analysis, which was overly focused on the NBU's year-end forecast without recognizing that an 8.7% year-end figure is entirely consistent with a Q2 peak above 15% followed by decline.",
    "rationale": "I significantly underestimated the probability in my initial forecast. The actual data trend is decisive: starting from 14.6% in March and needing only a 0.4 percentage point increase to reach 15% represents a very small gap given the clear upward momentum. Moreover, the NBU's own guidance that inflation will 'peak in Q2 2025' (which includes April) actually supports a YES outcome - they're essentially forecasting that April/May/June will see the highest inflation before summer decline. The accelerating monthly rate (1.5% in March vs 0.8% in February) and severe food inflation (17.4-19% YoY) in an economy where food is a major CPI component provide strong structural support for crossing the threshold. The fact that we're already on April 22 reduces uncertainty considerably - most of the month's price movements have already occurred. While month-to-month volatility exists and base effects could theoretically moderate the rate, the combination of proximity to threshold, clear trend, NBU's Q2 peak expectation, and late timing in the month makes a YES outcome substantially more likely than my initial 18% suggested. I'm updating to 75% to reflect the weight of evidence showing strong likelihood of crossing 15%.",
