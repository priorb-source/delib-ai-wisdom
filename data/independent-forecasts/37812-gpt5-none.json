    "status_quo_outcome": "No – Beirut’s nonstop network likely remains below 52 destinations absent a notable summer ramp-up or resumptions.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security tensions persist into late June, demand from inbound tourists remains weak, and some seasonal adds are trimmed or not loaded. MEA and regional carriers keep a concentrated network focused on Gulf, Iraq, Egypt, Turkey, and a core set of European capitals, totaling ≤51 destinations on FlightsFrom.com.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite headwinds, the July high-season schedule materializes: seasonal Mediterranean leisure routes (e.g., Antalya/Bodrum, Greek islands, Egypt resorts) plus a handful of European resumptions or additions go live, pushing FlightsFrom.com’s BEY count to 52+ around July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and inertia: With only ~6 weeks left, large network changes are unlikely. Airlines have largely set summer schedules; in the current security environment, upside surprises are rarer than cuts. I therefore overweight the status quo. \n- Threshold analysis: Exceeding 51 requires a fairly broad European slate plus extensive Gulf/Iraq/Turkey/Egypt coverage and several seasonal leisure points. Given ongoing Israel–Hezbollah tensions and weak inbound tourism, the most likely network looks mid-to-high 40s to around 50 destinations rather than comfortably above 51. \n- Seasonality vs. risk: July is peak season and could add Greek islands, Turkish resorts, and Red Sea points. However, recent reporting flags a soft summer for Lebanon’s tourism, and carriers often respond by reducing marginal seasonal routes. Security-driven last-minute suspensions are a known risk that would reduce the count on FlightsFrom.com. \n- MEA-centric reality: MEA can sustain many core links (Paris, London, FRA, Italy, Switzerland, Brussels, Vienna; Gulf hubs; Iraq; Turkey; Larnaca/Athens; Egypt). That likely yields something like 40–50 destinations. To clear 51, additional seasonal/secondary European and Mediterranean routes need to be live and visible on FlightsFrom at the check date. Given demand uncertainty, that feels less than even odds. \n- Research assistant input: No additional information available; I’m leaning on structural factors (security, demand, seasonal scheduling norms) and historical network size patterns. \n- Why not higher: The tourism slump headlines and conflict risk make marginal seasonals vulnerable; downside cancellations are more likely than multiple resumptions. \n- Why not lower: Diaspora and VFR demand typically sustain Gulf/Iraq/Turkey/Egypt plus core Europe even in rough times. July’s seasonality still offers some upside via a few leisure adds. \n- What would move me up: By mid-June, FlightsFrom.com showing ≥50 destinations, confirmed seasonal adds to Greek islands/Turkish resorts/Egypt beach airports, or news of resumptions by one or two European carriers. \n- What would move me down: Any new escalation causing widespread suspensions, NOTAMs restricting Beirut operations, or visible trimming of seasonal routes on FlightsFrom.com in late June.",
