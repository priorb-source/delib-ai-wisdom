    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Circle remains a privately-held company, as the IPO has not yet occurred.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The IPO process faces a delay. This could be due to extended SEC reviews, unfavorable market conditions causing Circle's management to postpone the listing, or an inability to secure a favorable valuation. Any such delay, even a minor one, could push the listing date past the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The company, having already filed its S-1 and navigated the bulk of the SEC review process, proceeds with its roadshow in late May or early June. Investor interest is strong, allowing Circle to price its shares and officially begin trading on the NYSE in the last two weeks of June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on interpreting the momentum suggested by the provided Forbes article within the context of the tight deadline. The current date is May 14, 2025, leaving only six weeks until the July 1 deadline. The status quo is that Circle is a private company, and IPO processes are complex with many potential points of failure, which gives significant weight to a 'No' outcome.\n\nHowever, the provided Forbes article dated April 4, 2025, makes a very strong claim: 'The Circle IPO Solidifies 2025 As The Year Of Stablecoins.' This headline suggests that the IPO is not just a distant possibility but a near-term, market-defining event that is already well underway. For such an article to be written, it is highly probable that Circle is in the final stages of the IPO process. The timeline, while aggressive, is plausible if the company has been efficiently moving through regulatory hurdles for the past several months.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 65% because of the extremely compressed timeframe. A six-week window leaves no room for error. Any minor regulatory delay, a brief market downturn, or a last-minute amendment to the S-1 filing could easily push the listing into July, causing the question to resolve as No. The inherent unpredictability of IPO timelines is the dominant risk factor.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 65% because that would involve heavily discounting the primary piece of information provided. The Forbes article acts as a strong signal of imminence and high confidence from market observers. To forecast below 50% would be to assume a significant, unforeseen issue will arise in the next six weeks, which is possible but not the most likely scenario given the available information.\n\nI would update my forecast higher upon seeing an official press release from Circle announcing a specific date for pricing or trading in June. I would update my forecast lower on news of a market-wide downturn (e.g., a VIX spike above 25), a crypto-specific crisis, or any report citing delays in Circle's SEC review process.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Circle be publicly-traded before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nForbes: [The Circle IPO Solidifies 2025 As The Year Of Stablecoins](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/04/04/the-circle-ipo-solidifies-2025-as-the-year-of-stablecoin/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if shares of Circle Internet Group, Inc. are publicly traded on New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
