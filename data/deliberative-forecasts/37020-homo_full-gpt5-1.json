    "review": "Both forecasters sharpened two points I only partially addressed: (1) correlated outcomes across categories—if voters lean traditional, a shutout is plausible despite multiple nominations; and (2) whether Malone is a credited songwriter on “I Had Some Help,” which determines if Song of the Year is a real path. Forecaster 3’s base‑rate framing (4–5 nominations anchored by a juggernaut hit usually yields at least one win) is persuasive and nudges me up. I’m not fully convinced by a 70% call given uncertainty over the exact nomination count and ACM voters’ occasional preference for core‑country credibility, but I agree Music Event/Single are strong lanes and that the Morgan Wallen co‑sign likely helps with ACM voters.",
    "rationale": "We’re ~16 days from the show; little new information is likely beyond chatter. The key is whether one of the “I Had Some Help” categories breaks Malone’s way. Music Event and Single are his best shots given the track’s commercial dominance and Wallen’s strong ACM standing. Visual Media adds a smaller path; Album of the Year feels like a long shot against entrenched country favorites. If Malone is a credited songwriter and the song is up for Song of the Year, that’s another viable route; if not, that pathway is closed. Outcomes are correlated—if voters aim to spotlight core-country acts or diversify wins, Malone could get edged out across the board. Still, multiple at‑bats tied to a blockbuster collaboration make a complete shutout less likely than not. Balancing the base‑rate case for multi‑nominees with correlated downside risk and cross‑genre headwinds, I move slightly up from my initial view but stay short of strong confidence.",
