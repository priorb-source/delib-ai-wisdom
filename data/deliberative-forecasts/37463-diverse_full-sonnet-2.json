    "review": "Both forecasters provide thoughtful analyses that align with my core reasoning. Forecaster 2 reaches the same 65% conclusion with nearly identical logic about status quo bias and the selling pattern tension. Forecaster 3 offers the most distinctive perspective at 76%, raising several compelling points I hadn't fully weighted: (1) Amazon is likely an investment lieutenant position (Combs/Weschler), which historically exhibit more inertia than Buffett's direct holdings; (2) the stake's small absolute size (~$1.9B vs $348B cash, or ~0.5%) makes it an unlikely focus for trimming; (3) critically, Berkshire's cash INCREASED while being net sellers, suggesting selective rather than desperate selling—if they're selective, why target a high-quality position like Amazon? (4) Berkshire wouldn't deliberately optimize around an arbitrary 10M threshold, so crossing it would be incidental to broader portfolio decisions. These arguments strengthen the case for stability. The counterpoint that after 10 quarters of net selling Berkshire still holds 10.7M Amazon shares actually supports the stability thesis rather than undermines it—suggesting Amazon hasn't been a primary target for reduction. However, the Q1 2025 context (no buybacks, earnings decline, explicit energy/Japan focus) still signals active portfolio reshuffling that could have included modest Amazon trimming.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, Forecaster 3's arguments about position characteristics are persuasive. The combination of (a) likely investment lieutenant management creating inertia, (b) very small position size relative to Berkshire's scale, (c) rising cash eliminating the need for Amazon-specific sales, and (d) Amazon's continued strong fundamentals makes holding above 10M more probable than I initially assessed. The fact that Berkshire maintained ~10.7M through 10 quarters of net selling suggests Amazon hasn't been a primary reduction target. While Q1 2025's conservative posture and reallocation focus remain concerning, the threshold requires only that they didn't trim MORE than 700K shares (6.5%). Given the position characteristics and historical stability, crossing this specific threshold seems less likely than I initially weighted. I'm updating upward to 70%, splitting the difference between my initial 65% and Forecaster 3's 76%. This reflects greater confidence in the inertia and selectivity arguments while maintaining some probability weight on Q1-specific selling activity.",
