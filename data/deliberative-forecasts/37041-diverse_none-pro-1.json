    "review": "The other forecasters provided excellent and convincing analysis. I found two points particularly impactful. First, Forecaster 3's clarification that we are looking for a time-bound Travel Health Notice (THN), not a change in routine vaccine recommendations, sharpens the resolution criteria. Second, both forecasters, especially Forecaster 3, identified specific ecologically vulnerable North American countries (Panama, Trinidad and Tobago) and a key early warning signal (epizootics/primate die-offs) that I had not explicitly considered. Their reasoning that the recent PAHO alert signals an elevated regional risk that could plausibly spill over into these specific areas is very persuasive. The fact that both other experts independently arrived at forecasts significantly higher than my initial one (12% and 15% vs. my 5%) is a strong signal that I was likely underweighting the new information contained in the PAHO alert and was too anchored on the historical base rate.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 5% was too heavily anchored on the strong historical base rate of no yellow fever THNs for North American countries. The other forecasters convinced me to place more weight on the recent PAHO alert from March 31, 2025. An alert signaling 'rising cases in the Americas' suggests a potentially severe yellow fever season in the region, which materially increases the short-term risk of exportation and subsequent local transmission in ecologically suitable and geographically proximate North American countries, namely Panama and Trinidad and Tobago. While the 38-day timeframe remains a significant barrier to an outbreak developing and a CDC notice being issued, it is not an insurmountable one, especially for a precautionary 'Level 1' alert if a small cluster of local transmission is confirmed. I am therefore more than doubling my forecast to align more closely with the consensus view, which I now believe better reflects the balance of probabilities. The risk is still low, but it is a non-trivial risk that my initial forecast understated.",
