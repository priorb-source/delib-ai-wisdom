  "information": "Several airlines announced the resumption or launch of new flights to Beirut for the summer 2025 season. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) is resuming service from Copenhagen and Stockholm in June. Emirates resumed its daily service from Dubai in February 2025 and added a second daily flight in April. Air France and its subsidiary Transavia also resumed flights from Paris in February. Other confirmed additions include a Wizz Air flight from Abu Dhabi starting June 4, a seasonal Middle East Airlines (MEA) route to Barcelona from June 26, and a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw beginning July 1, 2025.\n\nAccording to airport statistics, Beirut International Airport handled 1,254,550 passengers in the first quarter of 2025, a 1.42% decrease from the same period in 2024. While passenger arrivals increased by 9.33%, departures fell by 11.60%, and the number of transit passengers dropped by over 92%. The Lebanese government has also implemented new security measures at the airport to combat smuggling, including banning certain Iranian flights and increasing security checks.\n\nAs of May 2025, the number of active destinations was estimated to be around 39, based on OAG schedule data, down from 53 in May 2024. A number of airlines that suspended routes in October 2023, including British Airways, Lufthansa Group, Saudia, EgyptAir, and Pegasus, had not fully returned. Key Gulf carriers like Kuwait Airways and Qatar Airways also remained absent. Lebanon’s tourism ministry has projected that summer arrivals for 2025 will be 30% below 2019 levels.",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "By July 1, BEY lists mid-40s direct destinations on flightsfrom.com: SAS (CPH, ARN), Wizz Abu Dhabi (AUH), MEA seasonal Barcelona (BCN), and LOT (WAW) add a handful, but key Gulf and several European links (e.g., DOH, KWI, JED/RUH, CAI, SAW, some German hubs) remain absent. Any security flare-up or insurance restrictions cause further pauses, keeping the count ≤51.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid, coordinated rebound before July 1: Qatar Airways (DOH), Kuwait Airways (KWI), Saudia (JED/RUH/DMM), EgyptAir (CAI), and Pegasus (SAW) all resume; multiple MEA summer seasonals (e.g., NCE, AGP/MAD, Greek islands, Turkish resorts) plus a few European legacies (e.g., OS/LH/BA/LOT/SAS etc.) add enough unique airport destinations to push BEY’s flightsfrom.com listing to 52+.",
    "rationale": "Baseline and trajectory: The research assistant indicates about 39 active destinations in May 2025 (OAG-based), down from 53 in May 2024. That implies a sizable gap to clear the >51 threshold in roughly six weeks. Known additions into late June/July 1 include SAS (CPH, ARN), Wizz AUH (from June 4), MEA BCN (from June 26), and LOT WAW (from July 1). Emirates’ second daily and other frequency increases don’t add unique destinations. Air France/Transavia Paris service is already back and likely included in the current count.\n\nContext and headwinds:\n- Key absences: Qatar Airways (DOH), Kuwait Airways (KWI), Saudia (JED/RUH), EgyptAir (CAI), and Pegasus (SAW) reportedly remain out as of May. Their return would add multiple unique destinations, but no firm signs suggest a broad restart by July 1.\n- Demand/safety signals: Q1 2025 passengers were down slightly y/y, transit collapsed >90%, and new security measures (including bans on certain Iranian flights) point to ongoing constraints. Press coverage highlights war-related risk and weak tourism demand; Lebanon’s tourism ministry projects summer arrivals 30% below 2019.\n- Seasonality limit: Some additional summer seasonals can arrive in late June, but reaching >51 would require a double-digit net increase in unique airports. With just 6 weeks left, most such additions would already be visible in loaded schedules feeding flightsfrom.\n\nWhy put extra weight on the status quo: Good forecasts weight inertia. From ~39 now, the plausible, announced pipeline appears to lift BEY into the low-to-mid 40s by July 1. Crossing 52 requires not just a few seasonal adds but a broader regional normalization that looks unlikely on current information.\n\nWhy not higher: To exceed 51, several of the absent Gulf/nearby hubs likely need to resume plus a cluster of European/Mediterranean seasonals. There’s limited time, ongoing security uncertainty, and evidence of continued airline caution.\n\nWhy not lower: Some concrete resumptions are scheduled before July 1 (SAS, Wizz AUH, MEA BCN, LOT WAW), and MEA/others may add a few more seasonals, making a mid-40s outcome plausible rather than a further decline.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible schedule loads (OAG/flightsfrom) showing imminent resumptions to DOH, KWI, JED/RUH/DMM, CAI, SAW, plus multiple MEA/European summer seasonals (e.g., NCE, AGP/MAD, Greek islands, Turkish resorts) before July 1; or a material de-escalation/ceasefire that triggers airline returns.\n\nWhat would move me down: Fresh security incidents leading to EU/Gulf carrier suspensions; additional bans or operational constraints; visible mid-June schedules showing ≤42–44 destinations for the July 1 week on flightsfrom.com.",
