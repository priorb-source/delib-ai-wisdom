    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days from May 7, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - there is currently no confirmed evidence that the Global Protest Tracker has recorded a protest in Turkey meeting the specified criteria (10,000+ participants with a start date after question launch and before July 1, 2025)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Either no protests in Turkey reach the 10,000 participant threshold by July 1, 2025, or protests occur but the Global Protest Tracker does not record them within the timeframe, or all qualifying protests started before the question was launched",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant event triggers large-scale protests in Turkey - potentially related to economic conditions, political developments, or social issues - that attract at least 10,000 participants, and the Global Protest Tracker documents this protest with the appropriate participant count and start date before the July 1 deadline",
    "rationale": "Turkey has demonstrated capacity for large-scale protests historically, most notably the 2013 Gezi Park protests. The existence of a Wikipedia article titled '2025 Turkish protests' suggests there has been notable protest activity this year, though I lack specific details about participant numbers or Global Protest Tracker coverage. With 55 days remaining, there is sufficient time for large protests to emerge and be documented. However, several uncertainties work against a higher probability: (1) My research assistant provided no additional information, leaving me without current intelligence on protest activity or conditions; (2) Not all protests reach 10,000 participants - this is a substantial threshold; (3) The Global Protest Tracker must specifically record the event with accurate participant counts; (4) The protest must start after the question launched, excluding any earlier 2025 protests. Turkey faces ongoing economic challenges and political tensions that could trigger mass protests, but the status quo bias suggests anchoring toward 'No' absent concrete evidence of imminent large-scale mobilization. I would update higher with news of: planned mass demonstrations, deteriorating economic crisis, or confirmation that qualifying protests have occurred. I would update lower if: time passes without such activity, reports indicate recent protests were smaller scale, or if political/economic conditions stabilize.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 Turkish protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Turkish_protests)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nPlease note that the Global Protest Tracker uses the name Türkiye in its database.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
