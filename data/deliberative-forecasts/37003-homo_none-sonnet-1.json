    "review": "All three forecasters converge on remarkably similar reasoning and forecasts (70-75% range), which suggests we're identifying the key factors appropriately. Forecaster 2 and 3 both emphasize the same core elements I identified: Vienna's 80-year SPÖ dominance, distinct urban/left-leaning political culture, and concerning national FPÖ gains. Forecaster 3 raises a valid point about 'voter fatigue' from long-term incumbency that I hadn't explicitly considered. However, this factor is likely already reflected in any recent erosion of SPÖ support rather than being a new risk factor. The fact that all three of us independently arrived at 70-75% probability without access to the specific March 2025 poll numbers suggests this range appropriately balances the overwhelming historical baseline against meaningful contemporary uncertainty. No forecaster presented evidence or arguments that fundamentally challenge my analysis.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, the convergence around 70-75% appears well-calibrated. The 'voter fatigue' argument from Forecaster 3 has some merit - 80 years of uninterrupted governance could theoretically create anti-establishment sentiment even in a traditional stronghold. However, if this were a dominant factor, we would likely have seen it manifest in previous recent elections. The more salient risk remains national-level FPÖ momentum potentially penetrating Vienna's traditional SPÖ firewall. The reference to March 2025 polling suggests active competitive dynamics worth monitoring. Given the strong consensus among forecasters and the balance of very strong historical precedent against real but manageable contemporary risks, I'm making a modest downward adjustment from 75% to 73%. This reflects slightly increased weight on the combination of voter fatigue and national volatility arguments while maintaining that the historical baseline overwhelmingly favors SPÖ plurality victory.",
