  "information": "The relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has recently shown signs of strain. After investing heavily in Trump's 2024 campaign, Musk was appointed co-director of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). However, disagreements arose over Musk's proposals for drastic government spending cuts and his support for policies like H-1B visas, which conflicted with Trump's agenda. In May 2025, Musk announced he would reduce his political involvement and spending to focus on his businesses, leading to a mutually agreed-upon withdrawal from his role in DOGE. Correspondingly, analyses show that Trump has not mentioned Musk on his Truth Social account in over a month, a significant decrease from his previous frequency.\n\nThe Trump administration's current immigration policy focus is on a new 'Gold Card' visa plan designed to attract foreign investors with at least $5 million in funds. The plan, which is not yet passed by Congress, would grant permanent residence and work rights. Elon Musk confirmed on the social media platform X that the government is conducting a 'silent test' of the application website. The proposal has sparked debate on whether it will replace or supplement the existing EB-5 investment visa program. Separately, the administration opened the registration period for the H-1B visa program, which both Trump and Musk have supported, for the 2026 fiscal year in March 2025.\n\nRecent activity shows a shift in the priorities and communication styles of both Elon Musk and Donald Trump. An analysis of Musk's posts on X revealed that his content has shifted away from U.S. government and politics, with only 19% of his posts in May being on these topics compared to 51% in February. He is now posting more about his business ventures, including space travel, electric vehicles, and AI. Meanwhile, Donald Trump primarily uses Truth Social for his communications, with reports noting that posts from his account on X are rare.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks, with the resolution date on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Given their current priorities and social media habits, neither Donald Trump nor Elon Musk are likely to tweet the specific phrase \"diversity visa\".",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The July 1, 2025 deadline passes. No major E-Verify related news or controversy emerges to capture the attention of either Donald Trump or Elon Musk. Trump continues to focus on other immigration policies like the 'Gold Card' visa and communicates primarily via Truth Social. Musk continues his observed shift away from U.S. political commentary on X, focusing instead on his business ventures. The topic simply does not become salient enough to trigger a post from either individual.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant and unexpected event brings the Diversity Visa program into the national spotlight before the deadline. This could be a high-profile crime or terrorist act committed by a visa recipient, prompting a reactive tweet from Trump, who has previously criticized the program. Alternatively, a viral debate on immigration policy on X could draw in Musk, who might use the specific phrase in a reply or a broader commentary on immigration systems.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the low base rate of any two specific individuals tweeting an exact two-word phrase, combined with strong evidence that both individuals are currently unlikely to do so. The research provided indicates several factors strongly favoring a 'No' outcome. First, the timeframe is very short, with only about five weeks until the July 1, 2025 deadline, reducing the window for a triggering event. Second, both individuals' attention and communication habits are misaligned with this topic. Donald Trump's administration is focused on a new 'Gold Card' visa, and he rarely uses X, his primary platform being Truth Social. Elon Musk is actively reducing his political commentary on X (down from 51% to 19% of his posts) to focus on his companies. Third, the reported strain in their relationship makes any coordinated or overlapping messaging on a niche policy topic highly improbable.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 2% because both Trump and Musk are known for their unpredictable and reactive social media behavior. Immigration is a volatile political issue, and an unforeseen news event could quickly make the Diversity Visa a salient topic, potentially prompting a tweet from either of them. Trump in particular has a history of criticizing this specific program.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the current trajectory for both individuals points sharply away from this outcome. The status quo, in which their attention is directed elsewhere, is a strong predictor over this short timeframe. For a 'Yes' outcome to occur, the status quo would need to be disrupted by a significant external event.\n\nI would raise my forecast if a major news story directly involving the Diversity Visa program were to break, or if either Trump or Musk began discussing lottery-based immigration systems in general. Conversely, as the deadline approaches without such a catalyst, my confidence in the 'No' outcome would increase.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**. If not, it resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has recently shown signs of strain.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
