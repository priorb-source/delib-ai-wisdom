    "review": "The analysis from the other two forecasters is highly convincing and aligns almost perfectly with my own. We have all identified the same two primary drivers for this question: the 'gradualist' political platform of Greenland's newly elected government and the extremely compressed timeframe of less than two months until the resolution date. They did not raise any evidence I hadn't considered, but the strong consensus reinforces my confidence in the initial assessment. The unanimity in both the final probability (5%) and the underlying rationale suggests that the key factors pointing towards a 'No' outcome are clear and compelling.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from my fellow forecasters, I am maintaining my forecast. The deliberation process has strengthened my conviction in my initial reasoning. There is a strong consensus that the two most critical factors are the political mandate of the ruling Siumut party and the short timeline. The government won the March 2025 election on a gradualist platform, prioritizing economic stability before pursuing an independence vote. Reversing this core mandate to announce a referendum within two months of taking office is politically improbable and would undermine their credibility. Furthermore, the practical timeline for organizing and announcing such a significant constitutional step before July 1, 2025, is unfeasible through normal political processes. While all three of us acknowledge a small probability for an unexpected political maneuver or a crisis-driven announcement, the overwhelming evidence points towards the status quo holding. The一致意见 (consensus) from the deliberation gives me no reason to adjust my initial forecast.",
