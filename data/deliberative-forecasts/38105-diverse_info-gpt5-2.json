    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds plausible near-term process signals (mission in Beirut, June 10 talks, an EFF draft) and interprets them as momentum. However, they underweight binding constraints: IMF insistence on still-unmet prior actions (bank restructuring/capital controls), the time required for LOI/MEFP finalization and Board scheduling, and the resolution’s requirement that an agreement include actual IMF financing. A staff-level agreement alone would not resolve this question as Yes. A ~$3b EFF concept has existed since 2022, so the mere existence of a draft is not strong new information. The finance minister’s optimism is historically a weak predictor.\n\nForecaster 3’s 40% also seems high. They cite political commitment and external incentives, but the reference to President Aoun (no longer president) is a factual red flag. EU funds may add pressure, but IMF financing still hinges on reforms the Fund has called “slow,” with specific governance objections outstanding. A June 10 “focal point” could generate headlines, but not necessarily a signed, financing-bearing IMF agreement within the month. \n\nNet: Both raise the prospect of ongoing talks and a June timeline, which I had considered in tail scenarios. I do not find their arguments sufficient to overcome the tight Board/process timeline and unresolved prior actions, but I acknowledge a slightly higher chance of a rapid instrument or a rush-to-board if major laws pass very quickly.",
    "rationale": "Time left is ~32 days. To resolve Yes, there must be an announced, signed IMF-Lebanon agreement that includes IMF financing (e.g., Board-approved arrangement or rapid financing). Negotiating an SLA in early June would still require: (1) passing IMF-compliant bank restructuring and related measures; (2) finalizing LOI/MEFP; (3) scheduling and holding a Board meeting in June. IMF statements calling progress “slow” and expressing specific concerns about the banking law suggest the reforms are not yet Board-ready. Rapid instruments are a tail path, but the IMF has been cautious with Lebanon absent reforms. \n\nI incorporate the new signals (mission presence, June 10 talks) as modestly positive for an SLA, but they don’t substantially change the probability of a signed, financing-bearing agreement before July 1. I slightly raise my forecast to reflect the possibility of an accelerated package if Parliament unexpectedly passes key laws and the IMF fast-tracks a Board date, or if a rapid facility is justified by a shock and acceptable to the Fund. Barring that, the status quo remains No.",
