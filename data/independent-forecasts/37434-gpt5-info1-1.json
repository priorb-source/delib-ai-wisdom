  "information": "According to its latest financial reports, AquaBounty Technologies' cash reserves declined from $9.2 million at the end of 2023 to $230,000 as of December 31, 2024. The company reported a GAAP EPS of -$29.47 and revenue of $0.79 million for the fiscal year, a 68% year-over-year decrease. The company's former CFO stated, \"We do not have sufficient liquidity to continue operations,\" and management has issued a going-concern warning. The company's reported debt-to-equity ratio is 0.05.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until June 30, 2025 inclusive)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the company continues to limp along without filing by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty secures just-enough liquidity via a small equity raise/ATM, bridge financing, or asset sale(s); stretches payables; or pursues a non-bankruptcy wind-down/strategic alternative. Operations are curtailed but no US Bankruptcy Code petition is filed before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Liquidity fully exhausts and the board files a Chapter 7 liquidation or Chapter 11 to run an orderly sale/363 process before June 30. A failed financing or asset-sale closing, missed payroll/vendor pressure, or impending litigation/lease rejection could trigger an expedited filing.",
    "rationale": "Evidence pointing to elevated risk: per the assistant’s summary of the March 27, 2025 release, cash fell to ~$0.23M at 12/31/24 (from $9.2M YoY), 2024 revenue fell 68% to ~$0.79M, GAAP EPS was deeply negative, management issued a going-concern warning, and even the (former) CFO said liquidity is insufficient to continue operations. Those are classic pre-filing signals. With only ~56 days left, if burn remains material and no fresh capital closes, a filing before July 1 is plausible. Countervailing factors: the reported debt-to-equity of ~0.05 implies limited creditor pressure; companies with minimal secured debt often avoid bankruptcy and instead raise dilutive equity, sell assets, or use non-bankruptcy wind-downs (e.g., assignments for the benefit of creditors). Also, we are already past May 1 with no filing; microcaps frequently find last-minute bridge funding or dispose of assets that can extend runway by weeks to a couple of months. The question resolves only on a US Bankruptcy Code petition by AquaBounty Technologies, Inc.; foreign or out-of-court processes would not count. Status-quo bias favors “No” over a short horizon, given no filing yet and the propensity for stopgap financing. Why not higher: low leverage reduces immediate filing pressure; there may have been post–year-end financings or asset sales not reflected in the year-end cash figure; and the time window is short. Why not lower: cash was extremely low at year-end, operations and revenues are depressed, management has flagged going-concern risk, and any failed financing or sale could force a near-term Chapter 7/11. What would move me up: disclosures of failed/exhausted financing efforts; notices of imminent shutdown, unpaid payroll, major vendor lawsuits, lease terminations, or explicit board language about preparing a bankruptcy filing. What would move me down: confirmed post–year-end cash injections (equity/debt), closed asset sales yielding multi-million proceeds, or credible guidance that runway extends beyond July.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill AquaBounty Technologies file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[AquaBounty Technologies Announces Full Year 2024 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603978/000160397825000012/aqb-20250327xex99_1.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to its latest financial reports, AquaBounty Technologies' cash reserves declined from $9.2 million at the end of 2023 to $230,000 as of December 31, 2024. The company reported a GAAP EPS of -$29.47 and revenue of $0.79 million for the fiscal year, a 68% year-over-year decrease.

The company's reported debt-to-equity ratio is 0.05.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
