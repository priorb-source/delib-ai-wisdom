    "review": "The other forecasters raised several important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 3 provided crucial concrete data: Carney had 48% approval in March 2025 pre-election, and 77% of Canadians held negative views of Trump. This baseline data significantly strengthens the case for a Yes outcome. However, Forecaster 3 also identified a critical risk I missed - Morning Consult may not yet be tracking Carney as a brand new PM, which would technically resolve as No. While this risk seems moderate (Morning Consult tracks all G7 leaders and should include Canada's PM by July 1st), it adds meaningful uncertainty. Forecaster 2's mention of the tariff dispute is contextually important and likely reinforces Canadian approval of Carney through contrast effects, given the strong anti-Trump sentiment in Canada. All three forecasts cluster in the 65-72% range, suggesting reasonable convergence on the key dynamics: honeymoon effect for new leaders, Trump's historically constrained approval ceiling, and strong structural advantages for Carney. The concrete polling data is more favorable than I initially assumed, but the Morning Consult tracking uncertainty and lack of current May data prevent an even higher forecast.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, the evidence is stronger for a Yes outcome than my initial 65% suggested. The pre-election polling showing Carney at 48% approval before his electoral victory, combined with 77% of Canadians holding negative views of Trump, provides a solid baseline. Post-election honeymoon effects typically boost approval by 5-15 points, suggesting Carney could be in the 53-63% range currently, well above Trump's typical low-40s approval. The 1.5-month timeframe until July 1st is short enough that honeymoon effects should persist. Key risks tempering my forecast: (1) the possibility Morning Consult hasn't started tracking Carney yet, though this seems unlikely for a G7 leader by July 1st; (2) the absence of current May 2025 polling data creates uncertainty; (3) the tariff dispute could create economic headwinds that dampen Carney's approval, though the strong anti-Trump sentiment in Canada likely mitigates this. The structural advantages are robust and the concrete baseline data is encouraging. I'm updating upward to 68% to reflect the stronger evidence base while maintaining appropriate uncertainty for the tracking risk and current data gap.",
