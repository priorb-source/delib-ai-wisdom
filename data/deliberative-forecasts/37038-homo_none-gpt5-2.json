    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a helpful pathway audit (301/232/201/IEEPA/Ch.99) and notes the VAT‑reciprocity idea behind a 17% figure—useful context that reinforces how unusual this exact rate would be and how little process exists to enact it quickly. Their 3% seems consistent with institutional inertia and timing. Forecaster 3 emphasizes that a suspended listing would still resolve Yes and cites industry concern reported in the press, pushing their estimate up to 18%. I don’t find 18% convincing: there are no visible USTR/White House/Federal Register signals, the 17% figure is atypical for US broad tariff actions, and creating an Israel‑specific Chapter 99 duty within ~5 weeks would likely produce public paper trails by now. The suspended-counts nuance was already in my base; the VAT argument, if anything, lowers the odds of exactly 17% rather than raises them.",
    "rationale": "Baseline remains the US‑Israel FTA with mostly duty‑free IL special rates; no current HTS entries list a flat 17% for Israel. To resolve Yes, we’d likely need a new Chapter 99 additional duty of 17% on products of Israel, even if suspended, posted on the HTS by June 1. Plausible legal hooks exist (IEEPA, 301, 232), but there are no public triggers, investigations, proclamations, or draft HTS amendments pointing to an imminent Israel‑specific 17% measure. The exact 17% rate is idiosyncratic in US practice, making even a late‑breaking move less likely to land on that number. Given the short runway (~5.5 weeks), lack of procedural breadcrumbs, and political costs, the tail risk remains low but non‑zero (an abrupt executive action with rapid HTS update). I slightly lower my estimate after considering that the 17% VAT reciprocity notion is not an active policy track and would more likely be broad, not Israel‑only.",
