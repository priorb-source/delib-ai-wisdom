  "information": "For the fourth quarter of 2024, Chegg reported a 24% year-over-year decrease in revenue and a 23% drop in subscription sales. This marked the ninth consecutive quarter of revenue decline for the company. Chegg's financial metrics include a negative Altman Z-score of -3.31, an indicator of potential financial distress. Conversely, its Piotroski F-Score is 7, suggesting some aspects of its financial health remain robust. As of its last report, the company maintained a net-cash position of several hundred million dollars, reported positive free cash flow, and had no large debt maturities due before 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "57 days (from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Chegg does not file for bankruptcy. Companies with positive cash positions and no immediate debt obligations rarely file for bankruptcy in such a short timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Chegg continues to manage its declining business through July 1, 2025. Despite ongoing revenue declines, the company uses its several hundred million dollar net-cash position and positive free cash flow to sustain operations. Management implements cost-cutting measures and explores strategic alternatives while maintaining solvency. With no debt maturities until 2026, they face no immediate financial trigger for bankruptcy filing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Chegg experiences an unexpected acute financial crisis in the next 57 days - perhaps a major lawsuit, regulatory action, sudden complete loss of subscriber base, or discovery of accounting irregularities. Alternatively, management strategically decides that Chapter 11 bankruptcy offers the best path to restructure under creditor protection, though this would be unusual given their current liquidity position.",
    "rationale": "The key factors strongly favor a No outcome. First, the timeline is extremely short at only 57 days - bankruptcy filings typically follow months of deterioration and exploration of alternatives. Second, Chegg maintains a net-cash position of several hundred million dollars with positive free cash flow. Third, they have no large debt maturities before 2026, eliminating the most common bankruptcy trigger. While the Altman Z-score of -3.31 indicates financial distress and nine consecutive quarters of revenue decline demonstrate severe business model challenges from ChatGPT disruption, these factors signal long-term vulnerability rather than imminent bankruptcy. The Piotroski F-Score of 7 suggests operational aspects remain functional. Companies with substantial cash reserves can sustain operations for extended periods even with declining revenues. Bankruptcy typically occurs when companies cannot meet obligations or exhaust liquidity - neither applies to Chegg in this short window. For the forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of: hidden liabilities, covenant violations, sudden cash burn acceleration, or management signals of strategic bankruptcy. For it to move lower: successful business pivots, revenue stabilization, or increased liquidity. The status quo strongly supports continued operations through July 1, 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chegg file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWall Street Journal: [How ChatGPT Brought Down an Online Education Giant](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-chatgpt-brought-down-an-online-education-giant-200b4ff2)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Chegg, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, Chegg reported a 24% year-over-year decrease in revenue and a 23% drop in subscription sales.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
