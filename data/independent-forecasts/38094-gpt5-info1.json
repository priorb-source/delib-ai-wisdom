  "information": "Reports from sources including The Boston Globe and The New York Times indicate Senator Fetterman has become increasingly isolated from the Democratic caucus. He has stopped attending the weekly Democratic lunches and has left the party's group chat. Concurrently, Republican colleagues have made deliberate outreach efforts. Newsweek reported that GOP Senators Tom Cotton, Chuck Grassley, and Dave McCormick have contacted Fetterman's office, and Republican Whip John Barrasso has publicly welcomed him to switch parties.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Fetterman continues to caucus with Senate Democrats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Fetterman remains formally in the Democratic caucus while continuing his iconoclastic posture (skipping caucus lunches, criticizing colleagues). He publicly reiterates he’s staying a Democrat and retains Democratic committee alignments through June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid break occurs: (a) he announces he’s becoming an Independent and will caucus with Republicans (or with neither caucus), or (b) he formally switches to the GOP, or (c) he resigns before July 1, 2025, thereby ceasing to caucus with Democrats.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the status quo usually holds. Despite reports that Fetterman has grown isolated from Senate Democrats—skipping weekly lunches, leaving the caucus group chat—and that GOP senators (Cotton, Grassley, McCormick) plus Whip Barrasso are courting him, none of that constitutes ceasing to caucus. Formally leaving a caucus is a high-salience, costly move that typically involves a public announcement and renegotiation of committee assignments. Fetterman has also said he won’t resign. His Pennsylvania brand, union ties, and prior voting alignment make an abrupt caucus break less likely, and a party switch could damage his standing with many PA voters. The one-month window further suppresses odds.\nWhy not higher: Party/caucus switches are rare; he has not signaled intent to leave, and resignation seems unlikely after stating he won’t. Short timeline limits the chance of a major realignment.\nWhy not lower: Unusual strain with Democrats is real; active GOP outreach lowers the barrier; if Democrats were to punish him (e.g., strip roles) or if a new blowup/scandal erupts, he could bolt quickly. Also, if chamber control stakes are large, both sides’ incentives could accelerate moves.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting that he’s considering independence; meetings with GOP leadership about committee assignments; staff shake-ups toward GOP-aligned advisors; public break with Schumer; Democrats sanctioning him; home-state polling showing a switch is viable.\nWhat would move me down: Explicit reaffirmation that he will remain in the Democratic caucus through the Congress; resumed participation in Democratic caucus functions; public praise or rapprochement with Democratic leadership; GOP leadership downplaying recruitment efforts.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Senator John Fetterman cease caucusing with the Democrats before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Fetterman says he won’t resign, gets support from McCormick as article blowback continues](https://www.pennlive.com/news/2025/05/fetterman-says-he-wont-resign-gets-support-from-mccormick-as-article-blowback-continues.html) | [An isolated, angry Fetterman is yet another challenge for Democrats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/16/john-fetterman-senate-relationships/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, John Fetterman ceases caucusing with the [Senate Democrats](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/about-senate-dems/our-caucus) for any reason, whether because he switches parties, resigns, or any other reason.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nReports from sources including The Boston Globe and The New York Times indicate Senator Fetterman has become increasingly isolated from the Democratic caucus.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
