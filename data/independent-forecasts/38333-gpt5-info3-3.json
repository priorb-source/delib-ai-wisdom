  "information": "Historically, in the last two open Florida gubernatorial cycles (2018 and 2022), major candidates typically announced their campaigns 12 to 18 months before the primary election. For the 2026 cycle, some contenders, such as Republican Byron Donalds and Democrat David Jolly, had already announced their candidacies by early June 2025. Reports note that as of early June, there have been no leaks of a launch date, no exploratory committee paperwork filed by Suarez, and no scheduled kickoff events for a gubernatorial campaign.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 25 days (through June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Suarez continues to “weigh” the race, does behind-the-scenes outreach, but delays a launch until later in the summer or fall—or decides not to run. With no clear donor/endorsement push and no paperwork or events scheduled, June passes without an announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He quickly finalizes a launch to capitalize on end-of-Q2 fundraising optics, files the necessary state paperwork, announces via press/video and a Miami event in mid-to-late June, and rolls out initial endorsements and a finance team.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and timing: The next 3–4 weeks are squarely in the historical 12–18 month pre-primary window when major candidates often announce in Florida. That makes a June announcement plausible in principle.\n- Current signals: Per the research assistant, as of early June there are no leaks of a launch date, no exploratory/paperwork filings, and no visible kickoff prep. In competitive statewide races, tell-tale prelaunch activity (staff hiring leaks, event holds, URL/branding, initial donor meetings leaking) usually surfaces weeks ahead of a formal announcement. The absence of these signs with less than a month left weighs against a June launch.\n- Field context: Some contenders (e.g., Byron Donalds and David Jolly per the assistant’s report) have already announced by early June, increasing pressure to move but also increasing the bar for a credible day-one rollout. Suarez’s 2023 presidential bid and subsequent scrutiny may dampen donor enthusiasm, making a quick, high-impact launch harder to execute on a short fuse.\n- Quarter-end/momentum counterweight: There is a strategic reason to launch before June 30—to post a strong first fundraising report and claim momentum. Modern campaigns can spin up quickly, so a late-June announcement remains feasible.\nWhy not higher: Lack of pre-launch signals, compressed runway to assemble a credible rollout, and a competitive field already taking shape suggest the status quo (no announcement by June 30) is more likely.\nWhy not lower: We are in the prime announcement window; a pre–June 30 launch has clear strategic advantages; and last-minute, press-release-style launches do happen.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of staff hires or vendor retainers, finance chair identified, event permits/venue holds, state-level paperwork filings, donor meeting leaks, or Suarez teasing a specific week/date.\nWhat would move me down: Public indications that he’s taking more time, endorsing another candidate, new legal/ethics headwinds, fundraising weakness reports, or credible reporting that donors are steering him away from the race.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Francis Suarez announces his candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorically, in the last two open Florida gubernatorial cycles (2018 and 2022), major candidates typically announced their campaigns 12 to 18 months before the primary election.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
