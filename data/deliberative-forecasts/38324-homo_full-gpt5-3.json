    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my priors: a Yes requires an earlier-than-usual debt‑limit deal plus a very rapid post‑lift catch‑up of roughly $0.8T by June 27. The most useful incremental argument they add is the operational timing: even if a deal lands on or near June 27, same‑day increases are constrained by settlement cycles; the immediate book‑entry replenishment of nonmarketables (hundreds of billions) likely isn’t enough alone, and large T‑bill issuance typically settles T+1/T+2. Their explicit framing that a mid‑June deal is needed to allow several settlement days strengthens the case for a lower probability. I find their reasoning sound and consistent with 2023 precedent (≈$360B next day, ≈$600B within a week).",
    "rationale": "My base view: with TPDO around $36.2T and the ceiling binding, the status quo path is flat near the limit. Reaching ≥$37T by June 27 needs (1) a suspension/raise by roughly mid‑June and (2) rapid restoration of extraordinary measures plus accelerated T‑bill issuance to rebuild the TGA. The added emphasis from others on settlement timing lowers the odds that a deal on/after late June could push the reported total above $37T by June 27, even with aggressive issuance. Given BPC’s later X‑date window (mid‑July–early Oct), the political incentive to act by mid‑June is modest. Conditional on a mid‑June deal, I still see a plausible path to Yes via several days of heavy bill issuance and trust‑fund restoration; but the joint probability (timely deal × fast catch‑up ≥$0.8T by 6/27) remains meaningfully below 50%. I’m trimming slightly from 22% to 20% to reflect the stronger operational constraint highlighted by the other forecasters, while keeping some weight on an earlier‑than‑expected resolution plus rapid issuance. Key updaters: credible reports of a mid‑June vote and Treasury signaling a larger‑than‑usual immediate replenishment/CM‑bill plan would push me up; confirmation that extraordinary measures extend comfortably past June 27 or that negotiations slip to July would push me down.",
