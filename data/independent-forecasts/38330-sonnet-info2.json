  "information": "In April 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the government to create a mechanism for the 'reverse purchase' of assets from foreign investors who have exited the Russian market. The government was given a deadline of May 15, 2025, to establish the procedures for these transactions. The decree specifies that the conditions for reverse purchases must account for the rights and interests of the current Russian owners of these assets.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days total, though the qualifying window is June 9 to July 1, 2025 (approximately 22 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the New York Times does not currently have articles using the term 'reverse purchasing' or 'reverse purchase' as evidenced by the search links provided",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The NYT continues its regular coverage patterns without using this specific terminology. If they cover the Russian asset repurchase mechanism or Chinese consumer trends, they use alternative terms like 'asset buyback,' 'forced purchases,' or 'shopping abroad.' The term remains primarily within Chinese and Russian policy discourse without crossing into major English-language international media.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The NYT publishes an article on Russia's new asset repurchase mechanism following Putin's decree, using the term 'reverse purchase' or 'reverse purchasing' when describing the policy. Alternatively, they cover the Chinese consumer trend of buying domestic products abroad as a business or economic story, adopting the 'reverse purchasing' terminology from Chinese media coverage.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. The term 'reverse purchasing' or 'reverse purchase' is specialized terminology originating from Chinese economic discourse and Russian policy documents, not standard English business vocabulary. While my research assistant identified a potentially newsworthy development (Putin's May 15 decree on asset repurchases from exiting foreign investors), several factors work against NYT coverage using this exact terminology: (1) The NYT typically uses conventional English terms like 'buyback,' 'repurchase,' or 'asset reclamation' rather than direct translations of foreign policy terminology; (2) The 22-day window (June 9-July 1) is quite short for a story to develop and be published; (3) Base rates suggest specialized foreign economic terminology rarely appears in major English-language newspapers without becoming a sustained international story. The Russian angle is more newsworthy than the Chinese consumer trend, but even geopolitically significant stories don't guarantee use of specific non-standard terminology. My forecast is not higher because the terminology barrier is substantial - even if the underlying stories are covered, different language is likely. It's not lower because there is genuine news value in the Russian asset story, and the deadline has passed, potentially triggering follow-up coverage. I would update upward if I saw other major English-language outlets adopting this terminology, or if the Russian mechanism led to significant disputes. I would update downward if initial coverage of Russia's asset policy used entirely different terms.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the New York Times mention \"reverse purchasing\" before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPeople's Daily: [“Reverse purchasing” reflects the vitality of the Chinese market](http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2025/0430/c1004-40471159.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the NY Times mentions \"reverse purchasing\" in any of its content items as found through [this search](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchasing%22&sort=best), dated after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025. This question will also count \"reverse purchase,\" which can be found through [this link](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchase%22&sort=best).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn April 2025, Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the government to create a mechanism for the 'reverse purchase' of assets from foreign investors who have exited the Russian market.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
