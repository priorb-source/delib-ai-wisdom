    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations continue but slip past mid‑year due to pricing, financing, offsets/industrial-cooperation terms, or Vietnamese political/bureaucratic caution about first-time procurement from South Korea and China-sensitivity. Alternatively, Vietnam pivots to a different 155mm system (e.g., truck-mounted) or defers the program pending budget cycles, leading to no government announcement before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seoul and Hanoi finalize terms for at least two K9 (or other Korean self-propelled howitzers) with support package, and DAPA/MND (Korea) and/or Vietnam’s Ministry of National Defence issue an official statement or joint release. The announcement could be timed with a ministerial visit or bilateral event, or a government-backed press note alongside Hanwha, explicitly stating an agreement to export to Vietnam.",
    "rationale": "- Short window: With roughly two months left, the base rate for rumored defense deals turning into government-announced agreements on that timeline is modest. First-of-a-kind sales (Korea’s first defense sale to Vietnam) often take longer due to legal, political, and industrial-cooperation details.\n- Evidence: The Korea Herald reports ongoing negotiations for ~20 K9s (~$300M). That is a credible signal of active talks and mutual interest, consistent with deepening Korea–Vietnam ties and Vietnam’s diversification away from Russia. However, as of today there is no official announcement.\n- Status quo bias: In arms procurement, slippage is common; absent a scheduled high-level bilateral event or credible reports of an imminent signing, the default is “no announcement yet” by July 1.\n- Why not higher: Limited time remaining; potential sensitivities with China; Vietnam’s cautious procurement process; possibility Vietnam prefers truck-mounted solutions; and risk of announcement being held for a later venue.\n- Why not lower: Clear report of active negotiations; strong Korean push to expand K9 exports; Vietnam’s capability gap and desire to diversify suppliers; and the relatively modest scale (20 units) that is feasible to close if major issues are already resolved.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting (e.g., Yonhap, DAPA briefings, minister-level comments) that terms are agreed in principle; notices of an upcoming state/ministerial visit with defense deals on the agenda; Vietnamese budget or procurement approvals referencing K9; Hanwha statements paired with government confirmation.\n- What would move me down: Reports of Vietnam selecting another system; indications of budget deferral; diplomatic friction; or explicit statements that talks have stalled or that any signing is targeted for the second half of 2025 or later.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information available beyond the Korea Herald note of ongoing negotiations; thus, I lean on general procurement dynamics and base rates, with modest credit to the reported talks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Vietnam and South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Korea Herald: [South Korea-Vietnam ties enter new strategic terrain, but need more detailed road map: Seoul envoy](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464718) \"Vietnam is reportedly in negotiations to import 20 units of K9 self-propelled howitzers from Korea in a deal valued at $300 million. If finalized, it would mark Korea’s first defense arms sale to the country.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the governments of Vietnam and/or South Korea announce an agreement for South Korea to export 2 or more self-propelled howitzers to Vietnam. If no such agreement is announced after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
