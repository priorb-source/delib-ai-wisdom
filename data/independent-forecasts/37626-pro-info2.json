  "information": "Dole plc, a major fruit distributor, reported its first-quarter 2025 financial results. While revenue decreased by 1.0% year-over-year, it increased by 4.2% on a like-for-like basis. The company's adjusted EBITDA decreased by 4.8%, a change attributed primarily to higher fruit costs and increased shipping expenses. The report also noted improvements in banana volumes.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month. The BLS is expected to release the price data for May 2025 in mid-June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The price of bananas has been trending slightly above $0.630 per pound in recent months due to persistent inflation and supply chain costs. Barring a significant market event, this trend is expected to continue.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The price is $0.630 or higher. This outcome occurs if sustained input costs, such as the higher fruit and shipping expenses reported by Dole, continue to be passed on to consumers, keeping the average retail price from dipping below the current level.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The price is under $0.630. This outcome becomes likely if the 'improvements in banana volumes' noted in Dole's report translate into a significant market oversupply, compelling distributors and retailers to lower prices to move inventory. Aggressive promotions by major grocery chains could also push the national average below the threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily weights the status quo, as banana prices, while stable, have been on a slight upward trajectory, with recent data points hovering just above the $0.630 threshold. The information from my research assistant regarding Dole's Q1 2025 results solidifies this view. The report's emphasis on 'higher fruit costs and increased shipping expenses' points directly to inflationary pressures that support a stable or slightly higher price, making a 'No' outcome more likely. While the report also mentions 'improvements in banana volumes,' a factor that could push prices down, I assess that these volume increases are unlikely to fully counteract the persistent and rising costs in the supply chain in the short term. Therefore, the balance of evidence points toward the price remaining at or above $0.630. My probability is not lower because the proximity of the current price to the threshold means minor market fluctuations or retail promotions could easily tip the outcome to 'Yes'. My probability is not higher because the noted increase in supply provides a plausible mechanism for a price decrease, preventing a very high confidence forecast in a 'No' outcome. I would update towards 'Yes' upon news of a supply glut or a sharp drop in fuel costs, and towards 'No' upon news of weather-related supply disruptions in producing regions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the price of bananas reported by the US BLS for May 2025 be under 63 cents a pound?\n\nQuestion background:\nQuartz: [Move over, eggs – bananas are the next victim](https://qz.com/bananas-dole-price-hikes-inflation-port-fees-trump-tari-1851772583)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the price reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics [here](https://data.bls.gov/toppicks?survey=ap) for Bananas, per lb. - APU0000711211, to the thousandths of a decimal point, is under $0.6300 for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDole plc, a major fruit distributor, reported its first-quarter 2025 financial results.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
