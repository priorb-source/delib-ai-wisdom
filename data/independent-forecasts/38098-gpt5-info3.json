  "information": "As of late May 2025, there was no publicly available evidence of preparatory activities for a Senate campaign by Ralph Norman. Reports indicated an absence of actions typically preceding a major campaign launch, such as filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for a statement of candidacy, the formation of an exploratory committee, significant staff hires, or major donor activity. The official filing period for the 2026 South Carolina primary does not open until the spring of 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Norman continues routine House activity and fundraising, makes no public Senate announcement, and July 1 passes without any declaration.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Norman stages a late-June announcement (press release, event, or exclusive) to leverage the Q2 fundraising deadline and quickly files FEC paperwork within the legal window after declaring.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: With about a month left, any declaration would likely be timed to a political calendar incentive (e.g., the June 30 fundraising cutoff) or a news hook.\n- Status quo weight: The default is that he does not declare. Challenging an incumbent senator of one’s own party is uncommon and usually telegraphed with visible prep (staff hires, exploratory efforts, donor activity), which the research assistant reports are absent as of late May 2025.\n- Strategic timing: While some 2026 Senate candidates have announced early, intra-party challenges to entrenched incumbents often form later to avoid prolonged intra-party warfare and potential backlash. South Carolina’s 2026 filing window isn’t until spring 2026, reducing pressure to announce now. Declaring this early could also complicate his House posture for 2026.\n- End-of-quarter caveat: The main near-term reason to announce before July 1 would be to capture Q2 fundraising optics. That keeps a non-zero probability alive despite the lack of preparatory signals.\n- Why not higher: No visible groundwork (FEC statement of candidacy, exploratory committee, staff, donor movement), no recent public signals, and high political cost/complexity of challenging a sitting GOP senator suggest a low near-term likelihood.\n- Why not lower: There has been past credible chatter (Axios 2023) about a potential challenge, and politicians sometimes announce without much warning to capitalize on a fundraising deadline or a timely news cycle.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of staff hiring, domain registrations or digital scaffolding for a Senate bid, donor meetings being scheduled, Trump-world or major conservative endorsements signaling imminent entry, or local SC media leaks of a planned event in June.\n- What would move me down: Public statements by Norman reaffirming focus on the House, endorsement of Graham, another prominent conservative announcing a challenge first, or continued silence past mid-June (diminishing the Q2 fundraising rationale).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ralph Norman declare his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Sen. Lindsey Graham may face right-wing primary challenge in 2026](https://www.axios.com/2023/09/13/lindsey-graham-primary-challenge-ralph-norman)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Will Ralph Norman declares his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, there was no publicly available evidence of preparatory activities for a Senate campaign by Ralph Norman. Reports indicated an absence of actions typically preceding a major campaign launch, such as filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for a statement of candidacy, the formation of an exploratory committee, significant staff hires, or major donor activity. The official filing period for the 2026 South Carolina primary does not open until the spring of 2026.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
