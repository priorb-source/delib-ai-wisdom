    "review": "All three forecasters identified the same core tension: the current de-escalation efforts (ceasefire, diplomatic push) versus the heightened risk of a rapid, kinetic response due to India's new, more aggressive doctrine and the specific delegation of retaliatory authority to commanders. Forecaster 3 anchored their 15% forecast in the historical rarity of strikes into Pakistan proper, arguing the bar for such an attack remains very high. Forecaster 2 gave more weight to the 'hair-trigger' nature of the delegated authority, viewing it as a significant change that increases the immediate risk, leading to a 30% forecast. My initial 20% forecast sat between these two positions. I found both arguments compelling. Forecaster 3's point about the resolution criteria requiring an attack on Pakistan proper (not just Pakistan-occupied Kashmir) is a crucial constraint that correctly pushes the probability down from what it would otherwise be. However, Forecaster 2's argument that the newly delegated authority represents a fundamental shift in the rules of engagement is perhaps the most important new variable. It is a deliberate policy change designed to bypass the very high-level decision-making that historically made such strikes rare.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am updating my forecast slightly upward from 20% to 25%. My initial reasoning correctly identified the key variables, but I believe I slightly understated the significance of the Army Chief granting 'full authority' to Western Commanders. Forecaster 2's description of this as a 'hair-trigger' is apt and convinced me that the probability of a rapid, escalatory response to a provocation is higher than I first assessed. This policy change is explicitly designed to alter the historical calculus that Forecaster 3 correctly highlighted. The threshold for a kinetic response has been operationally lowered, even if the strategic risks remain high. However, I am not raising my forecast to 30% because I believe the ongoing diplomatic offensive (until June 5) acts as a powerful, albeit temporary, brake on Indian action. India is unlikely to launch an attack that would immediately undermine its own high-profile international campaign. Therefore, the period of highest risk is concentrated in the last three weeks of June. The combination of the freshly-negotiated ceasefire and the diplomatic push still makes 'No' the most likely outcome, but the newly empowered commanders on a hair-trigger alert for any provocation raise the risk of 'Yes' into the 25% range.",
