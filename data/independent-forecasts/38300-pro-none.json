    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 weeks. The data for May 2025 is released mid-month, and this question will be resolved based on the value available on or after June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The most recent data point for April 2025 indicated positive year-over-year growth of 1.488%. Economic data series like industrial production exhibit strong positive serial correlation, meaning the recent trend is likely to continue into the next month.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and sharp contraction in industrial activity occurred during May 2025. This could be triggered by a major supply chain disruption, an abrupt tightening of financial conditions, or a sudden drop in domestic or international demand, causing the May 2025 index level to fall below the level of May 2024.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The US economy maintained its momentum through May 2025. Manufacturing, mining, and utility output remained stable or saw modest growth, continuing the trend observed in April. This results in the industrial production index for May 2025 being higher than it was in May 2024.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the strong persistence and momentum inherent in macroeconomic data. The most recent available data point, for April 2025, shows a year-over-year growth rate of +1.488%. In the absence of a major economic shock, it is highly probable that this trend continued through May. The research assistant's report indicated no additional information, suggesting no known major disruptions occurred in May. The general economic environment has been one of resilience, making a sudden, sharp downturn in a single month unlikely. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because there is always a degree of uncertainty and volatility in monthly economic data. A small negative shock, combined with a potentially strong base from May 2024, could be sufficient to push the year-over-year figure into negative territory. The growth in April was positive but modest, suggesting the sector isn't experiencing a powerful boom that would make a negative reading virtually impossible.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the default expectation for a stable economy is continued growth. A negative outcome would require a significant reversal from the April trend. Without any specific evidence of such a shock (e.g., reports of widespread factory shutdowns, a spike in energy prices, or a credit freeze in May), assigning a higher probability to a negative outcome would be contrary to the available evidence.\n\nI would increase my probability forecast if high-frequency data for May (such as weekly electricity output or manufacturing PMI surveys) showed unexpected strength. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if those indicators pointed to a sharp contraction or if news of a significant, previously unknown negative event in May were to emerge.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill monthly US Industrial production have positive year-over-year growth for May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Real Economy Blog: [Industrial production index hits record high amid tariffs](https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/industrial-production-index-rises-to-record-amid-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the monthly number displayed at FRED [Industrial Production: Total Index (INDPRO)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INDPRO#) for year-over-year growth is greater than 0.0 for May 2025, when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nWhen accessing the data, ensure settings are Units: Percent Change from Year Ago, Seasonally Adjusted and Frequency: Monthly. For example, the number for April 2025 was 1.48803 as of May 27, 2025.\n\nSince the numbers presented by FRED are expected to be preliminary numbers from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, please note that subsequent revisions to the number will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
