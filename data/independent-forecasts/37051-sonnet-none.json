    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 67 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Harvard maintains its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite Trump's threats, Harvard retains its tax-exempt status through July 1, 2025. The IRS either does not initiate revocation proceedings, or any proceedings initiated are delayed by administrative processes, legal challenges, or injunctions that extend beyond the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration directs the IRS to expedite revocation of Harvard's 501(c)(3) status. The IRS successfully completes all necessary administrative procedures within 67 days, and Harvard's legal challenges fail to obtain injunctive relief before July 1, 2025, resulting in actual loss of tax-exempt status.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires weighing Trump's demonstrated willingness to take unprecedented action against the substantial practical and legal barriers to revoking a major university's tax-exempt status within 67 days. Strong reasons for a low probability: (1) No modern precedent exists for a major research university losing 501(c)(3) status, (2) The timeline is extremely compressed for such complex administrative action, (3) Harvard would certainly seek immediate legal relief through injunctions, which courts would likely grant given the extraordinary nature of the action, (4) The IRS would need to follow proper administrative procedures even under political pressure, (5) Political threats often don't materialize into completed actions, especially on such compressed timelines. Reasons the probability isn't lower: The threat was reported just 10 days ago in credible media, suggesting some level of serious consideration. Trump has previously followed through on unconventional threats. However, even if proceedings began immediately, the combination of required administrative steps, due process requirements, and inevitable litigation makes completion by July 1 highly improbable. The probability would increase significantly with evidence of formal IRS proceedings being initiated or expedited administrative processes. It would decrease further as time passes without action or as legal challenges are filed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University lose its tax exempt status before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Trump Threatens Harvard’s Tax Status, Escalating Billion-Dollar Pressure Campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/15/us/politics/trump-harvard-tax-status.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, at any time before July 1, 2025, Harvard loses its [501(c)(3) status](https://oc.finance.harvard.edu/faq/harvard-university-tax-exempt-organization).\n\nIf there is no credible reporting that Harvard has lost its 501(c)(3) status with the Internal Revenue Service before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
