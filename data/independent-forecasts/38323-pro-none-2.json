    "no_outcome_scenario": "Economic concerns that likely drove the recent sentiment plunge, such as stubborn inflation, negative news about the labor market, or trade policy uncertainty, persist through June. In this scenario, consumer outlook fails to improve, and the final sentiment index remains at or below the 60.0 level.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A key piece of positive economic data is released in June, such as a cooler-than-expected inflation report or a surprisingly strong jobs report. This, potentially combined with falling gas prices or a stock market rally, provides a short-term boost to consumer confidence, causing the index to rebound and settle above 60.0.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is centered on the 'plunge' in consumer sentiment mentioned in the background information from mid-May 2025. This suggests the most recent data point (May 2025) was likely low, probably falling below or near the 60.0 threshold. Consumer sentiment tends to have inertia; a significant drop often isn't reversed in a single month without a strong positive catalyst. Therefore, the status quo suggests the index will remain suppressed, favoring a 'No' outcome.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 45% because the 60.0 threshold is a relatively low bar. Consumer sentiment is notoriously volatile and highly sensitive to salient, short-term news like inflation reports (the May CPI report is due mid-June), stock market performance, and gas prices. A single positive surprise on any of these fronts during the survey period could be sufficient to nudge the final number just above 60.0. The possibility of such a short-term rebound is significant.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 45% because reversing the strong downward momentum from a 'plunge' requires a catalyst. In the absence of decisively positive economic news, the pessimism from May is likely to persist, anchoring the June number below 60.0. The underlying drivers for the plunge, such as concerns over tariffs and inflation, are unlikely to be fully resolved within the next three weeks.\n\nNo information from my research assistant influenced this forecast. I would update this forecast significantly upon the release of the May CPI and jobs reports, and most importantly, the preliminary June consumer sentiment report, which will be released mid-month and provide a strong signal for the final number.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be greater than 60.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is greater than 60.0 for June 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
