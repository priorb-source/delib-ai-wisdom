    "review": "The other forecasters arrived at higher probabilities (85% and 90%) based on the same core logic that drove my initial forecast: the extremely small gap of just five fatalities to reach the threshold of 300. Their analyses reinforced that given the two-month timeframe and the ongoing conflict, the probability of at least five more UN staff fatalities being reported is very high. I found their reasoning convincing, particularly their emphasis on how even a significant de-escalation, short of a complete and durable ceasefire, would likely be insufficient to prevent the threshold from being crossed. Forecaster 3 also introduced a novel, though low-probability, scenario for a 'No' outcome: that OCHA could cease this specific form of reporting, locking in the last reported number. Overall, their higher confidence levels prompted me to re-evaluate whether my initial forecast was too conservative.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 80% to 85%. The deliberation with the other forecasters solidified my view that the proximity to the threshold is the most critical variable. My initial 20% chance for a 'No' outcome now seems too high. The other forecasters correctly underscored that the path to a 'No' resolution requires an almost complete stop to incidents causing UN fatalities for two full months. Even a partial ceasefire or a reduction in intensity is unlikely to achieve this. The arguments presented convinced me that I was slightly overweighting the chances of a sudden, effective, and durable ceasefire occurring and preventing this small number of additional casualties. I am aligning with Forecaster 2 at 85%, as this level better reflects the high probability of the threshold being met, while still allocating a reasonable 15% chance to the possibility of a significant de-escalation or a politically brokered ceasefire taking hold before the resolution date.",
