  "information": "According to media reports citing the Kremlin, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held phone conversations on February 12, 2025, and March 18, 2025. The February call reportedly lasted nearly 90 minutes. The March call was to discuss the war in Ukraine and a potential 30-day ceasefire proposal. On April 4, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that no phone conversations between the leaders were planned for the near future.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that a meeting between Putin and Trump is 'certainly necessary' and 'on everyone's lips.' However, Peskov emphasized that any such meeting requires 'adequate preparation' at 'various expert levels' and that, as of that date, there were no specific details or a set date.\n\nDonald Trump is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates in mid-May 2025 to participate in a Gulf summit. In late April, Trump mentioned the possibility of a meeting with Putin during this trip. On May 5, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Putin's schedule does not currently include a trip to the Middle East.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month and 9 days, with the resolution window closing on June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Diplomatic preparations for a potential future in-person summit continue through established channels, but these preparations are not finalized by June 15. No urgent international crisis emerges that necessitates a direct impromptu phone call between the two leaders within the specified timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant event, such as a major battlefield development in Ukraine or a third-party diplomatic breakthrough, prompts an urgent need for direct communication. Alternatively, Donald Trump initiates a call on his own accord, and Vladimir Putin agrees to speak, bypassing the formal preparation process that Kremlin officials have emphasized.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards 'No' primarily due to recent official statements from the Kremlin. On both April 4 and May 5, 2025, a Kremlin spokesperson indicated that no phone call was planned for the near future and emphasized that any high-level meeting requires 'adequate preparation'. This suggests a preference for a more structured, slower diplomatic process rather than an impromptu call in the next month. The fact that the Kremlin has publicly downplayed near-term contact twice in the last five weeks is a significant indicator against a 'Yes' outcome. The status quo is that no call is planned.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 30% because several factors could override the current diplomatic posture. First, there is a clear precedent, with calls having occurred in February and March 2025. Second, the geopolitical situation, particularly concerning Ukraine, is volatile and could produce a crisis requiring immediate leader-level communication. Third, Donald Trump's diplomatic style is often personal and less formal, and he might initiate a call that Putin accepts, bypassing the preparatory stages. Trump has also publicly floated the idea of meeting Putin, indicating his interest in direct contact.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 30% because the explicit statements from the Kremlin serve as a strong counter-signal. For a call to happen, either these stated positions would need to be reversed, or an external event would need to force the issue. The resolution window of roughly one month is also relatively short for the necessary diplomatic groundwork to be laid, especially if, as the Kremlin suggests, none has yet begun.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of lower-level officials beginning preparatory talks for a leaders' call. I would decrease my forecast if the middle of the resolution window (late May) passes with no new signals of contact from either side.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both Trump and Putin, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to media reports citing the Kremlin, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held phone conversations on February 12, 2025, and March 18, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
