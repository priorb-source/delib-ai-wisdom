    "review": "Both forecasters raise compelling points that challenge my initial optimism. Forecaster 3's emphasis on ITKF's typical 24-36 month advance notice for host announcements is particularly significant - we're in May 2025 for a 2026 event, meaning we're already well inside that window and late in the cycle. This reframes the April 29 meeting from 'encouraging recent progress' to 'concerningly late-stage discussions.' Forecaster 2's distinction between WKF and ITKF is valid, and both correctly emphasize that the question requires an official ITKF announcement, not Egyptian media reports. The most damning evidence I underweighted is Forecaster 3's point about the complete absence of public bid documentation on ITKF's official website - formal international hosting bids are typically public processes with visible timelines. Both forecasters effectively argue that 7 weeks is insufficient time for the full procedural cycle: bid formalization, board approval, and official announcement. However, I find Forecaster 3's 15% somewhat too pessimistic given the recency of high-level engagement and Egypt's 2014 ITKF hosting experience, which could enable a faster-tracked process. Forecaster 2's 35% better balances the competing factors but may still slightly overweight the speed at which smaller federations can move.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I significantly overweighted the April 29 meeting's positive signals and underweighted critical procedural realities. The key factors pulling my forecast down are: (1) ITKF's typical 24-36 month advance notice means we're already late for a 2026 event, suggesting the April meeting represents early-stage rather than final-stage discussions, (2) Complete absence of any public bid documentation on ITKF's official channels indicates no formal process is underway, (3) Seven weeks is very short for international sports federation decision-making, even for smaller organizations, (4) The bureaucratic nature of such processes typically involves board meetings, formal approvals, and contractual negotiations that cannot be rushed. However, I maintain some probability above the very low range because: Egypt has concrete hosting experience with ITKF from 2014 which could streamline processes, the high-level meeting shows genuine mutual interest, smaller federations can occasionally move faster than major ones, and there's no evidence of competing bids. The status quo of 'no announcement' is strongly favored by time constraints and procedural requirements, but not quite overwhelming.",
