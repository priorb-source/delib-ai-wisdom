  "information": "According to Baker Hughes data from mid-April 2025, the total number of active drilling rigs in the U.S. rose by 2 to 585. This followed a 7-rig dip in the prior week. The count of oil rigs rose by 1 to 481, and gas rigs also increased by 1 to 98. The total rig count is down by 34 compared to the same period in the previous year. Drilling activity in the Permian basin was steady at 289 rigs, which is 29 fewer than the previous year. The Frac Spread Count, which estimates the number of crews completing wells, fell by 10 to 195.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The outcome will be determined by the Baker Hughes North America Rig Count report for the week ending May 30, 2025, which should be published around that date or shortly after.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current rig count as of mid-April 2025 stands at 585 active US drilling rigs, which is 2 rigs above the threshold of 583. If the count remains unchanged, the question would resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The rig count remains at 583 or above through late May 2025. This could occur if oil prices stabilize or increase, encouraging sustained drilling activity. The recent +2 increase in rigs could signal continued stability, with operators maintaining current drilling programs through the spring season without significant reductions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The rig count drops by at least 3 rigs from the current 585 to fall below 583. This could happen if oil prices decline in the coming weeks, operators complete drilling programs and don't immediately start new ones, or seasonal factors reduce activity. The recent -7 rig drop from two weeks ago demonstrates this magnitude of decline is feasible within short timeframes.",
    "rationale": "The current count of 585 rigs sits precariously close to the 583 threshold - only 2 rigs above it. This proximity is the dominant factor in my analysis. Recent data shows significant volatility: a -7 rig decline followed by a +2 increase. The year-over-year comparison shows the count down 34 rigs, indicating a gradual declining trend. Additionally, the Frac Spread Count dropped by 10 to 195, which may signal reduced completion activity that could eventually affect drilling decisions. With 5-6 weeks until resolution, there's ample time for normal week-to-week fluctuations to push the count in either direction. The recent -7 drop demonstrates that movements of this magnitude occur regularly. However, I must weight the status quo heavily: the current reading is 585, and absent specific catalysts for change, rig counts tend to be relatively sticky in the short term as drilling programs are planned in advance. The question asks specifically about being 'less than 583,' requiring a net decline of at least 3 rigs. While the proximity makes this plausible, the status quo bias and the recent +2 increase suggest stability is slightly more likely. My forecast is not higher because we're so close to the threshold that normal volatility could easily push us below it, and the longer-term trend is declining. My forecast is not lower because the current count is above the threshold, and predicting specific directional movement away from the status quo requires stronger evidence than general volatility. I would revise upward toward No if upcoming weekly reports show continued increases or stability well above 583. I would revise toward Yes if reports show declining activity or if oil prices drop significantly.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive. If no such report exists, this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to Baker Hughes data from mid-April 2025, the total number of active drilling rigs in the U.S. rose by 2 to 585.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
