    "review": "The other two forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus, all arriving at a 95% probability. Our reasoning is strikingly similar, centering on the same pivotal evidence: the multiple news reports from early May 2025, following Berkshire's annual meeting, which stated the company increased its Domino's stake to 7%. We all agree that this specific, recent information is the most powerful indicator and strongly suggests the purchases occurred in Q1 2025. We also all noted that this fits the established pattern of accumulation from the previous two quarters. Furthermore, we all correctly identified and weighed the key uncertainties—the small risk that the news reports are inaccurate or that the purchases occurred after the March 31, 2025 cutoff. Forecaster 2 made a helpful point by explicitly highlighting that the threshold for a 'Yes' is extremely low (any net purchase), which strengthens the case given the reports suggest a *large* purchase.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 95%. The deliberation with the other forecasters has reinforced my confidence in my initial analysis rather than revealing any flaws or new information that would warrant a change. The core of the forecast remains unchanged: there is direct, albeit unofficial, evidence from multiple news sources pointing to a significant increase in Berkshire's Domino's stake. The timing of these reports strongly implies the information pertains to the recently concluded Q1. This specific evidence is supported by corroborating contextual evidence, namely Berkshire's pattern of buying DPZ in the two preceding quarters. The counter-evidence, such as Berkshire being a net seller of equities overall, is weak because the reports also confirm they were selectively adding to certain positions. The 5% probability assigned to a 'No' outcome remains an appropriate allocation for the residual uncertainty surrounding the accuracy and timing of the news reports. Given the strong consensus and the lack of any new compelling arguments to the contrary, my 95% forecast stands firm.",
