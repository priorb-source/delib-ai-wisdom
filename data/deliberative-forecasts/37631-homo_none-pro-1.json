    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the core dynamic at play: Tesla's high volatility and current business headwinds versus Walmart's relative stability. Forecaster 2 effectively framed this as a 'convergence of two key trends' which reinforces the consensus thesis. However, the most pivotal contribution came from Forecaster 3, who asserted that Walmart currently holds a narrow market cap lead. My initial analysis was predicated on the opposite assumption—that Tesla was slightly ahead. This single piece of information, presented as the current status quo, fundamentally reframes the forecast. It shifts the question from 'Will Walmart overtake Tesla?' to 'Will Tesla rally enough to overtake Walmart?'. This changes the burden of proof and was the primary catalyst for my update.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 60% to 68%. My initial 60% probability was based on the premise that Tesla had a slight lead, meaning a specific event (a stock drop for Tesla) was required for the question to resolve 'Yes'. After carefully considering Forecaster 3's analysis, I am now operating under the assumption that Walmart is already ahead. This makes 'Yes' the status quo outcome. The question now becomes about the likelihood of a positive catalyst strong enough to make Tesla's stock outperform Walmart's over the next 45 days. All three of us agree that Tesla is facing significant headwinds from competition and slowing growth, as noted in the background information. While a sharp, sentiment-driven rally is always possible for a volatile stock like Tesla—perhaps driven by news about its FSD or Robotaxi projects—it is now the less likely outcome compared to maintaining the current state of affairs. Walmart's stability provides a high floor, meaning Tesla must generate significant positive momentum to close the gap. This fundamental shift in the starting conditions warrants a significant increase in my probabilistic forecast for 'Yes'. I am stopping at 68%, slightly below Forecaster 3, to maintain a slightly higher weight on the sheer unpredictability and news-sensitivity of Tesla's stock, which could spark a rally even against the current fundamental trend.",
