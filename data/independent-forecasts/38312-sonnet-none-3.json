    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. The G7 Summit is typically held in mid-June, so the outcome will be known by late June 2025 at the latest.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - India has not been invited to the G7 Summit",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Canada does not extend an invitation to India due to ongoing diplomatic tensions between the two countries, or India is invited but Prime Minister Modi declines to attend given the strained bilateral relations and short notice.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Canada extends a last-minute invitation to India despite current tensions, recognizing India's importance as a major global economy and strategic partner. Modi accepts and attends the summit in person, viewing it as an opportunity to engage with other world leaders.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a NO outcome. We are already in June 2025, and according to the Times of India article, Canada has invited Australia and Ukraine but has not yet extended an invitation to India. This is particularly significant given that G7 summits typically occur in mid-June, leaving minimal time for an invitation, acceptance, and logistical arrangements. The absence of an invitation at this late stage, combined with Canada's explicit invitation of other guest nations, suggests a deliberate decision. Historical context matters: Canada-India diplomatic relations have been severely strained since 2023 over allegations related to the killing of a Sikh separatist leader in Canada, which could explain the lack of invitation. While India has been invited to G7 summits in previous years as a guest nation, host countries have full discretion over guest lists. The probability is not lower because diplomatic situations can shift rapidly, and there remains a small window for a last-minute invitation. India is a major global power and important economic partner that G7 nations would generally want to engage with. However, the probability is not higher because the combination of no current invitation, strained bilateral relations, extremely limited time, and explicit invitations to other countries makes Modi's attendance highly unlikely. I would update upward if news breaks of an invitation being extended or diplomatic rapprochement, and downward if the summit begins without India or official statements confirm India won't attend.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill India's PM Narendra Modi attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of India: [Canada invites Australia, Ukraine for G7 meet but no call for India yet](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-invites-australia-ukraine-for-g7-meet-but-no-call-for-india-yet/articleshow/121398906.cms)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
