  "information": "The West Northamptonshire Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025. The number of council seats has been reduced from 93 to 76 for this election, with 39 seats required for a majority. The current council composition is: 50 Conservatives, 16 Labour, 4 Reform UK, 3 Greens, and 3 Independents. The incumbent Conservative council leader, Jason Smithers, is not seeking re-election.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~11–14 days (votes on 1 May 2025; results expected by 2–3 May)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Conservatives remain the largest party (though likely short of a majority)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Labour sweeps most Northampton town wards and makes inroads in Daventry town; Reform UK splits the right-leaning vote in market towns/rural fringes, allowing Labour/Greens/Independents to edge additional seats. Labour emerges as largest party across the new 76 seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Conservatives retain dominance across rural South Northamptonshire and much of Daventry; despite losses in Northampton town and some market-town wards, opposition remains fragmented (Labour/Greens/Reform/Independents), leaving Conservatives with a plurality of seats.",
    "rationale": "What I know: The election is 1 May 2025 with seats cut from 93 to 76; 39 needed for a majority. Current composition (pre‑election) is Conservatives 50, Labour 16, Reform UK 4, Greens 3, Independents 3. The Conservative council leader isn’t re‑standing. West Northamptonshire combines strongly Conservative rural/market-town areas (South Northants, much of Daventry) with more Labour‑friendly Northampton town. There are no signs of a strong Liberal Democrat footprint here, whereas Reform and Greens have some presence.\n\nBase rates/status quo: In 2021 the Conservatives won a clear majority here and have remained the largest party throughout the term. Even after defections/by‑elections, they are well ahead of Labour in seats. With boundary changes reducing total seats, the default expectation—absent a dramatic realignment—is that the Conservatives will still return the most councillors, though likely fewer and possibly without an outright majority.\n\nHeadwinds for the Conservatives: National polling strongly favors Labour; 2024 local results showed significant Conservative losses nationally; Reform UK’s presence risks splitting right‑leaning votes; the local leader’s departure removes some incumbency benefit; boundary changes can add uncertainty and could concentrate representation in urban Northampton where Labour is stronger.\n\nTailwinds for the Conservatives: Rural South Northants and much of Daventry remain structurally favorable under FPTP; opposition is fragmented (Labour, Greens, Reform, Independents) and Lib Dems appear weak locally, limiting a unified anti‑Conservative challenge; even sizable swings often leave Conservatives as largest party in mixed rural-urban unitaries.\n\nWhy not higher than my forecast: The national environment is poor for the Conservatives; Reform could cost them seats; Labour could dominate Northampton and pick up additional gains in market towns, making them the largest party.\n\nWhy not lower: The Conservatives’ rural base and opposition fragmentation usually preserve a plurality in councils like this. From today’s composition and the area’s geography, Labour needs a very strong and broad-based performance beyond Northampton to overtake them.\n\nWhat would move me up: Evidence of opposition fragmentation intensifying (e.g., Reform standing full slates in Tory areas, Greens targeting Labour wards in Northampton), weak Labour candidate coverage outside the town, or credible ward‑level projections showing Conservatives holding most rural/mixed wards.\n\nWhat would move me down: Robust local polling or credible ward‑level estimates indicating Labour sweeping Northampton and gaining in Daventry town; news that Reform is standing selectively (minimizing Tory vote splits) or that boundary changes significantly reduce rural seat counts relative to urban; strong Labour ground game/candidate coverage across rural wards.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
