    "review": "The deliberation provided two contrasting but well-reasoned perspectives. Forecaster 2's analysis (10%) closely mirrored my initial assessment, emphasizing the very short timeframe and complete lack of public signals as strong evidence for a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 3's analysis (35%) was more bullish on a 'Yes' outcome, presenting a compelling argument that I had not weighed heavily enough: intense competitive pressure from recent competitor announcements could incentivize Anthropic to execute a surprise launch within the plausible annual release window. Forecaster 3 also astutely detailed how the strict resolution criteria (requiring the name 'Claude 4' and immediate general access) create several paths to a 'No' resolution even if a new model is released, which is an excellent point that tempers optimism.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 15% to 20%. The primary reason for this change is Forecaster 3's argument regarding competitive pressure. Recent high-profile releases from OpenAI and Google create a significant strategic incentive for Anthropic to respond with their own flagship model to maintain market momentum. This pressure makes a surprise launch with a compressed marketing cycle more plausible than I had initially considered. However, I am not moving closer to Forecaster 3's 35% because the total absence of public information remains the single most powerful piece of evidence. Major AI model releases are significant undertakings that are almost always preceded by official announcements, pre-briefings, or at least credible leaks, none of which exist here with only six weeks remaining. The strict naming and access criteria, also highlighted by Forecaster 3, further strengthen the case for 'No' by precluding intermediate releases (e.g., 'Claude 3.5 Turbo') or phased rollouts from resolving as 'Yes'. My updated 20% forecast now better reflects the tension between the strong negative evidence (silence) and the strong catalyst for a surprise release (competition).",
