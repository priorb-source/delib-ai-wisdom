    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 53 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement from the International Traditional Karate Federation by the deadline, so the question resolves No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ITKF has not finalized the 2026 host or chooses to announce after July 1 (e.g., at a later congress/event), or it selects a different host and communicates either later or not at all within the window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ITKF’s executive board approves Egypt’s bid in May/June and issues an official confirmation (website, press release, or verified social channels), potentially coordinated with Egypt’s Ministry of Youth and Sports, explicitly naming Egypt as the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship host.",
    "rationale": "Time is short (≈7.5 weeks). The only cited signal is a meeting/discussion with the ITKF president; that’s necessary but not sufficient. In many federations, host awards for 12–24 months ahead are plausible around now, but announcements often cluster around scheduled congresses or major events, which may fall after July 1. With no clear evidence of an imminent ITKF decision or scheduled announcement, the status quo (no announcement by the deadline) deserves extra weight. Egypt is a credible host (strong government backing, frequent hosting of combat sports), and smaller federations can move quickly—so a Yes remains plausible if a board decision is queued. However, absent corroborated official communications or a calendared decision meeting before July, the base case is a delay or later announcement. Research assistant provided no additional info, reinforcing that we lack confirming signals. Why not higher: short window, no official teasers or bid confirmation, typical governance cadence suggests announcements might slip past July. Why not lower: credible interest from Egypt, relatively small federation may finalize quickly, and 2026 timing makes a mid‑2025 decision reasonable. What would move me up: ITKF publishing an agenda indicating a late‑May/June vote, credible reports of Egypt as preferred bidder, or official statements hinting at an imminent announcement. What would move me down: reports of competing bids, governance or scheduling issues pushing decisions to later in 2025, or any indication the 2026 host will be announced after July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the International Traditional Karate Federation announce that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship?\n\nQuestion background:\nVetoGate Egypt: [Ashraf Sobhi discusses hosting the 2026 World Cup with the President of the International Traditional Karate Federation](https://www.vetogate.com/5400045)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the International Traditional Karate Federation announces that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
