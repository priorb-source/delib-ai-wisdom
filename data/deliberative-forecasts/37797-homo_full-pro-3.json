    "review": "All three forecasters have reached a strong consensus, independently arriving at the same 10% probability for a change to the FATF black list. The reasoning presented by the other two experts is highly convincing and aligns perfectly with my own initial analysis. Key points of agreement include: the significant inertia of the black list, reinforced by the lack of changes in recent plenaries; the near-zero probability of removing North Korea, Iran, or Myanmar due to their ongoing political situations and lack of progress; and the identification of Russia's potential addition as the only plausible, yet still highly unlikely, scenario that could lead to a 'Yes' outcome. The other forecasters correctly note that the high political and economic threshold for blacklisting a major economy like Russia has led to the current, stable state of membership suspension for over two years. Their analyses did not introduce any new evidence or arguments that I had not considered; rather, they serve as a powerful confirmation of the existing rationale.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of my fellow forecasters, I find no compelling reason to adjust my initial forecast. Their arguments reinforce my view that the status quo is the overwhelmingly likely outcome. The core of the forecast remains unchanged: removals from the list are exceptionally unlikely, and additions are also improbable. The main, albeit small, risk of a 'Yes' outcome continues to stem from the possibility of a major geopolitical event forcing a consensus to add Russia to the black list. The fact that two other experts independently assessed this risk at the same level strengthens my confidence in my 10% probability. This figure appropriately balances the powerful inertia against change with the non-zero tail risk inherent in the current geopolitical climate. As there is no new information to suggest an increased or decreased likelihood of change, I will maintain my original forecast.",
