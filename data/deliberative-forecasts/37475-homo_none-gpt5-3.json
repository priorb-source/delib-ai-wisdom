    "review": "Both forecasters echo my base-rate view: foreign-matter FSIS recalls commonly close within 1–3 months, and Johnsonville’s scale/experience supports timely effectiveness checks. New points they emphasized: the 60–90 day closure window framing (explicitly mapping our April 5 to June 30 window), that product is not extremely long-shelf-life in commerce (reducing tail risk of lingering product), and explicit consideration of FSIS page-update latency possibly pushing a closure just past July 1. None of this contradicts my prior; it slightly strengthens the case for modestly >60%. There’s still meaningful risk from recall expansion or administrative lag, but their arguments make a small upward adjustment reasonable.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining ~52 days (to June 30 EOD), which lands within the typical 60–90 day closeout window for Class II/foreign-matter recalls without reported illnesses. Scope (~22k lbs) and Johnsonville’s capability favor timely completion of effectiveness checks and product disposition. Countervailing risks remain: broad distribution networks can slow confirmations; any expansion or new complaints would push timelines; and FSIS site-update latency could delay the visible status change beyond the deadline. On balance, base rates plus the company profile make closure by June 30 somewhat more likely than not. The deliberation slightly increases confidence that the median outcome is a closure within the window, but the need for the status change to be posted before July 1 keeps this below 70%.\n\nTriggers: I would move up if no expansion/news by early June and pages stay quiet; I would move down on any expansion, injury reports, or signs of extended effectiveness checks into late June.",
