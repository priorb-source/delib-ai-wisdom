  "information": "According to multiple news outlets, U.S. government bodies have documented 757 cases of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) between May 2023 and June 2024. Of this total, 708 occurred in airspace, and only 49 cases had been officially closed as of early 2025. The Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is the primary body for receiving these reports. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also investigates UAP sightings, especially those confirmed by radar, and shares its findings with the Department of Defense.\n\nA specific incident in January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object during a training mission over Arizona, causing damage to the aircraft's canopy. The object was described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system' (UAS). This is one of numerous encounters reported by military pilots in the region, establishing Arizona as a hotspot for UAP sightings, particularly near military training areas and the border with Mexico. Former government intelligence officer Luis Elizondo confirmed that there has been significant reported activity in the area.\n\nSome U.S. officials speculate that a portion of the UAP sightings, especially in the Southwest, could be attributable to advanced drone technology used by drug cartels for espionage or smuggling. Ron Vitiello, an advisor to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, noted that the 'unlimited funding' of cartels could enable them to deploy technologies previously unseen in the drone sector. This theory has been presented as a potential explanation for some of the unidentified objects observed in restricted military airspace.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days. June 2025 begins in 10 days (June 1, 2025) and the question resolves when Metaculus checks the NUFORC website on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - at least one cube-shaped UFO is reported and posted on NUFORC's website for June 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes without any witnesses reporting cube-shaped UFOs to NUFORC, or any cube-shaped reports received are not processed and posted to the website by July 1, 2025 due to reporting delays or processing backlogs.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "During June 2025, at least one person observes what they believe is a cube-shaped UFO/UAP and reports it to NUFORC, which processes and posts the report to their database by the time Metaculus checks on July 1, 2025. This could occur anywhere in the United States, potentially in UAP hotspot areas like the Southwest mentioned in the research.",
    "rationale": "This forecast weighs heavily on recent precedent. The critical data point is that December 2024 - just five months ago - had 6 cube-shaped UFO sightings reported to NUFORC. While the question notes this is 'rare in the history of NUFORC,' the fact that it happened recently and with 6 instances (not just 1) suggests cube-shaped reports occur with some regularity, even if they're less common than other shapes like spheres or discs. The question requires only ONE cube-shaped sighting in the entire month of June 2025, which is a relatively low bar given the December precedent. NUFORC processes over 180,000 reports historically (roughly 300 per month on average), indicating an active reporting system. The research showing 757 UAP cases documented by government bodies between May 2023-June 2024 also suggests a generally active UFO/UAP observation and reporting environment. With only 10 days until June begins, there's little time for major changes in reporting patterns or public interest in UFO phenomena. However, I'm not estimating higher because 'rare' does suggest cube shapes are unusual compared to other reported shapes, and we have limited data points beyond December 2024. I'm not lower because the December data is recent, robust (6 reports), and we only need one report in an entire month. If May 2025 data became available showing no cube reports, or if I learned December was a massive statistical outlier, I would revise downward. If data showed cube reports occur in 70%+ of months, I would revise upward.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the National UFO Reporting Center report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a report of a sighting of a UFO/UAP shaped like a cube in June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nFor example, although rare in the history of NUFORC, the month of December 2024 [had](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202412) six sightings with a cube shape.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple news outlets, U.S. government bodies have documented 757 cases of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) between May 2023 and June 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
