    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "NOAA typically releases monthly global temperature data within 2-3 weeks after month's end. Since today is June 2, 2025, the May 2025 data should be available within approximately 1-2 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "May 2025 is very warm but does not break the record. The previous record (likely May 2024 or May 2016) remains the hottest May on record. This reflects the gradual cooling from 2024's extreme peaks as El Niño conditions have weakened.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 ranks as the 2nd or 3rd warmest May on record but falls short of the #1 position. This occurs because the transition from El Niño to neutral/La Niña conditions has reduced global temperatures enough that May 2025, while still very warm due to long-term anthropogenic warming, cannot overcome the extreme warmth of previous record Mays (particularly May 2024 which benefited from strong El Niño conditions).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 surpasses all previous Mays to become the warmest on record. Despite the weakening El Niño, residual ocean heat content, continued anthropogenic warming trends, and regional heat patterns combine to push May 2025 just above the previous record. The global temperature anomaly exceeds that of May 2024 by a small margin.",
    "rationale": "The key factors in this forecast: (1) 2024 was the hottest year on record with many individual months breaking records, driven by El Niño and long-term warming. (2) Early 2025 has shown a cooling trend relative to 2024's extreme peaks as El Niño weakened and neutral/La Niña conditions began developing. (3) The research assistant provided no specific information about May 2025's actual performance. (4) The question asks for a very specific outcome - being THE #1 hottest May, not just top 3 or top 5. The bar for breaking May 2024's likely record is quite high. While continued anthropogenic warming makes each year more likely to produce records than in the past, the transition away from El Niño suggests 2025 months may not consistently break 2024's records. The status quo principle suggests we should favor continuity - that previous records will generally hold unless there's strong evidence otherwise. Without data indicating May 2025 was exceptionally warm, and given the weakening El Niño, I estimate moderate but below-even odds. My forecast would be higher if: May 2025 preliminary reports showed exceptional warmth, if La Niña development was delayed, or if marine heatwaves manifested strongly. My forecast would be lower if: early June reports suggested May was only moderately warm, or if La Niña conditions developed more quickly than expected.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA report that May 2025 is the hottest May on record?\n\nQuestion background:\n[NOAA Climate change impacts](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NOAA at its [Climate at a Glance Global Rankings](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/rankings/globe/tavg/land_ocean/202504) tracker reports that May 2025 is the 1st warmest on record.\n\nEnsure that Region is set to Global. Ensure that Surface is set to Land and Ocean.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
