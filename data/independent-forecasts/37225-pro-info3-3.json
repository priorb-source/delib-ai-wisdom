  "information": "The general election is scheduled for May 25, 2025. A significant change in the electoral process is the shift to a National Proportional Representation system, which replaces the previous district-based system and will be used for the first time. The opposition is described as fragmented. The NDP is facing challenges after the death of former leader Desi Bouterse. Some smaller parties, including the Sociaal Democratische Unie (SDU), Permanente Voorspoed Republiek Suriname (PVRS), and De Nieuwe Wind (DNW), have formed an alliance to run together under the SDU banner.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The election is on May 25, 2025, and results are expected within a week of the vote.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Progressive Reform Party (VHP), as the leading party in the current government and the plurality winner in the 2020 election, would again win the most seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Public discontent with the VHP-led government's austerity measures, coupled with the unpredictable effects of the new national proportional representation system, allows another single party, such as the General Liberation and Development Party (ABOP), to consolidate enough anti-incumbent sentiment to win a plurality of seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The VHP successfully leverages its incumbency to maintain its position as the largest party. The opposition remains severely fragmented, with the primary opposition NDP weakened and in disarray following the death of its leader, Desi Bouterse. The anti-VHP vote is split across multiple smaller parties, preventing any single one from overtaking the VHP's seat count.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the current political landscape, where the Progressive Reform Party (VHP) holds a significant structural advantage as the incumbent and largest party from the 2020 election. The most crucial factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the state of the opposition. As noted in the research, the opposition is fragmented, and the main opposition force, the NDP, faces a significant leadership crisis following the death of Desi Bouterse. This disarray makes it very difficult for a single, unified challenger to emerge and consolidate the anti-government vote. The status quo, where the VHP is the largest party, is therefore the most likely outcome.\n\nHowever, my confidence is tempered by two major factors, which is why the probability is not higher. Firstly, the VHP-led government has implemented unpopular economic policies and austerity measures, creating significant public discontent that could fuel a vote against the incumbent. Secondly, and more importantly, the 2025 election will be the first conducted under a new National Proportional Representation system. This is a major variable with unknown consequences. It could level the playing field, benefit smaller parties, or alter the seat distribution in unexpected ways, moving away from the previous district-based results. \n\nMy forecast is not lower because, despite the VHP's potential vulnerabilities, the opposition's weakness is a more concrete and powerful factor at this time. For another party to win the most seats, they would need to not only capitalize on anti-VHP sentiment but also distinguish themselves from a field of other fragmented opposition groups. There is currently little evidence of a single party being positioned to do this effectively.\n\nI would increase my forecast if polling in the final weeks shows the VHP maintaining a clear lead and the opposition vote remaining highly dispersed. I would decrease my forecast if a major opposition coalition were to form, or if a single party like ABOP showed a significant and credible surge in popular support.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
