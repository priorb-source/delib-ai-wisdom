    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - All seven countries remain listed on Wikipedia as currently blocking X",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the seven countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, or Venezuela) reverses their block on X/Twitter, or Wikipedia editors remove one or more countries from the 'currently blocked' list due to changed circumstances or editorial decisions",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "All seven countries maintain their current blocks on X/Twitter and Wikipedia continues to accurately reflect this status by listing all seven countries in the 'Current' censorship section when checked on July 1, 2025",
    "rationale": "This forecast strongly favors the status quo for several compelling reasons. With only 26 days until resolution, the timeframe is extremely short for any significant policy reversals. Each country has well-established censorship patterns: China and Iran have blocked Twitter since 2009 (16 years), North Korea has essentially never allowed access, Russia blocked it in March 2022 during the Ukraine conflict, Myanmar blocked it following the 2021 military coup, and Turkmenistan maintains one of the world's most restrictive internet environments. These are not marginal cases but core examples of systematic social media censorship. None of these countries have shown recent signals of policy liberalization regarding Western social media platforms. The geopolitical and domestic political situations in these countries make sudden reversals extremely unlikely in a 26-day window. The Wikipedia listing risk is minimal - these blocks are well-documented by multiple sources, making erroneous editorial removal unlikely. The resolution criteria also protect against edit wars through admin discretion. The main uncertainty stems from Venezuela, which has had more dynamic internet censorship policies than the others, though even here a complete reversal in 26 days is improbable. For the forecast to be higher, I'd need 100% certainty about Wikipedia's editorial stability. For it to be lower, I'd need evidence of imminent policy discussions in one or more of these countries, which doesn't exist. Any significant update would require concrete signals of policy change from at least one country or unusual Wikipedia editorial activity around this topic.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
