  "information": "On March 13, 2025, the government of Chad officially granted Starlink an operating license. The stated goal is to enhance internet connectivity, particularly in remote areas where the existing 6,000 km of fiber optic infrastructure is insufficient, and to support educational and healthcare institutions. Government officials have stated that negotiations were conducted to ensure affordable pricing for the service.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the March 13 operating license, Starlink delays flipping Chad to “Available” until Q3 2025 due to finalizing local pricing/tax handling, import/logistics arrangements, distribution partnerships, or remaining regulatory/type-approval steps. The map continues to show Coming Soon or a later-quarter target past July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "SpaceX finalizes country-specific onboarding (pricing, tax, shipping) and begins accepting orders in Chad, prompting a quiet website update or brief announcement. The availability map flips to “Available” nationwide (or in any part of Chad) sometime in late May or June 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Time: ~6.5 weeks remain. That is enough for a website flip if commercial and regulatory pieces are ready, but the window is narrowing.\n- Evidence and base rates: In many countries, once licensing is secured, Starlink often brings availability within weeks to a few months, especially in 2024–2025 as operations matured. However, some markets have seen multi-month delays between license and actual availability due to local logistics, compliance, and pricing integration.\n- Current state: The assistant reports an official operating license as of March 13, 2025, with an emphasis on affordability and public-institution connectivity—signals of government support. Yet, as of today, Chad is not marked available on the map, implying at least a modest lag after licensing.\n- Status quo weighting: The world changes slowly; if nothing changes, the map stays “not available,” favoring No. But licensing is a meaningful precursor to flipping the map, and Starlink has a track record of accelerating African rollouts once paperwork is done. With roughly two months elapsed since license and ~six weeks left in Q2, I slightly favor a Yes.\n- Why not higher: It has already been about two months since the license with no map change; Chad’s logistics and market setup (pricing, taxes, importation, distribution) can be nontrivial and could push launch to Q3. Any need for additional type approvals or commercial arrangements would also delay.\n- Why not lower: The key regulatory gate appears cleared. Starlink’s satellite capacity and global operations are mature, and a web update to start taking orders can happen quickly once internal checklists are complete. Governments’ public support and negotiated pricing suggest momentum, not stasis.\n- What would move me up: Evidence of Starlink onboarding steps specific to Chad (pricing visible at checkout, local shipping options, government/SpaceX statement of imminent launch, distributor partnerships). A map tag indicating Q2 start.\n- What would move me down: Signals of unresolved customs/type approval, import restrictions, payment rails issues, or an official indication of Q3 timing (e.g., the map showing “Starting Q3 2025”).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Chad as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[SpaceX’s Starlink Secures License to Operate in Chad](https://spaceinafrica.com/2024/11/12/spacexs-starlink-secures-license-to-operate-in-chad/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Chad listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn March 13, 2025, the government of Chad officially granted Starlink an operating license. The stated goal is to enhance internet connectivity, particularly in remote areas where the existing 6,000 km of fiber optic infrastructure is insufficient, and to support educational and healthcare institutions. Government officials have stated that negotiations were conducted to ensure affordable pricing for the service.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
