    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 67 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — DJIA membership remains unchanged through July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No large corporate actions (acquisitions of a DJIA member, spin-offs that prompt rebalancing, major stock splits affecting sector weights), no prolonged crisis forcing a swap, and the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee opts to keep the current composition through the date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "S&P Dow Jones Indices announces a constituent change before July 1, 2025—e.g., replacing a lagging or lower-price-weight name such as 3M, Verizon, IBM, or Boeing to improve sector representation or following a triggering event (M&A, split, scandal). The announcement could be effective immediately or at a future date; either still resolves Yes.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates: Over roughly the last decade, the DJIA has seen several discrete change events (e.g., 2015 Apple/AT&T; 2018 GE/Walgreens; 2020 three swaps; 2024 Intel/NVIDIA). That’s on the order of ~0.6 events per year. Applying that to a ~2-month window implies around a 10% baseline chance of a change.\n- Current catalysts: There are no widely signaled, time-sensitive catalysts within the next two months. Typical triggers include major M&A of a Dow component, stock splits that distort sector weights, or extended underperformance that the committee seeks to remedy. None of the listed companies appears to be an acquisition target, and there are no announced stock splits of the very large, high-weight names that would force a quick rebalancing. While Boeing’s ongoing operational issues and 3M’s legal overhang might make them medium-term candidates, the DJIA committee has historically tolerated prolonged issues (e.g., Boeing during the MAX crisis) and tends not to act on short notice absent a clear catalyst.\n- Committee behavior: Changes are infrequent and often tied to clear narrative or sector-balance motivations. With NVIDIA added in 2024, a second reshuffle within ~16 months is possible but not likely in a narrow 67-day window without a precipitating event.\n- Why not higher: Lack of concrete, near-term triggers; recent composition update in 2024; committee’s conservative change cadence; short time remaining.\n- Why not lower: The committee can act opportunistically, and there are plausible candidates for replacement to improve representation (e.g., adding Alphabet or Meta by removing an older tech/telecom constituent). Any surprise M&A or major split announcement could prompt a fast change.\n- What would change my view upward: Credible reporting of an imminent DJIA reshuffle; a major announced stock split by a large Dow member that distorts sector weights; an acquisition or breakup announcement involving any listed company; a severe, new crisis (regulatory, accounting, solvency) for a constituent. \n- What would lower it: Explicit statements or signals from S&P Dow Jones Indices downplaying changes; stabilization and positive developments at the most at-risk names; passing of key industry events with no moves announced.\n- Research assistant input: None (no additional information available), so the forecast leans on base rates, known committee behavior, and absence of visible catalysts.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
