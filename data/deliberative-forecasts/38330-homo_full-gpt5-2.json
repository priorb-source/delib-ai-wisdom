    "review": "Both forecasters converge on the same key constraints I emphasized: the exact-string requirement, NYT style preferences (“buyback,” “repurchase,” “reverse repurchase”), and a very narrow 21‑day window. They also note the two plausible hooks (China’s “reverse purchasing” trend; Russia’s asset buyback mechanism) and the only realistic path to a hit being a deliberate quotation of the term, likely in quotes. They added the useful point that NYT often opts for alternative translations for Chinese neologisms (“reverse shopping,” “daigou”) and that “reverse repurchase” will not match the search. I find their reasoning consistent and persuasive; no new strong catalyst surfaced to materially change the odds.",
    "rationale": "Time window: June 10–30, 2025. The resolution depends on NYT search returning the exact strings “reverse purchasing” or “reverse purchase.” That excludes “reverse repurchase,” which is the dominant finance term and therefore removes a large portion of incidental hits. For Russia’s policy, NYT is more likely to say “buyback”/“reacquisition.” For the China consumer trend, NYT could cover it, but translation choices and house style make “reverse shopping/overseas shopping/daigou” more likely than “reverse purchasing,” unless they quote People’s Daily or another source verbatim. The NYT search index constraint also narrows eligible content. Given the short window, crowded news cycle, and stylistic headwinds, a single mention remains possible but unlikely. I see no new evidence of broader English-language uptake that would raise the odds. I therefore keep my forecast unchanged.",
