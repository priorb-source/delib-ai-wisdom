  "information": "GoPro's financial results for 2024 showed a full-year revenue of $801 million, a 20% decline year-over-year, with a net loss of $432 million, or $2.82 per share. As of December 31, 2024, the company held $283 million in cash reserves against $131 million in debt. The company's current ratio was reported at 0.5, and its market capitalization was approximately $90.68 million as of May 1, 2025, with a stock price of $0.58.\n\nFor its upcoming first quarter 2025 earnings report, scheduled for May 12, 2025, analysts expect GoPro to report a quarterly loss of approximately $0.13 per share on revenues of around $124.9 million, which would represent a year-over-year revenue decline of about 19.6%. The company itself has stated it expects unit sales and revenue in 2025 to be lower than in 2024, citing macroeconomic headwinds and competition. In response, the company has initiated plans to reduce operating expenses by nearly 30% during 2025.\n\nIn early 2025, GoPro announced it was named the official camera of the 2025 Freeride World Tour for the 12th consecutive year. The company also released a minor upgrade to its GoPro Max panoramic camera in February 2025. Reports in May 2025 also noted the release of a new GoPro Hero13 camera featuring an anamorphic lens. The company's most significant debt maturity is a convertible note due in November 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 53 days (from May 9, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - GoPro has not filed for bankruptcy and continues operating",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GoPro manages its cash burn through aggressive cost-cutting measures (30% opex reduction), maintains sufficient working capital to meet obligations, and the Q1 2025 earnings report on May 12 doesn't trigger a crisis. The company limp along until at least July 1, deferring any bankruptcy filing until closer to the November 2025 convertible note maturity if needed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The May 12 Q1 2025 earnings report reveals accelerating cash burn worse than expected, suppliers tighten payment terms due to bankruptcy concerns, working capital constraints from the 0.5 current ratio create acute liquidity pressure, and management files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late May or June to restructure operations and debt.",
    "rationale": "Status quo strongly favors No, as companies rarely file bankruptcy within such a short 53-day window unless facing immediate liquidity crisis. Key factors supporting No: (1) GoPro has $283M cash versus $131M debt - net cash positive position; (2) The major debt maturity (convertible note) isn't until November 2025, well after the July 1 deadline; (3) No immediate covenant violations or credit line pulls reported; (4) Company is actively taking remedial action with 30% opex cuts. However, significant warning signs exist: The current ratio of 0.5 indicates severe working capital constraints with current liabilities double current assets; The $432M net loss on $801M revenue (54% loss margin) is catastrophic; Market cap of only $91M with $0.58 stock price shows extreme market pessimism; Revenue declining 20% YoY and expected to worsen. The upcoming Q1 earnings on May 12 is a critical catalyst - worse-than-expected results could accelerate a crisis. For my forecast to move higher (toward Yes), I would need evidence of: acute liquidity problems, supplier payment issues, covenant violations, or disastrous Q1 earnings. For it to move lower, I would need signs of: stabilizing cash burn, successful cost cuts showing results, or improved working capital management. Given the very short timeframe and net cash position, but acknowledging the severe financial distress indicated by the current ratio and losses, I assign a low but non-trivial probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill GoPro file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and 2024 Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000150043525000003/gpro2024-12x31exh991xer.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nGoPro's financial results for 2024 showed a full-year revenue of $801 million, a 20% decline year-over-year, with a net loss of $432 million, or $2.82 per share.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
