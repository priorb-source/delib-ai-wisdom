  "information": "According to statements from Paul Gunning, the EPA's Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection, the Energy Star program and other climate-related work are being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.' Gunning's office, along with the EPA's climate change division and climate protection partnership division, are slated for closure as part of a broader agency reorganization. The stated goal of the restructuring is to bring the agency to 'Reagan-era staffing levels,' aiming for a savings of $300 million a year by 2026.\n\nThe Energy Star program was launched in 1992 as a voluntary public-private partnership to certify energy-efficient products. Over its 33-year history, government figures and expert analyses estimate the program has saved consumers over $500 billion in energy costs and prevented 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. The program's annual cost is approximately $32 million, while it is credited with saving the average household around $450 per year.\n\nDecommissioning a federal .gov domain typically requires a process lasting several months for internal approvals, security reviews, and coordination with the General Services Administration (GSA). Federal laws, including the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and record-retention statutes overseen by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), mandate archiving procedures. Historically, websites for discontinued federal programs have often remained online as static archives or with placeholder notices for years after the program ended. When other EPA climate-related webpages were targeted for removal in 2017, the outcome was a redirect or a static page, not a complete shutdown of the domain.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 48 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the site remains online and reachable.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "EPA/GSA rapidly decommission the energystar.gov domain or misconfigure DNS/hosting so the site is unreachable when Metaculus checks IsItDownRightNow on/after July 1; or a coincident prolonged outage (e.g., certificate lapse, CDN issue, DDoS) causes the checker to report it down at that moment.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Even if the program is being eliminated, energystar.gov remains reachable (possibly as a static archive, with a sunset notice, or redirecting while still responding at the domain), so IsItDownRightNow reports it as UP when checked on/after July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo: As of May 7, 2025, IsItDownRightNow reports energystar.gov is UP. Large federal web properties typically persist; changeovers are slow and often leave an accessible archive or notice rather than a hard shutdown. Given only ~7 weeks until July 1, inertia strongly favors the site still being reachable.\n- Evidence from the assistant’s report: The EPA is planning to eliminate Energy Star as part of a broader reorg, but decommissioning a .gov domain generally takes months with GSA coordination, security and records reviews, and NARA archiving. Historically, when EPA climate pages were targeted in 2017, outcomes were redirects or static pages, not wholesale domain shutdowns. FOIA and records obligations also push agencies to preserve public access at least temporarily.\n- Why not higher: There is some risk of a symbolic, expedited shutdown to signal program elimination, or an administrative misstep that leaves the domain unreachable around July 1. The resolution depends on a single external checker; transient outages, CDN/cert issues, or a brief DNS change at the time Metaculus checks could produce a false “down.”\n- Why not lower: The cost and effort to keep the domain responding (even as a static or redirect page) are minimal relative to the reorg scale. The stated savings target is by 2026, suggesting a phased process. Past precedent strongly favors continued reachability rather than abrupt removal.\n- Updates that would raise the forecast: Public statements or change logs indicating the domain will remain as an archive/notice; visible site changes that keep the domain responding (e.g., a deprecation banner while the hostname continues to serve HTTP/HTTPS); GSA/NARA guidance endorsing archival hosting on the same domain.\n- Updates that would lower the forecast: Official notices of imminent domain retirement before July 1; observable steps like DNS TTL drops and NS changes pointing to decommission, certificate non-renewals with expiration before July 1, or reports of the site already intermittently down.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to statements from Paul Gunning, the EPA's Director of the Office of Atmospheric Protection, the Energy Star program and other climate-related work are being 'de-prioritized and eliminated.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
