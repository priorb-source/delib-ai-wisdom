    "review": "Both forecasters lean on persistence, which I broadly agree with, but I see a couple of caveats. Forecaster 3’s specific figures look internally inconsistent: if 14.5M equals 73.9% of Florida’s population, that implies a state population around 19.6M, well below current estimates (~22M). They may be mixing “percent of area in drought” (e.g., 84%) with “percent of population in drought.” That weakens the precision of their buffer argument. Forecaster 2’s reasoning is cleaner: short horizon favors status quo; wet-season onset is the main pathway to a No. One point underemphasized in both analyses: in Florida, USDM categories in the peninsula can adjust relatively quickly once the wet season establishes, because short-term indicators (7–30 day rainfall, soil moisture, streamflows) dominate in summer; a single widespread 3–6\" event in SE Florida can knock millions out of D1+. On the other hand, the decisive update will likely be the USDM released Thu Jun 26 (valid through Tue Jun 24), leaving limited time for multiple subsequent downgrades before resolution. Net: I buy the persistence tilt, but I’m less confident than 65–78% given how sensitive the population count is to changes in the Miami–Fort Lauderdale–West Palm corridor.",
    "rationale": "Status quo is near/at the 14.0M threshold, so only modest improvement is needed for a No. The March CPC outlook calling for drought persistence through April–June supports a Yes, but it’s a coarse, early-season signal. By late June, Florida is usually into its convective rainy season; the USDM for Florida weights short-term dryness in summer, allowing faster category changes when widespread, soaking rains occur. Because a single organized tropical moisture episode in early/mid-June could remove D1 across parts of SE Florida, the population count is highly nonlinear: shifting even part of the tri-county SE metro (5M+ people) out of D1 can drop the state below 14M quickly. Conversely, if the wet-season onset is patchy or delayed and no broad soaking arrives, persistence at or above 14M is likely. Given the short remaining window and no concrete signal here of an imminent, statewide soaking, I still edge Yes on inertia, but only slightly. I nudge my forecast up modestly from 55% to 60% to reflect that we appear to be starting above the threshold and that USDM adjustments, while capable of being quick in Florida, still typically require sustained or widespread rain, which is uncertain on this horizon.",
