    "review": "I found the other forecasters' analyses very helpful, particularly Forecaster 2's. My initial forecast of 20% was heavily influenced by the older April 4 Kremlin statement that no talks were planned. Forecaster 2 introduced a critical new piece of evidence: a May 5 statement from Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov calling a meeting 'certainly necessary'. This is a significant development that shifts the likelihood upwards. Forecaster 3's analysis, which maintained a 20% probability, seemed to either be unaware of this new statement or interpreted it much less strongly, focusing more on general diplomatic inertia. I found Forecaster 2's reasoning more convincing because it incorporated the most recent and relevant public statements, while also correctly weighing the remaining logistical hurdles.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast. The new information provided by Forecaster 2 regarding the Kremlin's May 5 statement is a material change to the situation. My initial forecast of 20% was predicated on the previous status quo where no talks were planned. However, a public statement from the Kremlin calling a meeting 'certainly necessary' signals a clear and renewed political will to engage. This substantially increases the probability of a call occurring within the resolution window. I am now aligning more closely with Forecaster 2's assessment. While the Kremlin has opened the door, significant obstacles remain, as both other forecasters noted. The timeline is short for arranging a high-stakes call that requires 'adequate preparation', and we still lack a corroborating public statement from the Trump administration. Therefore, while the probability has increased significantly, it remains below 50%. The new Kremlin statement has moved this from a 'highly unlikely' event to one that is 'unlikely, but very plausible'.",
