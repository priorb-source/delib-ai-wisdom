    "review": "Both forecasters provided crucial new information I hadn't considered. Forecaster 2 identified that the EU tariff deadline was postponed to July 9, 2025, with ongoing negotiations - this means we're likely to see continuous coverage building toward that deadline through June. Forecaster 3 highlighted that a 90-day pause on trade levies is ending, which would trigger renewed intensive coverage rather than declining attention. Both made stronger arguments about the difficulty of BOTH papers simultaneously dropping tariffs, particularly emphasizing WSJ's business focus. These are significant factors that suggest we're entering a period of HEIGHTENED tariff coverage, not declining interest. However, I think they may be slightly too pessimistic given the 35-day window and the genuine possibility of major breaking news events that could dominate both front pages simultaneously. Their forecasts of 20-22% seem reasonable but perhaps marginally low.",
    "rationale": "The new information about active EU negotiations with a July 9 deadline and the ending of a 90-day trade pause significantly strengthens the case for continuous coverage. These aren't abstract policy discussions - they represent concrete, time-sensitive developments that will generate news throughout June. The WSJ's business-focused audience makes it particularly unlikely to drop economic policy coverage from its front page. However, I'm maintaining a probability above 20% because: (1) 35 days provides genuine opportunities for major competing stories - terrorist attacks, natural disasters, Supreme Court decisions, international crises, or major political scandals can and do completely dominate news cycles, (2) we only need ONE day where both papers happen to have different editorial priorities or breaking news that pushes tariffs off the front page, and (3) while the status quo favors continuous coverage, unexpected events are precisely what create these rare gaps. The combination of active negotiations and impending deadlines does make continuous coverage more likely than I initially assessed, warranting a downward update from 28% to 24%.",
