  "information": "The Bank of Japan's April regional economic report maintained its judgment that the Tohoku economy is \"recovering.\" The report specified that production of machinery and equipment is also \"recovering,\" driven by strong demand for semiconductors related to artificial intelligence development. A surveyed manufacturer stated they expected related product production to remain at a high level until at least the middle of 2025. Conversely, the Golden Week holidays, which fall at the end of April, typically dampen production in the region’s electronics and machinery plants.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2.5 weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "A slight month-over-month decrease due to the seasonal impact of the Golden Week holidays, resulting in a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Golden Week holidays reduce the number of factory operating days at the end of April, causing a contraction in output that outweighs the underlying strength in demand. This seasonal effect, potentially combined with a statistical pullback after March's strong growth, results in a negative month-over-month figure.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Exceptionally strong demand for AI-related semiconductors and other machinery forces manufacturers to run extra shifts and minimize holiday-related downtime, more than compensating for the fewer working days. Backlogged orders are filled at an accelerated pace, pushing the production index to a positive month-over-month reading.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the conflict between a strong underlying economic recovery and a significant negative seasonal factor. The Bank of Japan's assessment of a 'recovering' economy, particularly in machinery driven by AI-related semiconductor demand, is a strong positive signal. The testimony from a manufacturer expecting high production to continue through mid-2025 further supports this robust underlying trend. This indicates a high potential for growth.\n\nHowever, the primary factor influencing my forecast is the Golden Week holiday period at the end of April. This regularly reduces the number of operating days for manufacturers compared to March, creating a strong headwind for month-over-month growth. Given the large 7.6% increase in March, a statistical reversion or pullback is also plausible, and the holiday effect makes such a decrease even more likely. The status quo in this situation is for the known seasonal effect to cause a slight contraction.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 45% because the underlying demand for Tohoku's key products, like semiconductors, is reported to be exceptionally strong. It is entirely possible that this demand is powerful enough to overcome the seasonal dip in working days.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 45% because the reduction in operating days due to Golden Week is a near-certainty and a significant drag on production figures. It is a high bar for underlying growth to overcome to register a positive month-over-month change. The outcome is therefore slightly tilted towards 'No'.\n\nI would increase my probability if I received specific information about factories in the Tohoku region running overtime or through the holidays to meet demand. Conversely, I would decrease my probability on news of any supply chain disruptions or a softening of short-term orders in the electronics sector.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Northeast Japan region (Tohoku) show a month-over-month increase in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tohoku's March industrial production index rises 7.6% from the previous month, the first increase in three months](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCC214DI0R20C25A5000000/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [industrial production announcement](https://www.tohoku.meti.go.jp/cyosa/tokei/iip.html) for April 2025 (expected approximately June 21, 2025) reports a monthly change in production (\"生産\") of greater than 0.0%.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Bank of Japan's April regional economic report maintained its judgment that the Tohoku economy is \"recovering.\" The report specified that production of machinery and equipment is also \"recovering,\" driven by strong demand for semiconductors related to artificial intelligence development. A surveyed manufacturer stated they expected related product production to remain at a high level until at least the middle of 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
