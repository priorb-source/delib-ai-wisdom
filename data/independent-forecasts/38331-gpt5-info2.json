  "information": "The Indian government ordered X to block access to over 8,000 accounts in May 2025, citing a crackdown on 'anti-India content' and violations of local regulations. The blocked accounts included those of several Turkish and Chinese media organizations, as well as independent media outlets and journalists. X stated its disagreement with the orders, noting that 'blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship... and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech,' but indicated it would comply while investigating legal options.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Wikipedia continues to list all seven countries as currently blocking X/Twitter.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the seven countries (most plausibly Russia or Venezuela) is no longer listed as currently blocking X on the Wikipedia page by July 1, 2025—either due to an actual policy change/unblock, a shift to intermittent/partial restrictions, or a Wikipedia consensus change that reclassifies the status.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Wikipedia page remains substantively unchanged through end of June 2025 and still lists China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela as currently blocking X.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo/inertia: These are entrenched censorship regimes. Over a one-month horizon, durable policy reversals are uncommon. China, Iran, North Korea, Turkmenistan, and Myanmar are especially stable in their restrictions. That heavily supports a Yes by default.\n- Concentrated risk: The main downside risk is that Wikipedia editors reclassify Russia or Venezuela. Russia has maintained heavy platform restrictions since 2022, and broader censorship has intensified, making a near-term unblock unlikely; however, ambiguity (partial accessibility, compliance dynamics, or framing differences) could prompt a Wikipedia reclassification. Venezuela has a history of intermittent/ISP-specific blocks; editors could decide the situation no longer meets the “currently blocked” bar or reframe it as intermittent.\n- Wikipedia-process risk: A reorganization of the “Current” section or a consensus change based on new monitoring (e.g., NetBlocks/OONI measurements) could move a country out of the “current” list without a clear policy change. Admins may annul in case of edit wars, but that’s described as rare; I assign a small probability to classification churn near month-end.\n- Research assistant info: India’s recent mass account-block orders illustrate a broader global trend toward stricter platform controls, but India is not one of the seven countries in scope. It modestly supports the inertia-of-censorship thesis rather than suggesting liberalization.\n- Why not higher: Small but real chances that Russia or Venezuela are reclassified; plus a minor risk of page structure/rewording that removes one from the “current” list.\n- Why not lower: Five of the seven (China, Iran, North Korea, Turkmenistan, Myanmar) are highly unlikely to change within weeks. Even for Russia and Venezuela, signs point to continued restriction rather than liberalization.\n- What would move me up: Fresh credible measurements showing continuing or intensified blocking in Russia and Venezuela; Wikipedia talk-page consensus indicating stability of the current listing.\n- What would move me down: Reliable reports of Russia or Venezuela unblocking X, sustained multi-ISP availability measurements, or Wikipedia discussion indicating imminent reclassification from “currently blocked.”",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Indian government ordered X to block access to over 8,000 accounts in May 2025, citing a crackdown on 'anti-India content' and violations of local regulations. The blocked accounts included those of several Turkish and Chinese media organizations, as well as independent media outlets and journalists. X stated its disagreement with the orders, noting that 'blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship... and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech,' but indicated it would comply while investigating legal options.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
