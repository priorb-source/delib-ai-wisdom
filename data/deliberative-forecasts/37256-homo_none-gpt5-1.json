    "review": "Both forecasters align with my earlier view: short runway, multiple procedural steps, and no concrete signals. Forecaster 2 adds the AU mid‑year cycle as a potential spur; Forecaster 3 emphasizes the “tail‑end non‑ratifier” low near‑term hazard rate and the need for formal deposit by July 1. I find the tail‑end hazard-rate point and explicit emphasis on the deposit deadline incrementally persuasive. No new hard evidence was introduced, but these framing nuances modestly tilt me slightly lower than my prior estimate.",
    "rationale": "About 60 days remain. To resolve Yes, South Sudan would need cabinet approval (if pending), R‑TNLA passage, presidential assent, and timely deposit with the AU Commission by July 1. There are no credible public signals that these steps are queued (e.g., cabinet memos, committee reports, order paper listings, or ministry/AfCFTA Secretariat notices). South Sudan’s capacity constraints and competing priorities (security/humanitarian pressures, political agenda management) typically slow such processes. While ratification is politically low‑cost and could be fast‑tracked, late adopters tend to exhibit low short‑term hazard rates absent clear executive prioritization. The AU’s July cycle could motivate action, but the deposit must occur before July 1 for this question; last‑minute slippage is common. Given the lack of concrete movement and the need for multiple coordinated steps, I edge my estimate down slightly. I would move up quickly on credible reports of cabinet approval, R‑TNLA scheduling/passage, or official confirmation that the instrument of ratification is being prepared/deposited; I would move down if parliament is in recess through June or if mid‑June passes with no movement.",
