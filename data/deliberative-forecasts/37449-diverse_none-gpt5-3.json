    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce two points I already weight heavily: (1) a blockade is a major escalatory threshold with significant economic and military risks for Beijing, and (2) U.S. officials are careful with “blockade” terminology, often opting for “coercion” or “intimidation.” Forecaster 3’s emphasis on the short 56-day window and the need for visible preparations is useful, as is Forecaster 2’s stress on the high costs and the requirement for a major trigger. Neither offers evidence of imminent indicators (mobilizations, declared exclusion/inspection regimes focused on a specific port, or U.S. rhetorical shift). Their ranges (4–5%) are slightly higher than mine but rest on similar logic and tail-risk acknowledgment.\n",
    "rationale": "The resolution hinges not only on PRC behavior but also on U.S. choice of words—Washington must publicly accuse China of blockading a Taiwan seaport. Given the short timeframe, the absence of unusual mobilization, and the historical U.S. avoidance of the term “blockade” even during large PLA exercises, the bar is high. Gray-zone tactics or even intensive drills could disrupt shipping without prompting the U.S. to use that label. I would move higher if we saw: PRC-enforced inspections or interdictions that effectively shut access to a named Taiwan port (e.g., Kaohsiung, Keelung), AIS data showing systematic turn-backs, and U.S. briefings edging into “de facto blockade” language. I’d move lower with continued routine activity and explicit U.S. avoidance of blockade terminology. The peers’ arguments are sound but do not introduce new indicators to justify an upward revision. I’m keeping a low tail-risk allowance.\n",
