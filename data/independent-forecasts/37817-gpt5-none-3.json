    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (≈41 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Koror typically has only a small handful of direct destinations (e.g., Guam, Taipei, Yap, possibly Seoul), which is fewer than 6.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current network holds steady through July: United continues Guam and Yap; China Airlines continues Taipei; any Korea service remains limited to one city (if operating at all); no Japan or Manila routes are loaded as scheduled service. Total destinations remain 3–4, below the >5 threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Multiple carriers load additional summer routes before July: one or two Korean LCCs add ICN and a second Korean city (e.g., PUS), a Japanese carrier schedules a Narita seasonal service, and existing Guam, Yap, and Taipei remain. That pushes listed destinations to 6+ on flightsfrom.com by/after July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/status quo: Reporting as of April 2024 highlighted that Palau’s tourism and flight volumes had not recovered post‑pandemic, especially from South Korea. Palau is a small market with historically limited scheduled connectivity. My best read of typical current routes is Guam (United), Yap (United), Taipei (China Airlines, post‑bubble), and intermittently Seoul (varies by season/charter). That implies 3–4 destinations at present, well under 6.\n- Lead times: We’re ~6 weeks from the resolution date; airlines usually load summer schedules well in advance. A sudden jump to 6+ destinations would require multiple new routes, which is unlikely on this short timeline unless plans are already announced and filed.\n- Structural constraints: Mainland China package tours remain unlikely given Palau’s diplomatic stance with Taiwan, capping upside from the largest regional demand pool. Japanese demand has been tepid for Pacific island leisure outside a few strongholds, and Korea demand has been weaker than hoped per the cited article.\n- Why not higher: Moving from ~3–4 to ≥6 destinations within weeks would require at least two additional city pairs to be scheduled and displayed on flightsfrom.com. Given demand signals, airline economics, and timing, that’s a stretch.\n- Why not lower: It’s plausible that a combination of seasonal Korea routes (ICN plus PUS/TAE) and a Japan seasonal (NRT) could be loaded, and even low-frequency scheduled services count as destinations on flightsfrom.com. A single incremental Japan route plus a second Korean city could tip the count to 6 if Guam, Yap, and Taipei persist.\n- What would move me upward: Verified filings/announcements for additional scheduled routes (especially a Japan seasonal and a second Korea city) visible in OAG/GDS or on flightsfrom.com; confirmation that Manila or another regional city has scheduled service.\n- What would move me downward: Confirmation that Seoul service is not operating in July, or loss/suspension of Taipei or Yap; any evidence that flightsfrom.com lists only 3–4 destinations for the summer.\n- Research assistant: No additional info was provided, so I rely on base rates, recent reporting, and typical route structures for Palau.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 5 direct flight destinations from Koror, Palau on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMarketplace: [Why hasn’t tourism recovered in Palau? Flights haven’t restarted in high volume since the pandemic drop-off, and South Koreans are booking their vacations elsewhere.](https://www.marketplace.org/story/2024/04/19/palau-tourism)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 5 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Koror (ROR)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/ROR) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
