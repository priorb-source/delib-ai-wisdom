    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The 2025 Viennese state election is typically held in October or November. With today being April 21, 2025, there are approximately 5-7 months until the election outcome is known.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) wins the most seats. The SPÖ has governed Vienna continuously since 1945, making Vienna one of Europe's longest-running social democratic strongholds. In the 2020 election, they won 46 of 100 seats with 41.6% of the vote. Historical precedent strongly favors SPÖ maintaining plurality.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) capitalizes on recent national momentum and surges in Vienna polls, overtaking the SPÖ through anti-immigration messaging and dissatisfaction with the status quo. Alternatively, a coalition of center-right ÖVP with strong turnout operations could exceed SPÖ's seat count. Urban-rural polarization could weaken if middle-class Vienna voters shift rightward on economic or cultural issues.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The SPÖ leverages its deep organizational roots in Vienna, strong local candidate recognition, and the city's traditionally left-leaning electorate to maintain plurality despite potentially losing overall vote share. Vienna's demographics (younger, more educated, more diverse than rest of Austria) continue to favor social democratic politics. The SPÖ successfully frames the election around local housing, public services, and quality of life issues where they have credibility.",
    "rationale": "Vienna represents the SPÖ's most reliable electoral fortress, with uninterrupted control since 1945. The March 2025 poll reference suggests recent data exists, though I cannot access specific numbers. However, the fundamental question is whether nearly 80 years of electoral dominance will continue.\n\nFactors supporting a high probability for Yes: (1) Massive historical precedent - no party has won more seats than SPÖ in Vienna in modern history; (2) Vienna's distinct political culture as a cosmopolitan, left-leaning city compared to rural Austria; (3) Strong SPÖ party infrastructure and patronage networks built over decades; (4) Urban demographics generally favor center-left parties.\n\nFactors tempering confidence: (1) National-level political shifts in Austria with FPÖ gaining strength; (2) Potential erosion of traditional party loyalties; (3) 5-7 months is sufficient time for major campaign developments; (4) The reference to recent polls suggests competition may be closer than historical norms.\n\nMy forecast is not higher (85-90%) because: Recent European trends show traditional social democratic parties can lose even longtime strongholds when populist right-wing parties surge. Austria's national political environment in 2024-2025 has shown FPÖ strength.\n\nMy forecast is not lower (60-65%) because: Overcoming 80 years of SPÖ dominance in Vienna would require an extraordinary political realignment. Vienna's demographics and political culture remain fundamentally different from rural Austria. Status quo bias in forecasting demands substantial weight on historical patterns.\n\nTo update upward: Clear polling showing SPÖ with 10+ point leads; strong SPÖ candidate performance; national FPÖ scandals or setbacks. To update downward: Polls showing tight race or FPÖ/ÖVP ahead; major SPÖ scandals or leadership problems; extraordinarily high FPÖ momentum in Vienna specifically.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Social Democratic Party of Austria win the most seats in the 2025 Viennese state election?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee for example election polls at [Vienna: Poll by IFDD from 24.03.2025](https://politpro.eu/en/austria/polls/63413/ifdd/2025-03-24)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Social Democratic Party of Austria wins a plurality of seats in the [2025 Viennese state election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Viennese_state_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
