    "review": "The three forecasts (87%, 88%, 92%) show strong convergence, with all forecasters identifying the 94% historical base rate as the primary driver and the same key candidates for addition/removal. Forecaster 3 makes a particularly compelling point about redundancy - we have multiple independent paths to a YES outcome (BVI addition, Mozambique removal, potentially Nigeria removal), meaning all of these would need to fail simultaneously for a NO outcome. This redundancy argument strengthens the case for a higher probability. Forecaster 2's observation that the February 2025 plenary just made changes is noted but appears to be a minor consideration, as consecutive-meeting changes are common historically. The key difference in our forecasts comes down to how much weight to place on execution risk versus the strength of multiple independent pathways.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the redundancy argument is more compelling than I initially weighted. For a NO outcome, we would need: (1) British Virgin Islands NOT to be added despite its expired grace period and UK's willingness, AND (2) Mozambique NOT to be removed despite completing reforms and receiving positive on-site visit feedback in April, AND (3) Nigeria NOT to exit despite targeting end-of-May completion. While each individual pathway has uncertainty, the probability that ALL fail simultaneously is lower than I initially assessed. The 94% base rate combined with multiple concrete, independent pathways to change suggests I should weight the probability higher. However, I maintain some caution because on-site visits can still uncover implementation issues, bureaucratic timing doesn't always align perfectly, and countries' stated timelines don't always materialize. I'm updating from 88% to 90%, acknowledging the redundancy argument while preserving appropriate uncertainty about execution risk and the 6% historical base rate of no changes.",
