    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds the NBU’s guidance (Q2 peak; 15.5% policy rate; year-end 8.7%), which is useful context but not tightly linked to the near-term threshold. A Q2 “peak” consistent with their year-end forecast could still be around 14–15%, so it doesn’t rule out ≥15% in April. Their 30% feels low given March’s 14.6% YoY and the small incremental move needed. Forecaster 3 contributes concrete supply-shock evidence (energy infrastructure damage, labor constraints) and a timely Easter-basket YoY of ~18–19% that aligns with strong food inflation. That supports upside risk, though the basket is narrower than CPI and may overstate broad price pressure. I find F3 more convincing than F2 because it better addresses short-term drivers and base effects, but I note potential partial reversal of March category spikes (e.g., eggs) and seasonality that could temper April m/m.",
    "rationale": "From 14.6% YoY in March, only ~0.4 pp is needed to reach 15.0% in April. Using the standard approximation, April YoY ≈ March YoY + (m/m_Apr25 − m/m_Apr24). If April 2024’s monthly print was modest (likely, given subdued 2024 inflation), then an April 2025 m/m in the 0.6–0.8% range would probably push YoY to ≥15%. Risks in favor: continued cost-push from energy infrastructure damage, elevated food and utilities (March food +17.4% YoY; housing/utilities +20.2% YoY), and pre-Easter pressure persisting into much of April. Risks against: partial normalization after March’s outsized 1.5% m/m (notably eggs and some apparel), and NBU’s tight stance anchoring expectations. On balance, the threshold is close enough that only a moderate April m/m is needed; however, given plausible partial reversals after March’s spikes, I trim my prior 70% to 65% rather than higher. I would revise up with evidence of ≥0.7% m/m for April or further FX weakness/utility hikes; down with signs of broad category reversals or if April 2024’s base m/m was higher than assumed.",
