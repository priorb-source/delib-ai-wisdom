    "review": "Both forecasters provide solid analyses that align closely with my reasoning. Forecaster 2 makes an excellent point about counterfactuals - if Florida were consistently #1 in pilot reports historically, we'd forecast 40-50%, but since the data suggests rough parity with California having a volume advantage, this pulls the probability down to 25%. Forecaster 3's 38% seems slightly optimistic given California's 4.2x advantage in total sightings (36,286 vs 8,623), though I appreciate their acknowledgment that we're now only 10 days from June 2025 (not 3 months as I initially framed in my analysis of the March incident).\n\nThe critical insight all three of us share is the extremely small sample size problem: with only 8-12 pilot reports nationwide per month, each state typically gets 0-2 reports, creating massive variance. The tie-breaking rule (ties resolve No) is particularly important here - Florida must strictly exceed all other states.\n\nForecaster 2's baseline reasoning is compelling: California's substantial overall volume advantage suggests it likely receives more pilot reports on average, making it the favorite in any given month. The March 2025 incident, while notable, occurred 2 months ago and doesn't strongly predict June patterns given the high randomness in monthly data.\n\nI find myself most aligned with Forecaster 2's conservative approach, though I think there's slightly more uncertainty than 25% given Florida's strong #2 position and the demonstrated recent activity.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward from 30% to 28%. The key factors driving this adjustment:\n\n1. California's volume advantage (4.2x more total sightings) suggests a higher baseline probability of receiving more pilot reports in any given month\n\n2. With only 8-12 pilot reports nationwide monthly, if California averages 2-3 and Florida averages 1-2, Florida needs both luck (to outperform its average) and California to underperform - I estimate this happens roughly 40% of the time\n\n3. Florida must also beat all other states (Arizona, Texas, Washington, etc.) - given Florida's strong #2 position, I estimate this happens about 70% of the time\n\n4. Combined probability: 40% × 70% ≈ 28%\n\nI'm not going as low as Forecaster 2's 25% because Florida is definitively in the top 2 states and recent activity (March incident) suggests ongoing elevated attention. I'm not going as high as Forecaster 3's 38% because California's historical dominance should carry more weight when the sample sizes are this small and subject to reversion to the mean.\n\nThe March 2025 military incident provides weak positive signal but occurred 2 months ago, diminishing its predictive value for June.",
