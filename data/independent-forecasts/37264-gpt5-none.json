    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Niger remains at Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) with some regions designated Do Not Travel.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security risks remain concentrated in border regions; no large, headline-grabbing attack or kidnapping in Niamey; the U.S. Embassy continues operating with limited but ongoing services; State issues routine updates but keeps the overall country advisory at Level 3.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major deterioration prompts an immediate upgrade, such as: a high-casualty terrorist attack or Western-targeted kidnapping in Niamey or on main travel corridors; significant civil unrest targeting foreigners; the U.S. orders departure or substantially limits embassy services, citing inability to assist U.S. citizens; or a sharp escalation tied to security force withdrawals that degrades in-country support and risk profile.",
    "rationale": "a) Time left: roughly two months, so only acute developments are likely to change the advisory level.\nb) Status quo: Niger’s overall advisory has recently been Level 3 with specific border areas at Level 4; absent a trigger, advisories tend to be sticky.\nc) No scenario: Continuation of present risks (terrorism/crime in certain regions) without a high-visibility incident in the capital or a major reduction in U.S. consular capacity.\nd) Yes scenario: A notable shock—major terror incident, targeted kidnapping of Westerners, or a U.S. Embassy drawdown/suspension—could push State to Level 4 quickly.\n\nReasoning: The U.S. State Department does adjust levels, but country-wide upgrades to Level 4 usually follow distinct catalysts (sudden security shocks, collapse of consular capacity, or war-like conditions). While Niger’s security environment is serious—border insurgencies, junta rule, tensions with neighbors—the national advisory has not been uniformly Level 4 to date. With only ~60 days left, the base-rate of a country moving from Level 3 to Level 4 absent a clear incident is modest. However, Niger’s risk is elevated relative to a typical Level 3 country: the Sahel jihadist threat remains high; there are ongoing political/military frictions; and U.S.–Niger security cooperation and U.S. military presence are in flux, which could affect consular support. These factors justify a probability higher than a generic baseline but still below even odds without a known trigger.\n\nWhy not higher: No confirmed current trigger (e.g., embassy suspension, major attack in Niamey) and advisories are sticky. The short window also limits the chance of a qualifying event.\nWhy not lower: The Sahel has a high volatility tail; a single severe incident or a consular drawdown can prompt rapid escalation to Level 4. Niger’s trajectory (post-coup dynamics, security challenges, U.S. force posture changes) keeps a non-trivial chance alive.\n\nWhat would raise my forecast: Credible reports of a U.S. embassy ordered departure or severe service curtailment; a significant terror attack or Western-targeted kidnapping in/near Niamey; cross-border clashes spilling into populated areas; intelligence-driven State Department alerts foreshadowing an upgrade.\nWhat would lower my forecast: Signals of stabilized security in the capital and main corridors; reaffirmations or updates that maintain Level 3; evidence of improved consular capacity.\n\nResearch assistant: No additional information provided; thus I rely on general patterns in State advisories, regional risk context, and the short time horizon.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Niger receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Niger Faces Growing Travel Risks: U.S. Travel Advisory Highlights Terrorism, Crime, and Limited Medical Care for Tourists in the Country](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/niger-faces-growing-travel-risks-u-s-travel-advisory-highlights-terrorism-crime-and-limited-medical-care-for-tourists-in-the-country/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Niger has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Niger.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
