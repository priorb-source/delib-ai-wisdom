    "review": "My initial forecast of 80% was too high, primarily because I failed to adequately consider two critical points raised by the other forecasters. Forecaster 3's argument that Uruguay could send a different representative, such as the Foreign Minister, is particularly compelling. This provides a clear diplomatic path for Uruguay to honor Brazil's invitation and engage with the summit without the full geopolitical weight of a presidential visit, an action that would resolve this question as 'No'. I had framed the decision as a binary choice between Orsi attending or delivering a diplomatic snub, which was a flawed premise. Secondly, both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 correctly emphasized the significance of the government's silence. With only 26 days until the deadline, the fact that no announcement has been made in the three months since the invitation is not just a lack of information; it is evidence of hesitation, internal debate, or a lower priority. Forecaster 2's focus on status quo inertia is a crucial reminder that the default outcome is 'No'. I find Forecaster 2's probability of 28% to be too low, as it underweights the strong positive incentives for a new left-leaning president to personally build a relationship with Lula. Forecaster 3's analysis at 52% is very persuasive and aligns well with my revised thinking, appropriately balancing the competing factors and noting the resolution criteria's specific focus on the announcement's timing.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downwards from 80% to 55%. The primary reason for this large revision is the arguments from the other forecasters, which exposed flaws in my initial analysis. My initial high confidence was based on the strong strategic and ideological incentives for President Orsi to accept President Lula's invitation. While these incentives remain valid, I now believe the probability of a 'Yes' outcome is much closer to a coin flip.\n\nThe most important new consideration is the plausible scenario, raised by Forecaster 3, where Uruguay sends the Foreign Minister or another high-level delegate instead of the president. This option allows Uruguay to avoid snubbing Brazil while simultaneously managing the geopolitical risks and optics of presidential attendance at a summit that includes Russia and Iran. This alternative resolves the question as 'No' and is a standard diplomatic practice I had overlooked.\n\nFurthermore, both other forecasters correctly assigned more weight than I did to the current status quo. Three months of silence from Montevideo is strong evidence of caution. With the July 1st deadline approaching, each passing day of inaction increases the likelihood of a 'No' outcome, either through a deliberate decision not to send Orsi, or simply through administrative delay pushing an announcement past the deadline. \n\nI am not lowering my forecast to 52% or below because I continue to place a high value on the personal invitation from Lula and the desire of a new Frente Amplio government to signal strong regional alignment early in its term. A joint appearance by presidents Lula and Orsi would send a powerful message. Therefore, I believe the chances are still slightly better than even that a last-minute announcement confirming Orsi's attendance will be made before July 1.",
