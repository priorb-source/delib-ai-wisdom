    "review": "The other forecasters raise several valuable points that warrant reconsideration of my initial 35% forecast. Forecaster 2 highlights that the article specifically notes the advance estimate was 'lower than expected,' which I glossed over but is potentially significant - it suggests market consensus anticipated positive growth, indicating the negative reading may have captured transitory weakness or incomplete data. Forecaster 2 also claims typical revisions range from 0.5-1.5 percentage points in absolute terms, which if accurate, means the 0.3+ pp upward revision needed here falls well within normal revision magnitudes. Forecaster 3's analysis closely mirrors my reasoning about respecting the status quo while acknowledging revision uncertainty. All three forecasts cluster in the 35-45% range, suggesting reasonable convergence around the core uncertainty. The key tension is between status quo bias (the advance estimate shows contraction and should be weighted heavily) versus the recognition that the margin is thin enough that normal data revisions could easily flip the outcome. I find Forecaster 2's point about the 'lower than expected' detail particularly compelling - it provides at least weak evidence that preliminary indicators suggested strength that the advance estimate may have missed.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I believe my initial 35% was slightly too conservative. The combination of (1) the advance estimate being only 0.3 percentage points from the threshold, (2) the article noting it was 'lower than expected' which suggests some market expectation of positive growth, and (3) normal GDP revisions being substantial enough to easily encompass a 0.3+ pp swing, all argue for somewhat higher probability than I initially assigned. However, I remain cautious about going as high as 45% because: the advance estimate represents the BEA's best assessment with available data at the time, there's no specific evidence of systematic underestimation or data collection issues, and revisions don't systematically favor one direction. The absence of information about the second estimate (which would have been released in late May, before today's date of June 5) is notable - if available, it would provide a crucial signal. Balancing these factors, I'm updating to 40%, which appropriately weights both the status quo negative reading and the meaningful possibility of upward revision given the thin margin and market expectations context.",
