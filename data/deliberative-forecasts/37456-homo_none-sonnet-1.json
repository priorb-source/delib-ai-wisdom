    "review": "The other forecasters raised several compelling points I hadn't fully weighted. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the perishable nature of liquid eggs is particularly relevant - short shelf life means contaminated product is likely already consumed or disposed of, potentially accelerating the recall closure process. Forecaster 3's specific reference to typical USDA/FSIS recall timelines (60-180 days) provides valuable quantitative context that suggests 95 days falls comfortably within normal ranges rather than representing an aggressive timeline. Both forecasters also noted the food service/institutional distribution channel characteristics, which could facilitate tracking compared to broad retail distribution.\n\nHowever, I'm also struck by a point both implicitly acknowledged: 40 days have already elapsed without apparent progress toward closure. This suggests the process isn't moving particularly rapidly. The lack of any information about corrective actions, verification progress, or FSIS statements indicating movement toward closure after 40 days is somewhat concerning if we're expecting closure within the next 55 days.\n\nThe consensus clustering around 42-43% suggests my initial 30% may have been overly cautious, but I'm not fully convinced to move to that range given the elapsed time without visible progress.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe the perishability argument deserves more weight than I initially assigned. Liquid eggs have substantially shorter shelf lives than many recalled products, which genuinely facilitates faster product removal from commerce. Additionally, the 60-180 day typical range for USDA recalls suggests that 95 days isn't at the extreme short end - it's within plausible territory.\n\nHowever, I remain concerned about the information vacuum after 40 days of elapsed time. If this recall were on a fast track toward closure by July 1, we might expect some indicators of progress by now. The status quo bias - that bureaucratic processes move slowly and recalls tend to remain open longer than initially expected - still carries significant weight.\n\nBalancing these considerations, I'm updating upward from my initial 30% to account for the perishability factor and the reasonable timeline, but not moving all the way to the 42-43% range given the lack of progress indicators and continuing strength of status quo bias. A modest upward adjustment to approximately 37% reflects incorporating the valid points about product characteristics while maintaining appropriate caution about regulatory process timelines.",
