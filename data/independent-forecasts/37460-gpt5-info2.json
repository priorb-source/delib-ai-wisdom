  "information": "On May 1, 2025, Labor Day events in Istanbul included authorized marches and unauthorized protests. According to the Istanbul Governor's Office, authorized marches in the Kadıköy and Kartal districts had a combined participation of around 65,000 people. Authorities deployed over 52,000 police officers. Clashes occurred during attempts to hold unauthorized demonstrations, particularly near Taksim Square, leading to the detention of 384 people. A court later ordered the release of 374 of those detained, while others were released on bail or remained in custody.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of today, the Global Protest Tracker has not yet listed a Türkiye event meeting the criteria.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Carnegie’s Global Protest Tracker does not add a new Türkiye entry with 10,000+ participants before July 1, 2025; the May 1 Labor Day events are not added, and no subsequent protest of that size is added in time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Tracker adds an entry for the May 1, 2025 Labor Day protests in Istanbul (authorized marches totaling ~65,000 by official figures) or for another large protest (≥10,000) starting before July 1, and the entry is published on the Tracker by that date.",
    "rationale": "Key fact from the assistant’s report: On May 1, 2025, Istanbul’s authorized Labor Day marches in Kadıköy and Kartal drew a combined ~65,000 participants per the Governor’s Office; 52,000 police were deployed; 384 people were detained amid clashes near Taksim. This comfortably exceeds the 10,000 threshold if Carnegie chooses to list it.\n\nCrucial uncertainty is not whether a large protest occurred (it did), but whether the Global Protest Tracker will include it and do so by July 1. The Tracker is curated and selective, often emphasizing distinct anti-government protest movements rather than routine, annually recurring demonstrations like May Day, unless they are unusually salient. While this year’s May Day in Istanbul drew significant numbers and saw a notable crackdown, Carnegie does not consistently add annual May Day events across countries. Timing also matters: even if they decide to include it, publication could lag past July 1.\n\nAdditional paths to “Yes” exist (e.g., large anti-government or labor protests in late May/June, or a sizable late-June event such as Pride-related mobilization if it swells despite restrictions). However, recent years’ bans and dispersals in central Istanbul often cap attendance below 10,000 for such events. On balance, the modal outcome is that no qualifying new Turkey entry appears on the Tracker by July 1.\n\nWhy not higher: (1) Carnegie’s selectivity and tendency not to catalog routine annual May Day protests; (2) uncertain and sometimes slow update cadence; (3) possibility the question launched after May 1, which would disqualify that start date. Why not lower: (1) The May 1 event clearly meets the size bar and received international coverage due to the crackdown, increasing chances of inclusion; (2) Turkey’s protest environment is dynamic, and another ≥10,000 event before July 1 is plausible.\n\nWhat would move me up: Evidence Carnegie has recently added comparable one-off/annual protests; signs they updated Turkey entries post–May 1; confirmation that the question launched before May 1; reports of another large (≥10k) protest starting before July 1. What would move me down: No Tracker updates for weeks; explicit indication the Tracker will not add May Day-type events; confirmation the question launched after May 1; cooling protest activity and continued successful preemptive bans/fragmentation keeping turnout under 10k.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 Turkish protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Turkish_protests)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
