    "review": "My initial forecast of 75% for 'Yes' was based on the high statistical bar for any single topic to remain on the front page of two major newspapers for over 30 consecutive days. Forecaster 2 (28%) presents a compelling counterargument, emphasizing that the different angles of the NYT and WSJ, combined with the structural format of the WSJ's 'What's News' section, make a simultaneous omission on the same day difficult. This highlights a structural bias towards a 'No' outcome that I had underestimated. Forecaster 3 (70%) aligns closely with my initial logic but introduces a crucial new argument: the 'synonym effect.' The resolution criteria require the literal word 'tariff(s),' and journalists may easily use synonyms like 'duties' or 'levies,' creating a 'clean day' even if the topic is covered. This is a powerful point in favor of a 'Yes' outcome. Forecaster 3 also correctly emphasizes that the EU tariff deadline being pushed to July 9, after the resolution window, substantially lowers the day-to-day news urgency in June.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 75% to 65%. The arguments presented by the other forecasters have introduced two significant, opposing factors that require me to recalibrate my confidence. Forecaster 2's point about the structural formats of the papers and the difficulty of achieving a *simultaneous* omission is a strong argument for 'No' that I had not fully weighted. The observation that the word has appeared daily from May 20-25 provides concrete evidence of its current high salience. This pulls my forecast down. However, Forecaster 3's point about the 'synonym effect' is a powerful counterweight that strongly favors 'Yes.' The strict, literal wording of the resolution is a critical detail. The delayed EU deadline also remains a key factor suggesting coverage will wane in June. My updated forecast of 65% reflects my continued belief that a 'Yes' outcome is more likely than not, but it incorporates the increased probability of a 'No' outcome due to the high salience and the structural challenge of a simultaneous, same-day omission across both papers. The 10-point drop acknowledges the strength of the bear case presented by Forecaster 2.",
