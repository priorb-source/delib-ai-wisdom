  "information": "Recent activity shows a shift in the priorities and communication styles of both Elon Musk and Donald Trump. An analysis of Musk's posts on X revealed that his content has shifted away from U.S. government and politics, with only 19% of his posts in May being on these topics compared to 51% in February. He is now posting more about his business ventures, including space travel, electric vehicles, and AI. Meanwhile, Donald Trump primarily uses Truth Social for his communications, with reports noting that posts from his account on X are rare.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~40 days (until the July 1, 2025 check)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Neither Musk nor Trump uses the exact phrase “diversity visa” on X before July 1, 2025. Trump continues posting primarily on Truth Social and campaign channels, and any immigration-related posts on X avoid that exact wording (e.g., “visa lottery,” “DV lottery”). Musk continues focusing on business/AI/tech and, if he comments on immigration, he uses different phrasing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A short, salient immigration news cycle (policy proposal, court case, or viral DV-lottery story) prompts either Musk to comment on X or Trump/campaign staff to cross-post to X with the exact phrase “diversity visa,” possibly in a reply or quote-post. Alternatively, Musk reacts to a post from an account he follows that uses the phrase and repeats it directly.",
    "rationale": "There is roughly 40 days left until Metaculus checks for the phrase. The resolution criteria require the exact words “diversity visa” to appear in an X post from @realdonaldtrump or @elonmusk. The assistant-provided research indicates Musk’s political/government posting share dropped from 51% (Feb) to 19% (May), with a shift toward business and AI, and that Trump’s X posts are rare as he primarily uses Truth Social. Those are both strong base-rate signals against a match within a short window. The exact-phrase constraint is another meaningful brake—both figures may discuss immigration but often use alternative terms (“visa lottery,” “DV lottery,” “immigration reform,” or DEI, which is unrelated). The linked recent tweet from an account followed by Musk modestly raises the chance he might echo the terminology, but his current focus and the specificity of the phrase keep the likelihood low. There’s a minor complication in the prompt header mentioning April 1, 2025, but the operative resolution text specifies July 1, 2025; I am basing timing on that explicit criterion. Why not higher? Limited time, low current topical focus for Musk, Trump’s infrequent use of X, and the need for the exact phrase all reduce odds. Why not lower? Musk is highly active and occasionally reacts to viral posts about immigration; a single reply containing the exact phrase would suffice. Trump could also cross-post immigration talking points (he has historically criticized the DV lottery), and a campaign or policy beat could surface the term. What would move me up: evidence that either is engaging with DV-lottery content (e.g., recent posts using “visa lottery”/“diversity lottery”), Musk replying to or quote-posting a DV tweet, a policy news spike about the DV program, or signs Trump has resumed regular posting on X. What would move me down: another 2–3 weeks with no immigration/DV mentions from either, clear continued avoidance of X by Trump, or Musk staying strictly on business/AI topics.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**. If not, it resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nRecent activity shows a shift in the priorities and communication styles of both Elon Musk and Donald Trump.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
