    "review": "Forecaster 2’s key claim that reporting points to “later in 2025” conflicts with the assistant’s cited Cursor-IDE and ZDNet pieces indicating late May/early June targeting. Without a specific citation, I don’t find the “later in 2025” assertion persuasive. Their argument about complex safety work and likely delays is reasonable in general, but it doesn’t outweigh the near-term signals we have. They also seem to overstate the likelihood that public access would be waitlisted; Anthropic’s recent launches often had at least one generally available tier day-one.\nForecaster 3 rightly emphasizes time pressure and the lack of official announcement. The cadence argument cuts both ways: Anthropic released Claude 3.5 mid-2024 and could plausibly target mid-2025 for a 4.x family. Their note that Anthropic can move from announcement to GA quickly is important; 46 days is ample if the model is already in red-team. The absence of public hints would normally be concerning, but the assistant’s report provides some, albeit not official.\nNet: F2’s “later in 2025” point isn’t convincing without sourcing; F3’s timing caution is valid and nudges me slightly down for schedule and naming/gating risk.",
    "rationale": "I still weight the assistant’s report (Neptune finishing red-team ~May 18, GA late May/early June) as the strongest signal, consistent with Anthropic’s history of short announce-to-availability lags and making at least one tier broadly accessible. However, I’m moderating for three risks: (1) naming—resolution requires “Claude 4” in the public model name; Anthropic could brand as 3.7 or “Neptune” without a ‘4’; (2) access gating—initial release could be enterprise/partner-only or behind a waitlist; (3) schedule slippage—red-team or safety concerns could push GA into July. The lack of an official pre-announcement today modestly increases slippage risk.\nQuantitatively, I roughly factor: release by July 1 ~0.75–0.8; “Claude 4” naming ~0.7–0.8; immediate public access (no waitlist) ~0.8–0.9. Multiplying midpoints yields ~0.55–0.6. That’s lower than my initial 70%, primarily due to acknowledging greater naming and gating risks and the possibility the late-May window slips.\nI will update higher on any official Anthropic announcement using the “Claude 4” name or documentation/screenshots showing “Claude 4” on claude.ai/API without a waitlist. I will update lower if we reach late May without signals, if the branding omits ‘4,’ or if initial access is limited to waitlisted/enterprise users.",
