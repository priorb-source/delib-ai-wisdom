  "information": "Colombia has declared a national health emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, there have been 79 reported cases and 36 deaths since 2024, with the departments of Tolima and Putumayo being the most affected. The government has implemented mobility restrictions in high-risk areas and vaccination requirements for travelers. In response to rising cases in South America, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a level 2 travel notice for the continent, citing spread to newly affected areas in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.\n\nThe Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert in early April 2025 due to an increase in yellow fever cases in the Americas. In the first three months of 2025, 131 human cases and 53 deaths were confirmed in the region, primarily in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This case count is more than double the total for all of 2024. Separately, the United Nations has warned that global aid funding cuts are disrupting child vaccination programs at a level similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to a rise in yellow fever cases after years of decline.\n\nSeveral countries near the outbreak zones have implemented preventive measures. Panama has activated health protocols, although it has not reported a human case since 1974 and has vaccination coverage of over 95% in high-risk areas. Ecuador has also activated protocols and is conducting preventive vaccination campaigns. Costa Rica has made the yellow fever vaccine mandatory for travelers arriving from 43 countries, including many in South America, as of March 11, 2025, due to the presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector in the country.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks, from April 24, 2025, until the resolution date of June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, no country in North America has a CDC yellow fever travel advisory. The relevant CDC advisories concern countries in South America and Africa.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The yellow fever outbreaks in South America are successfully contained and do not spread northward. Preventive measures, such as vaccination requirements and health protocols in countries like Panama and Costa Rica, prove effective. No locally transmitted cases are reported in any North American country, and therefore the CDC does not issue a travel advisory by June 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The severe outbreak in Colombia spreads across the border into Panama or another Central American country. Despite preventative measures, an infected traveler or mosquito leads to a cluster of locally transmitted cases. The situation is identified and reported rapidly, prompting the CDC to issue a travel health notice for the affected North American country before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong tendency of the status quo to persist over short timeframes, balanced against the significant, proximate risk from the South American outbreak. The primary factor supporting a 'No' outcome is the short duration until resolution—just over one month. For a 'Yes' outcome, the virus would need to be introduced to a North American country, establish local transmission, be detected by health authorities, and then trigger a CDC advisory, all within this brief window. Furthermore, countries bordering the outbreak zone, such as Panama and Costa Rica, have implemented robust countermeasures including health protocols and traveler vaccination requirements. Panama's high vaccination coverage in at-risk areas and its success in preventing yellow fever since 1974 are strong mitigating factors. However, the probability is not zero due to the unprecedented scale of the ongoing outbreaks in Colombia, Peru, and Brazil, as highlighted by PAHO. The presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector throughout much of Central America and Mexico means local transmission is possible if the virus is introduced. The CDC has already demonstrated its vigilance by issuing a Level 2 notice for South America, suggesting it would act quickly if confirmed cases emerged further north. My forecast of 5% reflects a small but non-trivial risk that these defensive lines could be breached, leading to a rapid chain of events resulting in an advisory. I would increase my forecast if there are credible reports of confirmed human cases in any Central American country. I would decrease it if the South American outbreaks show clear signs of containment.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
