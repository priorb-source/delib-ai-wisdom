    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a clear base-rate framing and notes that any administration intent to remove such a high-profile site would likely have shown clearer signals by now; they also flag government shutdown risk, which is minimal around July 1. Forecaster 3 emphasizes the short time horizon and bureaucratic inertia but assigns more weight to political risk from climate data removal. I agree with both on strong institutional inertia and the short window. I find 98% a bit too high given single-source resolution risk (a transient outage at the moment Metaculus checks) and low-probability technical/cyber issues. I find 87% too low because it likely overweights political removal while underweighting that even if content changes, the domain typically remains reachable (often via redirect), which would still count as UP.",
    "rationale": "Climate.gov is currently up, and only ~6 weeks remain. Historical precedent strongly favors domain persistence even amid content changes. A deliberate decommissioning before July 1 would likely be telegraphed and, even then, often preserves domain reachability via redirects. The resolution’s “on or after July 1” further reduces the chance that a transient outage drives a No. Residual risks include a targeted takedown, a cyber incident, DNS/SSL misconfiguration, or an unlucky transient outage coinciding with the single check by the resolver. Given the absence of signals of decommissioning and low seasonal shutdown risk, I slightly raise my estimate to reflect the strong status quo and short timeline while retaining some buffer for low-probability technical/political events.",
