  "information": "The weakness of the Japanese yen poses a challenge to tourism in the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI), as Japanese travelers tend to prefer non-U.S. dollar destinations. Japanese visitor numbers to the CNMI were 7,762 in 2023 and 13,779 in 2024, with the increase largely due to cruise ship arrivals. In response, United Airlines has launched a digital advertising campaign for its Narita-Saipan route, and the Marianas Visitors Authority has partnered with Japanese travel agencies. The islands also received diving awards at the 'Marine Diving Fair 2025' in Tokyo, highlighting their appeal. Separately, Hong Kong Airlines lists Saipan as one of its destinations, and travel platform Expedia noted a significant increase in search volume for Saipan from Hong Kong travelers.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (4 or fewer direct destinations listed on FlightsFrom for SPN)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Saipan shows only Guam, Tokyo-Narita, and Seoul-Incheon (and possibly one more like Hong Kong) on FlightsFrom as of July 1; no additional summer routes are loaded or previously planned services slip/cancel.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "By July 1 FlightsFrom lists at least five: e.g., Guam (GUM), Tokyo-Narita (NRT), Seoul-Incheon (ICN), Hong Kong (HKG), plus one more such as Busan (PUS), Osaka-Kansai (KIX), or Manila (MNL), via either scheduled seasonal services or loaded charters.",
    "rationale": "Baseline inertia points to ≤4 destinations. Saipan’s air network has been thin post-pandemic and reliant on a few core markets: Guam (United), Japan (United NRT), and Korea (LCCs to ICN). Adding enough routes to reach >4 by early July would likely require either multiple Korean secondary-city summer services or a new Hong Kong/Manila route plus retention of all existing ones. The research assistant notes: (1) weak Japanese yen dampening Japan demand; (2) United marketing NRT–SPN and MVA promotions (supportive for maintaining Japan but not necessarily expanding beyond it quickly); (3) Hong Kong Airlines lists Saipan and searches from Hong Kong have risen (an upside catalyst if HKG–SPN is actually loaded and operating by July); and (4) awards/marketing in Japan (helpful but unlikely to flip network breadth within weeks). Headwinds include Japan’s currency-driven softness, the end of CNMI’s prior China visa-parole program limiting PRC demand, and airlines’ general caution. Upside exists because summer is peak season and Korean LCCs sometimes add short-term seasonal routes; if Hong Kong Airlines starts HKG–SPN before July and one additional Korean secondary city (e.g., Busan) is loaded, the count could hit 5. Why not higher: to beat 4, Saipan likely needs two additions if it currently sits at three destinations; timing is tight and announcements usually appear weeks in advance. Why not lower: visible interest from Hong Kong and active marketing raise chances of at least one additional route for summer. What would move me up: confirmed timetable loading on FlightsFrom/OAG for HKG–SPN or any added Korean/Japanese city (PUS, KIX, NGO) operating in July; press releases with start dates before July 1. What would move me down: signs of reduced frequency or suspension on NRT or ICN, or lack of any loaded HKG service by mid-June.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
