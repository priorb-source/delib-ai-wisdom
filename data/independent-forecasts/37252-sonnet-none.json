    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (from May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - protests do not reach the 10,000+ threshold or are not captured by the Global Protest Tracker",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The political crisis that triggered the December 2024 martial law and protests has stabilized. Either the government made sufficient concessions, leadership changes occurred, or protest fatigue set in. While smaller demonstrations may continue, they don't reach the 10,000+ participant threshold, or the Global Protest Tracker doesn't capture them in their reporting for this period.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Political tensions remain elevated or a new triggering event occurs. Ongoing impeachment proceedings, government actions perceived as authoritarian, or economic grievances spark large-scale demonstrations. South Korea's strong protest tradition and recent mobilization capacity (demonstrated in December 2024) translate into at least one protest with 10,000+ participants that the Global Protest Tracker reports.",
    "rationale": "The December 2024 martial law declaration and subsequent anti-government protests indicate serious political instability in South Korea and demonstrate the population's willingness and capacity to mobilize in large numbers. However, five months have passed since that crisis (December 2024 to May 2025), which creates significant uncertainty about current conditions. Status quo bias suggests that after the initial crisis response, situations often stabilize or protest momentum wanes. Without current information about ongoing protest activity or the resolution status of the political crisis, I must balance several factors: (1) South Korea has a robust democratic tradition with history of successful mass protests, (2) the severity of a martial law declaration suggests deep political divisions that don't resolve quickly, (3) the relatively short 2-month forecast window means recent events are still temporally relevant, but (4) the passage of 5 months allows time for either resolution or protest fatigue. The specific requirement that the Global Protest Tracker must report these protests adds uncertainty - not all protests, even large ones, may be captured in their database. My forecast is not higher because we lack evidence of ongoing large-scale protest activity as of May 2025, suggesting possible stabilization. It's not lower because the recent demonstration of mobilization capacity and the typical persistence of political crises make large protests reasonably plausible within a 2-month window. To revise upward, I would need evidence of: ongoing political crisis, recent medium-sized protests, or new triggering events. To revise downward: evidence of political resolution, declining protest activity, or government concessions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in South Korea with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nACLED December 2024: [South Korea: Anti-government protests surge following martial law declaration](https://acleddata.com/2025/01/15/asia-pacific-overview-january-2025/#keytrends6)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in South Korea with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
