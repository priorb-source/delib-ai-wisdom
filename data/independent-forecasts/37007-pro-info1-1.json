  "information": "The People's National Movement (PNM) is the incumbent party, having won the 2020 general election with 21 out of 41 seats. The main opposition, the United National Congress (UNC), won the remaining 19 seats. The country uses a first-past-the-post electoral system. Historically, the PNM has won the majority of general elections held since the year 2000.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 7-9 days. The election is on April 28, 2025, and official results are typically confirmed within a day or two.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The incumbent People's National Movement (PNM) wins the most seats, continuing their governance, consistent with their victory in the 2020 election and their historical electoral success.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The United National Congress (UNC) capitalizes on voter discontent over economic conditions or public services, successfully flipping a small number of marginal seats previously held by the PNM, thereby winning a plurality of seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The PNM leverages its incumbency advantage and maintains its support in key constituencies, holding its 2020 seats and potentially gaining one, thus securing a clear plurality and another term in government.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily anchored on the significant advantage of incumbency and the People's National Movement's (PNM) historical performance. As the governing party that won the 2020 election, the PNM represents the status quo, which often has a higher probability than change. The research indicates the PNM has won most general elections since 2000, establishing a strong base rate of success. The first-past-the-post system also tends to favor established incumbents.\n\nHowever, this confidence is tempered by the narrow margin of victory in 2020, where the PNM won 21 seats to the United National Congress's (UNC) 19. This demonstrates that the election is highly competitive. A small swing in voter preference in just a few marginal constituencies could easily alter the outcome. For the UNC to win a plurality, they only need to flip two seats from the PNM's column. This makes the election highly sensitive to on-the-ground campaign dynamics, voter turnout, and any last-minute events that could sway undecided voters.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the slim majority from the last election introduces substantial uncertainty and indicates that a UNC victory is a very plausible outcome. A small shift in public mood could be decisive. My forecast is not lower than 50% because, in the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary (like consistent polling showing a UNC lead or a major scandal), the incumbency advantage and historical precedent make the PNM the marginal favorite. \n\nI would increase my probability for a 'Yes' outcome if credible late-stage polls showed a stable or widening lead for the PNM, particularly in key marginals. Conversely, I would decrease my probability if there were reports of a significant loss of public confidence in the current government or polling data indicating a swing towards the UNC.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
