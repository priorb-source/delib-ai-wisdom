    "rationale": "- Summary of known info: YC’s AI Startup School is June 16–17, 2025 in San Francisco for ~2,000 top AI students; YC offers up to $500 travel; Sam Altman and Elon Musk are announced headline speakers. No public agenda indicating a joint session has been released as of May 27, 2025.\n- Base-rate view: At major tech conferences, multiple headliners are usually given separate keynotes or fireside chats. Unless a joint session is explicitly promoted, the default is separate appearances. That pushes the status quo toward “No.”\n- Relationship dynamics: Altman and Musk are direct rivals (OpenAI vs. xAI), with a history of public criticism and past litigation. That lowers the likelihood they agree to a shared stage absent a pre-arranged, clearly framed debate. YC is closely associated with Altman, which may further decrease Musk’s appetite for a joint appearance on YC’s turf.\n- Logistics/operational risk: Musk’s attendance at conferences can be fluid; travel/schedule/security issues increase the chance of a no-show or format change (e.g., remote), which would preclude sharing a physical stage. \n- What could make “Yes” happen: YC might engineer a marquee “Altman + Musk” dialogue to maximize buzz for students. If such a session is announced (even late) or teased by YC/Elon/Sam, odds jump sharply. A surprise joint closing/opening is also possible but less common at YC-style events.\n- Why not higher: No joint session has been advertised yet; rivalry and incentives make cooperation less likely; base-rate of ad-hoc top-tier joint appearances is low.\n- Why not lower: Both are confirmed headliners at the same two-day, single-venue conference; YC may value a headline-grabbing moment; Musk sometimes embraces high-visibility debates.\n- Update triggers:\n  • Up: Official agenda or credible report lists a joint panel; public hints from YC/Altman/Musk about appearing together; on-site schedule shows an “all-headliners” session.\n  • Down: Agenda shows strictly separate sessions; reports of remote participation by either; cancellation/absence; public indications of unwillingness to share a stage.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nY Combinator (YC) is launching its inaugural AI Startup School in San Francisco on June 16-17, 2025. The event is a free conference intended for 2,000 top AI students, researchers, and recent graduates, with YC offering up to $500 for travel expenses. The program's goal is to shape the next generation of AI startups by focusing on entrepreneurship, product building, and fundraising. YC has announced that Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the event's headline speakers.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
