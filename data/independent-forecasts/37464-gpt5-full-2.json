  "information": "LPK1, a Renton, Washington establishment, is recalling approximately 303 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken Caesar wrap products. The recall was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, as the Caesar dressing packet contains fish (anchovies) which is not declared on the product label. The recall is designated as Class II. The affected products were produced on February 15, 17, and 19, 2025. The corresponding 'best by' dates were February 21, 23, and 25, 2025, and the lot codes were LPK1WA046, LPK1WA048, and LPK1WA050.\n\nThe recalled chicken Caesar wraps were distributed to vending machines located in office buildings within the state of Washington. The labeling issue was discovered by the company during a routine quality assurance check of ingredient labels. As of early May 2025, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions or illnesses due to the consumption of these products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has urged consumers and offices not to consume or serve the products and to either return them or dispose of them.\n\nThe recall was issued on February 24, 2025. According to the FSIS recall webpage, the status of the recall remained 'Active' as of May 8, 2025. The general FSIS process for closing a recall requires verification that all affected product has been accounted for and removed from commerce, and confirmation that the company has implemented appropriate corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 23 days (until end of May 31, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the FSIS recall page remains listed as Active on June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS verification and documentation lag; the agency has not yet confirmed full product recovery and corrective actions, so the page is still Active on June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "LPK1 provides sufficient documentation showing all affected wraps were removed from commerce and labeling corrections are in place; FSIS verifies and updates the recall status to Closed in mid-to-late May.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: The recall (Class II) was issued Feb 24, 2025 for about 303 lbs of chicken Caesar wraps sold via office-building vending machines in Washington. Best-by dates were Feb 21/23/25. As of May 8, the FSIS page still shows Active; no illnesses reported. FSIS closes recalls after confirming product recovery and corrective actions.\n- Timing/base-rate sense: Small, limited, short-shelf-life recalls often close within roughly 1–4 months. We are approaching the 3-month mark by early June. The products expired in late February, suggesting removal from commerce should have been straightforward and completed long ago. The remaining gating factor is likely paperwork/verification, which can lag.\n- Status quo weighting: As of May 8 the recall is still Active. With only ~3 weeks left, the default path (no change) yields No. However, given the small scope, limited distribution, and expired product, a mid-to-late May closure is plausible.\n- Why not higher: Bureaucratic and verification delays are common; many FSIS recalls remain Active for months even after hazards are mitigated. With only ~23 days left, any delay in FSIS processing or a need for additional corrective-action evidence could push closure into June.\n- Why not lower: Scope is tiny, distribution is narrow, and the issue (undeclared anchovy in dressing) is readily addressed via labeling corrections. No illnesses have been reported, and product is long past best-by, reducing ongoing risk and supporting a timely closure.\n- What would change my view: Upward revision if FSIS posts updates on similar small recalls being closed in May, or if LPK1/FSIS note completion of corrective actions. Downward revision if the recall expands, documentation issues emerge, or FSIS updates imply ongoing verification tasks that typically take weeks.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
