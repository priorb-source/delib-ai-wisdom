    "no_outcome_scenario": "The diplomatic momentum from the late-May Franco-British initiative slows. Potential recognizing countries face internal procedural delays or successful diplomatic counter-pressure from the US or Israel, causing them to postpone an official announcement beyond June 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capitalizing on the political cover and momentum generated by the major UK-France initiative, at least one other country, likely a European nation that has previously indicated its willingness (e.g., Belgium, Malta, Slovenia), proceeds with a formal recognition announcement in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the significant new information provided in the background: a joint France-UK initiative for Palestinian state recognition announced in late May 2025. This represents a major shift in policy for the UK, a UN Security Council permanent member, and creates powerful momentum. Diplomatic recognitions of this nature often occur in waves, as seen in the real-world example of Spain, Ireland, and Norway in May 2024. The joint initiative by two major European powers provides political cover and encouragement for other nations to act. June 2025, being the month immediately following the announcement, is a very likely window for a follow-on country to act to maintain momentum.\n\nMy probability is not higher because international diplomacy is complex and subject to delays. The initiative could be a pressure tactic with a longer, unstated timeline. A significant FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) campaign by opposing nations like the US or Israel could successfully delay action past the June window. There might also be internal political debates within potential recognizing countries that slow down the official process.\n\nMy probability is not lower because dismissing this strong signal would be a mistake. A coordinated announcement by France and the UK is a watershed moment that substantially increases the likelihood of other countries acting in the short term. The status quo has been disrupted, and the path of least resistance has now shifted towards recognition for several European nations.\n\nI would increase my forecast if other potential recognizers (e.g., Belgium, Malta) issue statements in early June supporting the initiative and indicating a decision is imminent. I would decrease my forecast if the US administration publicly launches a high-profile effort to persuade allies to delay, or if France/UK clarify that their initiative is subject to conditions that cannot be met by the end of June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a UN member country newly recognize Palestine in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[UK joins France's initiative for recognition of Palestinian state](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/05/20/uk-joins-france-s-initiative-for-recognition-of-palestinian-state_6741456_4.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, a UN member country announces that it recognizes Palestine as a sovereign nation. Resolves based on Al Jazeera's [tracking page](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/10/mapping-which-countries-recognise-palestine-in-2025) or other credible sources should the tracking page not be timely updated.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
