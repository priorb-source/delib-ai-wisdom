  "information": "An executive order signed on April 2, 2025, imposes a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff' on all trade partners, with higher tariffs on certain partners. Reports since the order indicate a 'precautionary consumption' trend in the US, with consumers stockpiling goods. The arrival of container ships from China, which supplies 77% of toys sold in the US, has reportedly fallen by 50%. In March 2025, the Cortland Standard, a 147-year-old newspaper in New York, ceased publication, citing rising costs, including a 25% tariff on newsprint from Canada, as a contributing factor.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The imposition of a major new tariff regime just weeks ago makes it a dominant, ongoing news story. The status quo is that the word 'tariff(s)' will continue to appear on the front page of at least one of the two major newspapers each day.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome occurs if, on every single day from May 9, 2025, to May 31, 2025, the word 'tariff' or 'tariffs' appears on the front page of either The New York Times or the Wall Street Journal. This would happen as the economic, political, and international fallout from the new tariffs continues to generate daily headlines.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome occurs if there is at least one day between May 9, 2025, and May 31, 2025, where the word 'tariff(s)' is absent from the front pages of BOTH newspapers. This would most likely be triggered by a sudden, massive, and unrelated news event (e.g., a major natural disaster, a declaration of war, a major domestic crisis) that completely dominates the news cycle for a day.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the exceptional newsworthiness of the tariff policy described. The research indicates that on April 2, 2025, a sweeping 'minimum benchmark tariff' of 10% was levied on all trade partners. This is a monumental story with profound and continuing consequences for the economy, politics, and international relations. The reported effects—consumer stockpiling, a 50% drop in container ships from China, and even a business closure citing the tariffs—ensure this story has longevity and multiple angles for coverage. \n\nGiven the mandates of the two newspapers, it is highly probable the story will persist. The Wall Street Journal, as the nation's premier business paper, will almost certainly provide daily front-page coverage of the market impact. The New York Times will cover the significant political and diplomatic fallout. For the story to be absent from BOTH front pages on the same day requires a complete news cycle takeover by another event. The status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome, as major stories with such deep impact have significant inertia.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 10 because the 23-day window allows for the possibility of an unforeseen, exogenous shock—a 'black swan' event so large it temporarily displaces all other news. My forecast is not higher because this would underestimate the sheer gravity of this tariff story. The bar for a 'Yes' resolution—a total absence of the term from both front pages—is exceptionally high in the current news environment. I would update my forecast higher if the administration signaled a reversal of the policy, and lower if a major trade war escalation occurred.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff(s)\" disappear from the front print pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal by June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\n\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. When, if ever, will we seen tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve to \"Yes\" if, after \\[OPEN DATE] and before June 1, 2025, the words, \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\", do not appear on the print front page of The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\nGrammar is not relevant (e.g. \"TARIFF\" will suffice to prevent a \"No\" resolution).\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, it does not have to be in a title.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAn executive order signed on April 2, 2025, imposes a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff' on all trade partners, with higher tariffs on certain partners.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
