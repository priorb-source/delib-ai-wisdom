  "information": "Incumbent Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, in office since 2003, has commenced his 2026 re-election campaign. He has secured endorsements from prominent party figures, including former President Donald Trump, Governor Henry McMaster, and Senator Tim Scott. On the Democratic side, Dr. Annie Andrews, a pediatrician who ran for a House seat in 2022, announced on May 29, 2025, that she would be a candidate in the 2026 Senate race.\n\nAccording to news reports from February and March 2025, U.S. Representative Ralph Norman is \"seriously considering\" a run for Governor of South Carolina in 2026, when the incumbent will be term-limited. Several outlets, including The State, Roll Call, and Politico, have noted that Norman's office has denied any plans for a Senate run. Norman has officially filed for his own House re-election.\n\nAs of late May 2025, there was no publicly available evidence of preparatory activities for a Senate campaign by Ralph Norman. Reports indicated an absence of actions typically preceding a major campaign launch, such as filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for a statement of candidacy, the formation of an exploratory committee, significant staff hires, or major donor activity. The official filing period for the 2026 South Carolina primary does not open until the spring of 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Ralph Norman is a sitting US Representative who has officially filed for his own House re-election and has shown no public signs of preparing for a US Senate campaign.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ralph Norman continues to focus on his House duties and his reported consideration of a 2026 gubernatorial run. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without him making any public announcement or official filing to run for the US Senate.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite previous denials and a focus on the governor's race, a sudden shift in political calculation, such as new polling data or a major misstep by the incumbent, prompts Norman to pivot. He makes an unexpected, formal declaration of his candidacy for the Senate before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The evidence overwhelmingly points towards a 'No' outcome. First, the deadline is just one month away, which is an exceptionally short timeframe to launch a credible primary challenge against a well-funded, long-term incumbent like Lindsey Graham. Major campaigns require months of preparation, including fundraising, staff hiring, and FEC filings, none of which are evident according to the research. Second, Norman's own office has publicly denied any plans for a Senate run, and multiple media outlets report his focus is on the 2026 South Carolina gubernatorial race. Third, Senator Graham has already secured high-profile endorsements from key figures like Donald Trump, Senator Tim Scott, and Governor Henry McMaster, creating a formidable barrier to entry for any primary challenger. My forecast is not lower than 5% because political circumstances can change rapidly, and a surprise announcement remains a remote possibility. However, the probability is not higher because the complete lack of logistical groundwork, combined with public denials and a stated focus on a different office, makes a Senate campaign launch in the next 30 days highly improbable.",
