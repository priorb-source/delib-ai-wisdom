    "review": "My initial forecast of 25% was critically flawed as it was made without the most important piece of recent information, which Forecaster 2 provided: the new $100 million financing facility secured on May 7, 2025. Forecaster 2's analysis is highly convincing because this new capital directly addresses the primary short-term risk—a liquidity crisis. Their argument that no rational entity would provide such financing if bankruptcy were imminent is decisive. Forecaster 3's reasoning was sound and similar to my initial thoughts, focusing on the short timeline and the nature of bankruptcy as a last resort. However, their analysis was also missing the key financing information, and they themselves noted that such a deal would cause them to lower their forecast. The consensus forming around a very low probability is therefore well-supported by this new evidence.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward from 25% to 5%. The primary reason for this change is the new information, highlighted by Forecaster 2, that Beyond Meat secured a $100 million senior secured financing facility on May 7, 2025. This event fundamentally alters the company's short-term liquidity position. Combined with their existing cash of approximately $116 million, the company now has a liquidity runway of over $200 million. Given a monthly cash burn in the range of $13 million to $15 million, this is more than sufficient to fund operations well beyond the July 1, 2025 resolution date. The financing provides a strong signal that both management and its new lenders do not anticipate a bankruptcy filing in the immediate future. My previous forecast was based on the high risk of a rapid liquidity crunch given the company's negative gross margins and significant operating losses. This new financing directly mitigates that specific risk for the forecast period. I am not lowering my forecast to 0% because, as both other forecasters noted, the company remains financially distressed. A residual risk exists from unforeseen events, such as a major product recall, a fraud discovery, or a technical breach of loan covenants, which could force a sudden filing. A 5% probability appropriately accounts for these low-probability but high-impact tail risks.",
