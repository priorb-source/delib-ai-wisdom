    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month (resolves on July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Senator John Fetterman continues to serve as a U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania and caucus with the Senate Democrats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite media reports of friction and his occasional policy disagreements with the Democratic party line, Senator Fetterman continues to caucus with the Democrats through the resolution date. He values the committee assignments and institutional power that come with being part of the majority caucus, and he continues to vote with the party on most key issues, deciding that remaining within the tent is more effective than leaving it.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either due to a sudden and severe health setback that forces him to step down, or due to an escalating conflict with Democratic leadership, Senator Fetterman announces his resignation from the Senate. Alternatively, following a particularly sharp policy disagreement, he could announce he is officially changing his affiliation to Independent and will no longer caucus with the Democrats, seeking to operate as a completely free agent in the Senate.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the extremely high institutional inertia for sitting senators. Party switching or mid-term resignations are very rare events. The status quo, in which a senator serves out their term with the party they were elected under, is the overwhelmingly likely outcome. \n\nSenator Fetterman has directly addressed the speculation and stated he will not resign, as reported in the provided background materials. This is a strong piece of evidence against a 'Yes' outcome. While the articles highlight his isolation and policy divergences, particularly on foreign policy, these are not typically sufficient catalysts for a senator to abandon their caucus. The benefits of caucusing with the majority party—including committee assignments, legislative influence, and institutional support—are substantial and difficult to give up. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 3% because of two specific factors concerning Senator Fetterman. First, his documented, significant health history introduces a non-trivial tail risk of a resignation for medical reasons, a risk that is higher for him than for the average senator. Second, his demonstrated willingness to publicly and pointedly defy his party's progressive wing makes a politically-motivated, though unlikely, break more plausible than it would be for a more conventional politician. The combination of these two factors—a latent health risk and a maverick political style—justifies a probability slightly above the baseline for a generic senator. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 3% because a full break with the caucus remains a radical step. There is currently no concrete evidence of Fetterman taking preparatory steps for such a move, and he has explicitly denied the possibility of resignation. For the outcome to be 'Yes' in the next month, a significant and unforeseen event would need to occur. \n\nI would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of a serious deterioration in his health or if he made a public ultimatum to Democratic leadership threatening to leave the caucus over a specific issue. I would decrease it if the news cycle moves on and he makes public statements reaffirming his commitment to working within the Democratic caucus.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
