  "information": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney formally invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the G7 summit scheduled for June 15-17, 2025, in Kananaskis, Alberta. The invitation was extended in March 2025. On May 27, 2025, Zelenskyy confirmed his intention to go, stating to Ukrainian journalists, \"G7: I was invited by the Canadian Prime Minister Carney. And I will be.\" Canadian security planning documents list Zelenskyy among the expected attendees, prompting preparations including a no-fly-zone over the area.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12 days, as the summit is scheduled for June 15-17, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. President Zelenskyy has publicly accepted the invitation and Canadian authorities are making security preparations for his arrival. Barring any unforeseen events, he will attend.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and severe escalation in the war in Ukraine, such as a major Russian offensive or a crisis in Kyiv, requires President Zelenskyy's presence in his country, forcing him to cancel his trip at the last minute.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The military and security situation in Ukraine remains stable enough to permit travel, and President Zelenskyy follows through on his public commitment to attend, arriving in Kananaskis for the summit as planned.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is heavily weighted towards 'Yes' based on multiple high-confidence indicators. The status quo is strong; leaders who publicly accept invitations to major summits typically attend. The research shows a formal invitation from the Canadian Prime Minister, an explicit and recent public statement of acceptance from President Zelenskyy ('And I will be'), and concrete logistical and security preparations by the host nation. These factors create a powerful momentum towards attendance. The probability is not higher than 90% due to the significant, ever-present uncertainty of the war in Ukraine. As a wartime president, Zelenskyy's plans are always contingent on the battlefield situation. A sudden military crisis would supersede any diplomatic engagement and is the primary reason he might cancel. A specific, credible security threat to his travel is a secondary but non-trivial risk. The probability is not lower because his public commitment is a strong signal of intent and of his government's assessment that the trip is both feasible and strategically important. For me to update this forecast higher, we would need to see confirmation of his departure from Ukraine. For me to update lower, there would need to be credible reports of a major Russian military breakthrough or a significant security incident in a major Ukrainian city that would demand his immediate attention.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Volodymyr Zelenskyy attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCalgary Herald: [Prime Minister Carney invites Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to G7 summit in Kananaskis](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/pm-mark-carney-invites-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-g7-summit-kananaskis)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney formally invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the G7 summit scheduled for June 15-17, 2025, in Kananaskis, Alberta.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
