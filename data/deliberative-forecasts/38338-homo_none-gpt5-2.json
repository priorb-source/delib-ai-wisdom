    "review": "Both analyses closely mirror my priors: short window, early timing for a 2026 race, Morgan’s history of flirtation without declaring, and lack of concrete imminence signals. I agree with their emphasis on the status quo and the absence of a forcing deadline. Forecaster 3’s 30% leans a bit high to me given no visible pre-launch indicators (staff hires, venue holds, filings, media advisories). Quarter-end optics are a real but weak catalyst here. No new evidence was introduced that materially shifts my view.",
    "rationale": "We have about three weeks left. For a 2026 gubernatorial race, June 2025 is early; typical announcements cluster later in 2025 or early 2026. Morgan’s track record favors deliberation and public musing without quick commitment. Since the May 15 Politico piece, there’s been no follow-on reporting of a scheduled event, formal filings, senior hires, or other pre-launch tells—signals I’d expect if a June rollout were imminent. As a wealthy potential self-funder, he could announce on short notice, and quarter-end (June 30) provides a plausible window, which keeps the probability from being very low. But with no concrete indicators and no hard deadline before July 1, the status quo still dominates. I therefore hold my prior estimate.",
