    "review": "The other forecasters provide excellent and complementary analyses that sharpen the key drivers of this forecast. Forecaster 2's analysis closely mirrors my own, highlighting the tension between the 'No' status quo and the high base rate of US billionaires, ultimately weighting the status quo slightly more heavily to arrive at 35%. Forecaster 3 provides two particularly valuable contributions: first, a quantitative estimate for the base rate of any mid-tier rank being held by a US citizen (35-45%), which helps anchor the forecast; and second, a sophisticated argument that strong US market performance could counterintuitively reduce the probability of a 'Yes' outcome by pushing US billionaires higher up the list. Both analyses are convincing and confirm that the core of the problem is weighing a weak status-quo signal against a strong base-rate probability amid high volatility over a short timeframe.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 40%. My initial reasoning, which balanced the status quo against the high proportion of US billionaires, is strongly validated by the other forecasters. In particular, Forecaster 3's estimate that the baseline probability of a US citizen holding a rank in this range is 35-45% gives me higher confidence that my initial 40% forecast is well-calibrated, as it falls directly in the middle of this range. While Forecaster 2 weighs the April 30th 'No' outcome more heavily, I agree with Forecaster 3 that over a 33-day period, the high churn and volatility at this rank diminish the predictive power of that single data point. The most insightful new point was Forecaster 3's argument about market outperformance potentially moving US billionaires *out* of the #250 spot. However, I assess this effect as largely symmetrical; relative underperformance could just as easily push more Americans *down* into the #250 spot. This insight therefore reinforces the high degree of uncertainty and sensitivity to market fluctuations, rather than providing a clear reason to move the forecast up or down. My 40% forecast continues to reflect a strong belief in the base rate, slightly tempered by the most recent (though weak) evidence to the contrary.",
