    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a key (new to me) claim: three leader calls on Feb 12, Mar 19, and May 10. If accurate and mutually acknowledged, that materially raises the base rate. However, the inter-call gaps (36 and 52 days) show that a 33-day lull is not unusual, so 80% seems high given the acknowledgment requirement and the fact the last call was just before the window. Forecaster 3 highlights two salient headwinds I underscored: staff-level coordination substituting for leader calls and the dual-acknowledgment hurdle. Their point about an imminent in-person meeting (Istanbul, May 15) is plausible in principle and would reduce the need for a phone call, but I’d want firmer sourcing before weighting it heavily. Both analyses sharpen the tradeoff: active diplomacy and a recent pattern argue up; possible in-person engagement and acknowledgment friction argue down.",
    "rationale": "Net, I modestly raise my forecast on the strength of the recent-call pattern, conditional on those calls being credible and (ideally) mutually acknowledged. The May 10 call being so close to the window cuts both ways: it could reduce near-term need, but it also signals active engagement likely to require follow-ups within a month. I keep a sizable discount for: (1) the requirement that both sides acknowledge the call, (2) the possibility of an in-person meeting or envoy-led channel substituting for a phone call, and (3) the non-trivial chance of a tactical pause after the May 10 conversation. I would move up on reports of scheduled or just-completed leader outreach or if an anticipated in-person meeting is canceled; I would move down on confirmed in-person talks proceeding or clear indications that communications are routed through intermediaries only.",
