    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 both explicitly state they lack data on the current tracker state, estimating ranges like '60-90' or 'below 70' as possibilities. However, my research assistant provided concrete data: 105 objectives were completed as of April 16, 2025, with 44 in progress. This is crucial information that dramatically shifts the probability calculation. From April 16 to July 1 is 76 days, requiring only 15 more completions (0.197/day) against an observed rate of 0.625/day. They raise valid concerns about early objectives being easier, verification lags, and tracker methodology, but these considerations don't outweigh the substantial mathematical buffer. Their low forecasts (40-48%) appear anchored to uncertainty about baseline data that I actually possess. However, they correctly note that one month has passed since the April 16 data point, introducing some uncertainty about the current May 16 state. If the recent pace continued, we might already be near or past 120, though we can't confirm this.",
    "rationale": "I maintain my view that the mathematical case strongly favors Yes. Starting from 105 on April 16 with 76 days remaining, we need only 0.197 objectives/day while observing 0.625/day. Even conservative scenarios support reaching 120. However, the other forecasters raise legitimate concerns I should weight more heavily: (1) verification lags - the tracker may not immediately reflect completions, (2) implementation complexity increasing over time, (3) potential political/legal obstacles that could emerge, and (4) one month of uncertainty since our last data point. The 44 'in progress' objectives remain a strong indicator of near-term completions. I'm adjusting down modestly from 87% to 83% to account for increased uncertainty about the current state as of May 16 and potential systematic issues with tracker updates, while maintaining that the baseline data and required completion rate make Yes substantially more likely than No.",
