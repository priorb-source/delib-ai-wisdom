  "information": "In Canada's 338-seat House of Commons, 170 seats are required for a majority government. The analysis was conducted with 8 days remaining before the election resolution date. At that time, advance voting was underway, with reports indicating a 36% increase in turnout compared to the 2021 election.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About six months (results expected on election night in October 2025, barring an earlier call within 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the Conservatives win a plurality or majority; the Liberals remain far below 172 seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "National CPC lead persists in double digits into the campaign; Ontario stays CPC-leaning or close, the Bloc remains strong in Quebec, NDP retains urban/progressive vote share, and Liberals finish in the ~60–110 seat range. Even a modest late campaign tightening leaves them well short of 172.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rare, late-breaking realignment: Liberal vote surges nationally to parity or better; Ontario swings decisively Liberal with strong GTA margins and widespread 905/416 pickups; Quebec sees a Liberal resurgence (30%+ share and 35–45 seats) with Bloc slippage; Atlantic Canada largely returns to the Liberals; Liberals outperform in urban/suburban BC and Manitoba. Strategic anti-CPC consolidation from NDP/Bloc voters boosts efficiency, lifting the Liberals to 172+ seats.",
    "rationale": "I place heavy weight on the status quo because large political environments usually change gradually. As of now (April 2025), public polling and seat models like 338Canada have for months shown the Conservatives with a substantial national lead and the Liberals far from majority territory. Leader approval and issue salience (cost of living, housing) have been unfavorable for the Liberals, and regional dynamics (CPC strength in Ontario suburbs, Bloc competitiveness in Quebec, NDP resilience in urban cores) make the Liberal path to 172 particularly steep. The research assistant note mentions higher advance turnout (reported as +36% vs 2021) with 8 days to go; that timing conflicts with today’s date, but if such a turnout spike materializes near the election, it does not automatically imply a Liberal recovery and can just as easily reflect a change election dynamic that historically disfavors incumbents. Why not higher: Getting to 172 requires a multi-region overperformance simultaneously—Ontario sweep-level margins, a major Quebec rebound, near-sweep in Atlantic Canada, and meaningful gains in BC—despite months of adverse polling and leader favorability. That combination is possible but improbable without a dramatic shock. Why not lower: There is still time for meaningful movement before October—major events (a damaging CPC scandal, economic improvement creating a feel-better factor, an unexpectedly strong budget reception), leadership dynamics, debate outperformance, or polling error could narrow the race. A highly efficient Liberal vote concentrated in seat-rich suburbs could also amplify modest national shifts. What would move me up: sustained polling narrowing to a national tie or small Liberal lead; Ontario polls showing Liberals +6 or more; Quebec Liberal vote share consistently above 30% with Bloc erosion; 338Canada/other seat models placing the Liberal median projection at 150+; marked improvement in leader net approvals and fundraising. What would move me down: CPC national lead entrenched at 15+ points; Ontario remaining CPC-leaning; Quebec stuck with Bloc dominance and Liberals below ~25%; seat models projecting Liberals under ~80 seats; fresh Liberal scandals or worsening economic sentiment.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Liberal Party win 172 or more seats in the 2025 Canadian federal election?\n\nQuestion background:\n[338Canada Federal Projection](https://338canada.com/federal.htm): \"The 338Canada project is a statistical model of electoral projections based on opinion polls, electoral history, and demographic data.

Fournier, physics and astrophysics professor at Cégep de Saint-Laurent in Montreal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Liberal Party of Canada wins greater than or equal to 172 seats in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Canada's 338-seat House of Commons, 170 seats are required for a majority government.

At that time, advance voting was underway, with reports indicating a 36% increase in turnout compared to the 2021 election.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
