    "review": "Both forecasters provide well-reasoned analyses that closely align with my initial thinking but emphasize critical factors I may have underweighted. Forecaster 2 and 3 both settled on 30% using similar logic to mine. Key insights they raised: (1) The recall is VERY recent - only 11 days old means minimal progress has been made on product recovery and verification. This is crucial. (2) They more strongly emphasize the inherent slowness of FSIS verification processes even with perfect company cooperation. (3) Both cite historical patterns showing 3-6+ months as typical closure times. Their convergence at 30% with similar reasoning is notable and suggests I may have been slightly overoptimistic at 38%. The main difference appears to be how much weight to place on the 'very recent' nature of the recall versus the moderate advantages (allergen type, defined scope, 68-day window being over 2 months).",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, I find their reasoning compelling and should adjust my forecast downward. The critical insight is that with only 11 days elapsed since issuance, there has been minimal time for product recovery, company verification, FSIS assessment, and bureaucratic closure processes. Even with perfect cooperation, FSIS verification is methodical and time-consuming. While I maintain that allergen recalls may receive some priority and the moderate size (65K pounds) could facilitate faster recovery, the historical baseline of 3-6+ months for typical recalls is a strong anchor. The 68-day window, while over 2 months, is on the shorter end of typical closure timelines. The status quo heavily favors recalls remaining Active. Both forecasters' convergence at 30% reflects appropriate weighting of these factors. I'm updating from 38% to 33% - acknowledging their valid points about limited elapsed time and slow regulatory processes while maintaining slightly higher probability based on the allergen priority factor and defined product scope.",
