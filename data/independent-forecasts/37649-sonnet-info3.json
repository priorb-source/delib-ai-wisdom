  "information": "Starlink's expansion faces both technical advantages and logistical challenges. The use of optical inter-satellite links reduces the need for local ground stations in every country. However, high demand has led to service pauses and waiting lists in other regions, including some African countries like Nigeria and Kenya. For Chad specifically, potential obstacles include its landlocked geography, limited retail infrastructure, and the need to finalize details such as import rules and spectrum fees.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks (47 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Chad is not currently listed as 'Available' on Starlink's availability map and would remain unlisted if no action is taken",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite securing the license in November 2024, Starlink encounters delays in finalizing operational requirements for Chad. Issues with import regulations, spectrum fee negotiations, payment system setup, or establishing local logistics partnerships prevent launch. With only 6.5 weeks remaining, these administrative and operational hurdles cannot be resolved in time, and Chad remains unlisted on the availability map through June 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink has been quietly preparing since receiving the license in November 2024. The technical infrastructure is ready via existing satellite coverage and inter-satellite links. Final negotiations with Chad authorities are completed in late May, and Starlink announces availability in mid-to-late June 2025, adding Chad to their availability map before the July 1 deadline, consistent with their market expansion strategy in Africa.",
    "rationale": "The core tension is between the 6+ month lead time since license approval and the fact that launch hasn't occurred yet. Favorable factors include: significant preparation time already elapsed, Starlink's technical readiness with existing satellite coverage, and their established African market presence. However, concerning factors dominate: if preparations were on track, launch would likely have occurred already in those 6 months. The research assistant notes specific obstacles - landlocked geography, limited infrastructure, and unfinalized details on import rules and spectrum fees. Other African countries have experienced service pauses and delays, suggesting regional challenges. Status quo bias is particularly relevant here: the world changes slowly, and with only 6.5 weeks remaining, there's limited time to overcome whatever obstacles prevented launch over the previous 6 months. My forecast isn't higher because the extended gap between license and launch suggests real complications, not just paperwork delays. It isn't lower because 6 months is substantial preparation time, Starlink has strong commercial incentives to expand, and 6.5 weeks could be sufficient for a prepared company to flip the switch. I would revise upward if evidence emerged of imminent launch preparations (equipment shipments, local announcements, staff hiring) or if Starlink added other recently-licensed African countries to their map. I would revise downward if reports surfaced of ongoing regulatory disputes or if we reached mid-June without any launch signals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Chad as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[SpaceX’s Starlink Secures License to Operate in Chad](https://spaceinafrica.com/2024/11/12/spacexs-starlink-secures-license-to-operate-in-chad/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Chad listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nStarlink's expansion faces both technical advantages and logistical challenges.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
