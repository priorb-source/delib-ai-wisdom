    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Zimbabwe does not make a second payment before June 1, 2025. The government's compensation process moves slowly due to bureaucratic procedures, budget constraints, and the need to coordinate with multiple stakeholders. The April 9 payment represents a significant milestone after years of delays, but the next disbursement requires additional time for administrative processing, fund allocation, and verification of eligible recipients. Zimbabwe's ongoing economic challenges and competing fiscal priorities mean that even with stated commitment, the practical timeline for a second payment extends beyond the question deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Zimbabwe makes another compensation payment within the next 38 days. Building on the momentum from the April 9 payment and the April 10 reaffirmation of commitment, the government accelerates disbursements to demonstrate good faith to international creditors and improve debt sustainability prospects. The relatively small size of the first payment ($3.1 million) suggests it was part of a planned series of smaller tranches. Political or economic incentives, such as upcoming international negotiations or pressure from development partners, motivate rapid follow-through on compensation commitments.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors NO. Zimbabwe just made its first compensation payment on April 9, 2025, merely 14 days ago. Government payment processes, particularly in countries facing economic constraints like Zimbabwe, typically operate on timescales of months, not weeks. The 38-day window until June 1 is extremely tight for bureaucratic systems to process, approve, and disburse a second payment. The research assistant found no evidence of an imminent second payment, which is telling. The April 10 reaffirmation shows commitment but doesn't indicate an accelerated timeline. However, the probability isn't negligible because: (1) they demonstrated capability to make payments very recently, (2) the small initial amount suggests possible sequential disbursements, and (3) the timing of the reaffirmation immediately after the first payment could signal momentum. For my forecast to increase, I would need evidence of: a planned second payment, specific timelines announced by officials, or fund allocation. For it to decrease further: explicit statements that payments will be quarterly or less frequent, or reports of budget constraints delaying further payments.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Zimbabwe, before June 1, 2025, make another payment to white farmers whose property was seized?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Zimbabwe reaffirms commitment to land compensation to spur growth, debt sustainability](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/04/10/zimbabwe-reaffirms-commitment-to-land-compensation-to-spur-growth-debt-sustainability)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) the government of Zimbabwe after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 makes an additional payment to former farmers covered under the 2020 Global Compensation Deed.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, Zimbabwe [was reported](https://nehandaradio.com/2025/04/09/zimbabwe-pays-us3-1m-to-former-white-farmers-as-part-of-land-compensation-deal/) to have made its first compensation payment, of USD $3.1 million. Additional such disbursements made after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 would count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
