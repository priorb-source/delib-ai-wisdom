    "review": "The other forecasters provide well-reasoned analyses that closely align with my initial assessment. Several strong points emerge from their reasoning: (1) The emphasis on central bank interventions as a stabilizing force - this is an important constraint I underweighted. Both the Fed and ECB typically act to prevent disorderly currency moves, especially at extreme levels. (2) The framing of 0.80 EUR/USD as equivalent to EUR/USD > 1.25 helpfully emphasizes how extreme this threshold is. (3) The historical context that such levels were last seen around 2008 reinforces the rarity of this scenario. (4) The strong consensus around 18% (both Forecasters 2 and 3) suggests this range is well-calibrated. However, I notice they may be slightly underweighting the tail risk from the current tariff turmoil. The article specifically mentions 'tariff turmoil' causing the 3-year low, and such policy-driven volatility can be more unpredictable than typical market dynamics. Trade wars can escalate in non-linear ways, and we only need the rate to touch 0.80 briefly at any point in the 7-week window. The clustering of forecasts at 18-20% appears reasonable, and the central bank intervention argument is compelling enough to warrant a modest downward revision from my initial 20%.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find their reasoning sound and their emphasis on central bank interventions as a limiting factor particularly convincing. The Fed and ECB have strong incentives to prevent extreme, disorderly currency moves, which would create a floor for how far the dollar could fall. This institutional constraint makes the tail scenario of reaching 0.80 less likely than I initially assessed. However, I maintain that the current tariff-driven volatility creates meaningful uncertainty. Unlike typical market fluctuations, policy-driven shocks can produce non-linear moves and may override normal market dynamics temporarily. The 7-week window, while short, is sufficient for a shock event to push rates through 0.80 even briefly. The strong consensus at 18% from both forecasters suggests this is a well-calibrated estimate. My initial 20% was slightly high given the central bank intervention constraint, but I don't think it warrants dropping all the way to 18% given the elevated policy uncertainty. Settling at 19% reflects: (1) acceptance of the central bank intervention argument, (2) acknowledgment of how rare such extreme moves are, (3) continued recognition that tariff-driven volatility creates above-normal tail risk, and (4) respect for the forecaster consensus while maintaining independent judgment.",
