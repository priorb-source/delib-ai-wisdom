    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (Metaculus will check on or after 2025-06-28; the visible figure will likely reflect the USDM map released Thu, 2025-06-26).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — fewer than 20.0 million Californians currently live in D1+ (Moderate Drought or worse), and weekly changes over one month are usually incremental.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "D1+ remains largely confined to interior valleys, foothills, and deserts while the Los Angeles–Orange–San Diego coastal strip and much of the Bay Area stay at D0 (abnormally dry) or better. “People in drought” holds below ~15 million through late June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A mid-June heat/dry spell plus worsening short-term indicators pushes D1 into the South Coast (LA/Orange/San Diego) and/or much of the Bay Area before the June 26 USDM release. That single expansion sweeps in dense populations and drives the total at or above 20 million.",
    "rationale": "- Definition and cadence: Drought.gov’s “people in drought” for California counts residents in USDM D1–D4. The number updates weekly with the USDM (typically Thursdays). The June 28 check will almost certainly reflect the June 26 map. Large swings in one month are uncommon unless drought expands into major metros.\n\n- Status quo and inertia: After very wet recent years, hydrologic baselines (reservoirs/soil moisture/snowmelt) have generally been adequate, which tempers USDM escalation. By late May, drought conditions have returned in parts of CA, but widespread D1 across the coastal metros is not yet the baseline. Given the USDM’s multi-indicator method and its conservatism, a statewide population-in-drought jump above 20 million within a single month would likely require D1 to encompass most of the LA Basin and/or Bay Area.\n\n- Population geometry: The 20 million threshold is mostly about whether D1 includes dense coastal metros. LA County (~10M) plus Orange (~3M) and San Diego (~3M) quickly approach 16–17M alone; add parts of the Inland Empire and you can exceed 20M. If those coastal counties remain at D0 or mixed categories, interior drought coverage won’t be enough to breach 20M.\n\n- Why not higher: The USDM tends to move gradually, especially when hydrologic indicators and reservoir storage remain decent heading into summer. One month is a short window for D1 to expand across both South Coast and Bay Area.\n\n- Why not lower: It’s late spring transitioning to California’s dry season; short-term indices can deteriorate quickly with a heat dome and lack of June precipitation. If even one large coastal metro cluster (e.g., LA/Orange) tips to D1 by the June 26 map, the count could approach or exceed 20M.\n\n- What would shift me upward: Clear USDM weekly expansion of D1 into the LA Basin and/or Bay Area in early/mid-June; reports of rapidly worsening short-term SPEI/soil moisture; a notable early-season heatwave with stressed vegetation and rising wildfire risk prompting category degradations.\n\n- What would shift me downward: Continued confinement of D1 to interior regions; confirmation that South Coast and Bay Area remain D0 or better through the mid-June USDM; resilient hydrologic indicators (reservoirs/snowmelt) holding off degradations.\n\nAssistant’s report: No additional information was provided beyond the general background; forecast is based on seasonality, USDM methodology, and population distribution considerations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
