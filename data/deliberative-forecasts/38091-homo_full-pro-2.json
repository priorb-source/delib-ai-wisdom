    "review": "My a nalysis aligns closely with the other forecasters on the key evidence: the historical signing rate of approximately 0.8-0.9 countries per month and the positive forward-looking statement from the NASA Administrator mentioning 'coming weeks'. The primary divergence lies in weighting these factors. I find Forecaster 3's reasoning particularly convincing, especially their point about the precedent for gaps in signings, such as the one in February-March 2025. This is a crucial piece of evidence I had not explicitly considered, and it highlights that the strong average rate does not guarantee a signing in any specific month. Forecaster 2's 55% feels slightly too anchored to the base rate without giving enough weight to the specific intelligence of the 'coming weeks' statement. Forecaster 3's 65% strikes a better balance, acknowledging the strong positive signals while tempering the forecast due to the historical irregularity and the lack of a publicly named candidate.",
    "rationale": "I am revising my forecast downward from 70% to 65%. The core positive evidence remains strong: a consistent signing rate over the past year and a half, recent diplomatic momentum, and a direct statement from NASA leadership anticipating new signatories in the 'coming weeks'. However, my initial forecast did not sufficiently account for the inherent variance in the timing of these diplomatic events. The key argument that persuaded me to lower my confidence was raised by Forecaster 3: the historical pattern of signings is not perfectly regular, as evidenced by the two-month gap with no new signatories in February and March 2025. This precedent demonstrates that short-term pauses can occur even amid strong overall momentum. A small administrative delay or shift in diplomatic calendars could easily push a signing from late June to early July, which would cause this question to resolve as 'No'. Therefore, a 65% forecast better reflects the balance between the strong positive indicators and the very real uncertainty introduced by the lack of a named candidate and the demonstrated irregularity of the signing schedule.",
