    "review": "- Forecaster 2 leans heavily on historical timing and interprets O’Rourke’s conditional language as pre-launch signaling. That’s plausible, but without corroborating tells (staff hires, filings, scheduled rollout), 60% feels high. The argument that 16 months out is “ideal” is true in general, but not determinative given ample time before the December filing deadline and a viable fall launch window.\n- Forecaster 3’s assessment closely matches mine: status quo strongly favors No with limited time remaining, offset by O’Rourke’s ability to launch quickly and prior early-announcement behavior. Their triggers for moving up/down are well-calibrated.\n- New arguments: F2’s “build suspense” framing isn’t a measurable signal; F3 adds emphasis on weighting the status quo with only ~40 days left, which I agree with. Neither introduces concrete new evidence (e.g., leaks, hires, filings) that would justify an upward move.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~40 days to July 1. Status quo is no announcement, no FEC activity, no visible staffing or exploratory committee, and continued focus on Powered by People.\n- Catalysts for a June announcement exist (Q2 fundraising deadline on June 30), and 16 months before the general fits O’Rourke’s past timelines. His network and name ID could enable a compressed launch.\n- Countervailing factors: No preparatory signals so far; he has incentive to wait for more clarity on GOP dynamics and the Democratic field; Texas’s likely December 2025 filing deadline provides ample runway; after two statewide losses, caution and timing discipline are plausible. Major statewide launches typically leak signs weeks ahead—absent to date.\n- Net: The probability of a June announcement is real but remains modest without concrete pre-launch indicators. I do not see sufficient new evidence from deliberation to shift my view.\n- I would move up on credible reporting of staff hires, FEC committee formation, scheduled statewide events, or clear language indicating a near-term decision. I would move down if he signals a fall timeline or if another top-tier Democrat enters first.\n- No change from my prior 30%.",
