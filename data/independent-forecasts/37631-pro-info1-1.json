  "information": "As of May 13, 2025, Tesla's market capitalization was approximately $1.078 trillion, while Walmart's was about $768.81 billion, giving Tesla a lead of roughly $309 billion. Tesla's P/E ratio stood at 163.88, with a GF Valuation labeling the company as \"Modestly Overvalued\" and HSBC reducing its price target to $130.00. In contrast, Walmart had a forward P/E ratio of 36.15 and received \"Buy\" ratings from all 19 analysts covering the stock.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, with the outcome determined after market close on June 27, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of May 13, 2025, Tesla's market capitalization of approximately $1.078 trillion is significantly higher than Walmart's market capitalization of about $768.81 billion.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tesla's stock price remains relatively stable, or any decline is not significant enough to erase the current ~$309 billion lead it holds over Walmart. Investor confidence in Tesla's long-term growth in AI, robotics, and new vehicle models prevents a major sell-off, and the gap remains.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Tesla's stock experiences a sharp decline of roughly 30% or more, while Walmart's valuation remains stable or increases. This downturn for Tesla could be triggered by negative news, such as missed production targets, disappointing guidance, a significant product recall, or a broader market correction that heavily impacts high-growth, high-P/E stocks.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the substantial ~$309 billion market capitalization lead that Tesla currently holds over Walmart. In a short timeframe of about six weeks, overcoming such a large gap is a low-probability event, making the status quo outcome, 'No', the most likely scenario. However, the probability for 'Yes' is not negligible due to the key difference between the two companies' stocks. Tesla is a highly volatile growth stock with a P/E ratio over 160, making it susceptible to large price swings on news or changes in market sentiment. The research indicating a 'Modestly Overvalued' assessment and a reduced price target from a major bank underscores this vulnerability. A price drop of ~30% would be required for Walmart to overtake Tesla (assuming Walmart's price is stable), which, while significant, is not unprecedented for Tesla's stock. My probability is not higher because a major market re-evaluation needs to happen in a very short window, and the base case is that the current valuation holds. My probability is not lower because Tesla's extreme valuation and volatility create a persistent and real risk of a sharp correction. I would increase my forecast for 'Yes' on news of a major negative catalyst for Tesla (e.g., confirmed production cuts, major regulatory action) or a broad market downturn. I would decrease it on strong positive news for Tesla, such as a breakthrough in FSD or better-than-expected delivery reports.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
