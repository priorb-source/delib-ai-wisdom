  "information": "As of May 18, 2025, Freddie Freeman of the Los Angeles Dodgers led the National League with a batting average of .375. Other top hitters in the NL included Will Smith (.336), Brendan Donovan (.330), and Manny Machado (.323). One report also listed Shohei Ohtani's average at .370. In contrast, three-time All-Star Marcus Semien was batting .174 for the Texas Rangers.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "42 days (6 weeks)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The highest batting average is currently .375. Batting averages tend to regress towards the mean as the season progresses and the sample size of at-bats increases, making it statistically less likely for a player to reach .400 from this point.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current league leaders, such as Freddie Freeman and Shohei Ohtani, continue to hit well but see their averages stabilize or slightly decline due to normal statistical regression and pitcher adjustments. No player goes on the extraordinary hot streak required to lift their average to .400 by the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An elite hitter, likely one of the current leaders already in the .370s, enters a period of exceptional performance through the month of June, batting well over .400 for the six-week stretch and pushing their season average over the .400 mark just before or on July 1st.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the historical rarity of a .400 batting average, the statistical principle of regression to the mean, and the current state of Major League Baseball. Hitting .400 is an iconic baseball milestone, last achieved for a full season in 1941 by Ted Williams. While this question only requires a player to be at .400 on July 1st—a significantly lower bar—it remains a very difficult feat.\n\nThe research provided indicates the current leader, Freddie Freeman, is at .375. To raise his average 25 points to .400 in the next six weeks would require him to hit at a blistering pace, likely over .430, during that period. This is not impossible for an elite hitter, but it is highly improbable against modern specialized pitching, defensive shifts, and bullpen strategies.\n\nThe strongest case against a 'Yes' outcome is statistical regression. As the season progresses and at-bats accumulate, extreme performances tend to move closer to a player's established average. It is far more common for a player hitting .375 in May to finish the season closer to .330-.340 than it is for them to ascend to .400.\n\nHowever, my forecast is not lower than 15% because there is recent precedent. In 2023, Luis Arráez was hitting above .400 as late as mid-June and was at .392 on July 1st. This demonstrates that it is plausible for a player in the modern era to carry a .400 average into the summer. With several elite hitters like Freeman and Ohtani currently posting very high averages, there are multiple candidates who could potentially go on such a run. My probability reflects a small chance that one of these players replicates Arráez's 2023 performance, or even surpasses it for this specific timeframe.\n\nI would increase my forecast if one of the league leaders' averages climbs into the .385-.390 range within the next 2-3 weeks. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if the top averages fall closer to the .350 mark, as this would make the required hot streak even more statistically improbable.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if on July 1, 2025, any Major League Baseball player in the 2025 regular season has a batting average of greater than or equal to .400 according to the [ESPN baseball stats page](https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of May 18, 2025, Freddie Freeman of the Los Angeles Dodgers led the National League with a batting average of .375.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
