    "review": "Both analyses reinforce my baseline. New or emphasized points I found useful: (1) the explicit gating of any summit on results of the June 2 talks, which compresses the already short timeline further; (2) Trump’s stated “two-week” observation window after late-May strikes, which likely pushes any decision into mid-June at the earliest; (3) the practical reminder that absence of planning leaks for a visit of this sensitivity is itself evidence against. I agree with the core logic that the combination of logistics, security, optics, and poor recent atmospherics makes a June Moscow trip highly unlikely. The counterpoint that Trump can move quickly (e.g., past DMZ visit) keeps probabilities above de minimis, but Russia is a much more complex adversarial environment than those precedents.",
    "rationale": "Path to Yes requires: a clear breakthrough from June 2 talks, Trump concluding by mid-June that Russia is acting in good faith, and both sides opting for Moscow rather than Washington or a neutral site, with rapid Secret Service and diplomatic arrangements under intense political scrutiny. The absence of any credible planning signals and the recent negative rhetoric make that stack of contingencies unlikely. I previously set 6%; the additional emphasis on the June 2 gating and Trump’s self-imposed observation window suggests even less calendar runway, so I trim slightly. I would move up on credible reports of a ceasefire framework plus concrete travel planning leaks or official guidance; I’d move down if June 2 talks stall or we pass mid-June with no signals.",
