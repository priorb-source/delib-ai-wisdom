  "information": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney formally invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the G7 summit scheduled for June 15-17, 2025, in Kananaskis, Alberta. The invitation was extended in March 2025. On May 27, 2025, Zelenskyy confirmed his intention to go, stating to Ukrainian journalists, \"G7: I was invited by the Canadian Prime Minister Carney. And I will be.\" Canadian security planning documents list Zelenskyy among the expected attendees, prompting preparations including a no-fly-zone over the area.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2024, Volodymyr Zelenskyy participated in three G7 summits: he attended the 2023 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, in person, and attended the 2022 summit in Elmau, Germany, and the 2024 summit in Apulia, Italy, virtually. Throughout the war, he has made numerous international trips, including visits to Washington, Paris, and Davos. On June 2, 2025, he arrived in Vilnius, Lithuania, to attend the Bucharest Nine summit ahead of the NATO summit scheduled for June 24-25 in The Hague.\n\nA key topic of discussion related to the G7 summit is the potential for new sanctions against Russia. US Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal have advocated for a new package of sanctions to be coordinated with European allies before the summit. However, according to news reports citing EU diplomats, it is unlikely that the European Union will have a new sanctions package ready by mid-June. President Zelenskyy has publicly called for increased pressure on Russia and for joint sanctions to be agreed upon at the G7 level.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12 days, as the summit begins on June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "President Zelenskyy will attend the G7 summit in person, consistent with his recent public statements and the preparations of the host nation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and significant military escalation in Ukraine, or a specific, high-level security threat, forces President Zelenskyy to cancel his international travel at the last minute to remain in his country.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "President Zelenskyy follows through on his public commitment, travels to Canada as planned, and participates in the G7 summit in person to lobby for continued and enhanced international support for Ukraine.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo, for which there is strong, recent evidence. The most critical piece of information is President Zelenskyy's unambiguous and public confirmation of his attendance on May 27, 2025, where he stated, 'I will be.' This signal of intent from the principal actor is paramount. This is corroborated by the host nation, Canada, whose security planning documents reportedly list him as an expected guest. Furthermore, President Zelenskyy has a history of traveling abroad for critical diplomatic engagements during the war, including an in-person G7 attendance in 2023, and he is currently on an international trip in Europe, demonstrating both his willingness and capacity to travel. The opportunity to directly engage with the leaders of the world's most powerful democracies is invaluable for Ukraine's war effort, making his attendance a high priority.\n\nThe probability is not higher than 90% primarily due to the ongoing war. The situation on the battlefield is inherently volatile. A major, unforeseen crisis, such as a large-scale Russian offensive or a domestic emergency, could compel him to remain in Ukraine. This represents the most significant risk factor. A specific security threat against his person during travel is a secondary but still material risk.\n\nThe probability is not lower because the available evidence overwhelmingly points towards his attendance. Cancelling a publicly confirmed trip to such a crucial summit would require a truly exceptional event. The diplomatic and strategic incentives to attend in person are extremely high, likely outweighing all but the most severe military or security crises. My forecast would decrease upon reports of a significant deterioration of the military situation in Ukraine. Conversely, it would increase slightly if he were reported to be en route to Canada.",
