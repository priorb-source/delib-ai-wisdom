    "review": "The other forecasters provided two crucial arguments I had underweighted. First, they both correctly identified that PSLF is established by statute, making Congressional action the most likely path to true termination, a much higher barrier than administrative changes. Second, they analyzed the likely behavior of the tracker's maintainers, arguing they would require a clear, unambiguous termination rather than a simple gutting of the program to mark the objective 'complete.' These points significantly strengthen the argument for a 'No' resolution. Their main justification for a non-zero probability (8%) rests on two possibilities: a rapid legislative action (e.g., via a reconciliation bill) or the tracker accepting a sweeping administrative rule as 'complete.' While I find their reasoning for a low probability sound, their 8% forecast seems to underweight the extreme difficulty of passing any legislation in under seven weeks and the procedural impossibility of finalizing a new rule in that timeframe.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 1% was based on the slow pace of government and specific evidence that the Department of Education was actively working to refine, not terminate, the program. The other forecasters' analyses have convinced me to adjust my reasoning and probability. Their emphasis on the statutory barrier to termination and the high standard of evidence likely required by the tracker's moderators reinforces my conviction that a 'No' outcome is overwhelmingly likely. However, their identification of a fast-tracked legislative vehicle, such as a reconciliation bill, as a specific, plausible (though low-probability) path to a 'Yes' outcome leads me to believe my initial 1% forecast was too low. It didn't sufficiently account for this specific mechanism, treating the possibility more as an unspecific 'black swan' event. While I believe the 8% forecast of my peers is too high given the severe time constraints and the contradictory evidence of ongoing rulemaking efforts, I am updating my forecast upwards to acknowledge this specific legislative risk. I am increasing my forecast from 1% to 3% to better reflect the small but non-negligible chance that Congress could include this termination in a must-pass bill before the deadline.",
