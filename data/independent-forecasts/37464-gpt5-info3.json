  "information": "The recall was issued on February 24, 2025. According to the FSIS recall webpage, the status of the recall remained 'Active' as of May 8, 2025. The general FSIS process for closing a recall requires verification that all affected product has been accounted for and removed from commerce, and confirmation that the company has implemented appropriate corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 23 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — it remains listed as Active on the FSIS page when checked on/after June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS verification and documentation take longer than expected (e.g., effectiveness checks, corrective actions, and website update lag), so the recall page still shows Active on June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "LPK1 completes all corrective actions and FSIS verifies product removal and prevention steps; FSIS updates the recall status to Closed before June 1.",
    "rationale": "- Current state: The recall (issued Feb 24, 2025) is still Active as of May 8, 2025 per the assistant’s report. With about three weeks left, the status quo points to No unless an update occurs. Good forecasting practice puts weight on the current state, which usually persists over short horizons.\n- Typical timelines: FSIS recalls for misbranding/undeclared allergens commonly close within a few months once effectiveness checks and corrective actions are verified. Being ~10 weeks in suggests closure could happen soon, but not guaranteed; many recalls take 3–6 months to close. The remaining 23 days is a relatively short window.\n- Scope specifics: This recall appears limited (vending machines in Washington) and involves an undeclared fish allergen (likely anchovies in Caesar dressing). Limited distribution and perishable RTE wraps increase the plausibility of swift product removal, which supports some chance of closure within the window.\n- Countervailing considerations: Small firms can take longer to document corrective actions; FSIS closure postings can lag. The fact it’s still Active at ~10 weeks indicates this case may be slower-than-average, reducing the near-term closure odds.\n- Why not higher: Status is currently Active; only ~3 weeks remain; many FSIS recalls close on multi-month timelines. Update cadence/verification can push closures past arbitrary calendar cutoffs.\n- Why not lower: Narrow distribution, perishable product, and a non-pathogen misbranding issue raise the chance that all checks are completed soon after ~10 weeks.\n- What would move me up: Evidence of completed corrective actions, an FSIS effectiveness audit completion note, similar recent FSIS recalls closing near the 10–12 week mark, or any company/FSIS communication suggesting imminent closure.\n- What would move me down: Recall expansion, new findings (e.g., additional affected lots or locations), reported adverse reactions, or signs of corrective-action delays/FSIS enforcement that typically prolong closure.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe recall was issued on February 24, 2025. According to the FSIS recall webpage, the status of the recall remained 'Active' as of May 8, 2025. The general FSIS process for closing a recall requires verification that all affected product has been accounted for and removed from commerce, and confirmation that the company has implemented appropriate corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
