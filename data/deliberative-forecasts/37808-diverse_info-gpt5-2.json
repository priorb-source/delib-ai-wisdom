    "review": "Both forecasters appropriately emphasize short-term inertia and the statutory nature of DV. Forecaster 2 adds a useful operational detail I hadn’t explicitly weighed: the DV-2026 status check running through Sept 2026, which signals ongoing program infrastructure that makes near-term removal of the entry instructions page less likely. Forecaster 2 also highlights the exact-URL resolution risk (migration/redirect/IT mishap); I agree that technical risk is the dominant tail risk in this short window, though 98% feels a bit high given that exact-path requirements occasionally bite. Forecaster 3’s reasoning on executive/legislative timing constraints is sound and acknowledges some residual risk from sudden executive action or site restructuring; their 89% may be a touch conservative given how little time remains and the lack of any DV-specific signals. Overall, the new points nudge me slightly higher, chiefly due to the DV-2026 status check continuity signal and the absence of concrete movement on DV repeal/suspension.",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution (~6 weeks) and institutional inertia strongly favor the page remaining accessible at the specified URL. Ending or suspending DV via legislation before July 1 is highly unlikely given Senate dynamics and process timelines; unilateral executive removal of statutory program instructions is also unlikely on this timeline and would probably be preceded by public signaling. The most plausible failure mode is technical/administrative: a CMS change, URL restructuring, or a publishing error that breaks this exact path. While possible, there’s no indication of an imminent travel.state.gov overhaul, and historically State preserves key program URLs or implements redirects. Balancing minimal policy risk against modest technical risk, I’m nudging my estimate up from 82% to 93%.",
