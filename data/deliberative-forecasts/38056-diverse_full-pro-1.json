    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in complete agreement on both the final forecast and the underlying rationale. The deliberation process was less about contrasting viewpoints and more about reinforcing a shared, evidence-based conclusion. Forecaster 2 provided a helpful framework by explicitly listing the five highly improbable, sequential events required for a 'Yes' outcome, which clearly illustrates the near-impossibility of the scenario. Forecaster 3 added another critical layer of analysis that I had not fully articulated: the conditional probability. They correctly pointed out that even in the vanishingly small chance that the fight is re-booked, Johnny Walker would still have to win against an undefeated opponent, a challenge in which he would likely be the underdog. This additional consideration further solidifies the justification for an extremely low forecast. Both analyses were convincing and strengthened the confidence in my initial assessment.",
    "rationale": "My forecast remains unchanged. The consensus among all forecasters is based on a clear and undisputed set of facts: Johnny Walker has officially withdrawn from the UFC 316 bout due to injury, and the UFC has officially replaced him with Brendson Ribeiro. With the event only about twelve days away, this status quo is firmly entrenched. The analyses from my peers reinforced my initial conclusion by adding further depth. As Forecaster 2 detailed, a 'Yes' outcome would require an extraordinary and unlikely chain of events: Ribeiro's withdrawal, Walker's instantaneous recovery and medical clearance, the UFC's decision to re-book the original fight on short notice, and finally, Walker actually winning. Furthermore, as Forecaster 3 highlighted, even if this improbable sequence were to occur, the probability of a 'Yes' resolution would be further diminished by Walker's chances in the fight itself. Given his two-fight losing streak against Murzakanov's undefeated 14-0 record, Walker would be the underdog, making the conditional probability of his victory significantly less than 50%. The product of these two very low probabilities (P(fight happens) * P(Walker wins)) results in a final probability that is vanishingly small. Therefore, I am maintaining my 1% forecast, which accounts for the remote possibility of a bizarre, last-minute turn of events while acknowledging the overwhelming evidence pointing to a 'No' resolution.",
