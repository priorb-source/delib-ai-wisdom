    "review": "Forecaster 2’s reasoning largely mirrors mine: short runway, multiple sequential hurdles (spillover → detection → sequencing → official attribution → credible reporting), and a low base rate. Their 2% aligns with my initial estimate and is well-justified.\n\nForecaster 3 argues 9%, emphasizing selection effects (the question’s existence implying concern) and that six weeks is enough time if a spillover occurs. I don’t find the selection-effect argument persuasive; forecasting platforms routinely host low-probability biosafety questions. Also, the key gating factor is not just spillover but timely, specific attribution to “HKU5-CoV-2” by a credible source. Even if a merbecovirus case were detected, it may be labeled generically (e.g., “MERS-related coronavirus”) rather than this specific designation, reducing near-term resolution likelihood. Without concrete signals (suspected clusters, receptor-binding data, lab exposure reports, or agency notes), 9% seems too high for a 6-week window.\n\nNew arguments I hadn’t emphasized: both forecasters highlight the intensified post-COVID surveillance as a modest upward pressure. I already accounted for this qualitatively, but it reinforces not going below ~1–2%.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~6 weeks. The base rate of immediate human detection/attribution after discovery of an animal merbecovirus is very low. Multiple steps must align quickly, and the resolution likely requires explicit identification as “HKU5-CoV-2” by a credible source, which adds a naming/attribution hurdle beyond detecting “a novel merbecovirus.” There are no current signals (clusters, preprints, WHO/CDC notes) pointing toward imminent human cases.\n\nBalancing factors: slightly higher detection capacity post-2020 and the possibility of a rapidly posted preprint or national CDC report do keep the probability above de minimis. However, absent any concrete leads and given the short timeframe and naming constraint, my prior remains low.\n\nNet: Forecaster 2 supports my prior. Forecaster 3’s higher estimate rests on weak selection-effect reasoning without new evidence. I make a negligible upward adjustment to reflect that credible sources need not be limited to WHO/CDC (preprints or national agencies could suffice), but this was already mostly in my prior.\n",
