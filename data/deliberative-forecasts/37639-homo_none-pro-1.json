    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the core driver of this forecast: the U.S. legal and immigration systems are exceptionally slow, and the deadline of July 1, 2025, is less than two months away. We all agree this makes a 'No' outcome highly likely. The only difference is in quantifying this low probability, with Forecaster 2 at 10% and Forecaster 3 and myself at 5%. Forecaster 2's reasoning that the system is *capable* of moving quickly, even if it rarely does, is a valid point about tail risk. However, I find the reasoning from Forecaster 3, which aligns with my own, to be more convincing. Without any specific information suggesting this case is being prioritized or is at its absolute final stage, anchoring our probability to the system's typical, slow behavior is the more robust approach.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am maintaining my forecast. The deliberation process has reinforced my initial reasoning. All three forecasters correctly identified that the primary obstacle to a 'Yes' resolution is the significant inertia of both the judicial and administrative systems involved in a contested deportation. For Mahmoud Khalil to be deported before July 1, 2025, a series of low-probability events must occur in rapid succession: a swift and final court decision against him, the denial of any stay of removal, and unusually fast administrative processing by ICE. While Forecaster 2 makes a fair point that the system is capable of unusual speed, this remains a rare exception. Given the complete lack of information to suggest this case is exceptional, a 5% probability (or a 1-in-20 chance) more accurately reflects the compound improbability of this entire sequence occurring within the short 47-day timeframe than a 10% probability.",
