    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 53 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "GoPro continues normal operations without filing for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GoPro maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations, manages its debt covenant requirements, continues operations through restructuring or operational improvements, and reaches July 1, 2025 without filing any bankruptcy petition",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GoPro faces an acute liquidity crisis in the next 53 days, defaults on debt obligations, exhausts financing options, and management or creditors file for Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection before July 1, 2025",
    "rationale": "With only 53 days remaining until the resolution date, this is an extremely short time window for a bankruptcy filing. The base rate for public companies filing bankruptcy in such a compressed timeframe is very low. GoPro recently announced Q4 and 2024 results, which indicates ongoing corporate operations and SEC compliance. If the company were facing imminent bankruptcy, there would typically be clear warning signs such as going concern qualifications from auditors, missed debt payments, covenant violations, or explicit liquidity warnings in their earnings announcement. The research assistant provided no information suggesting such distress signals exist. However, I cannot assign this near zero probability because: (1) GoPro has historically faced financial challenges in the competitive action camera market, (2) without access to the detailed Q4 earnings content, I cannot rule out deteriorating conditions, and (3) some bankruptcies can occur with limited public warning if triggered by sudden events like a major creditor demanding payment or loss of a critical financing facility. The probability is not higher because voluntary Chapter 11 filings typically require planning and preparation time, and involuntary bankruptcies are rare and require creditor action. The probability is not lower because I lack complete information about GoPro's current cash position and covenant compliance. I would update higher if I saw evidence of debt defaults, going concern warnings, or stock price collapse, and lower if detailed financials showed strong liquidity and no near-term debt maturities.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill GoPro file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and 2024 Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000150043525000003/gpro2024-12x31exh991xer.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
