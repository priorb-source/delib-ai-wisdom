    "review": "Forecaster 2 rightly emphasizes that late‑stage IPOs can list within a few weeks once near-ready and that the Forbes piece signals momentum, but their argument leans too heavily on a single headline without corroborating milestones (updated S-1 with price range, declared effectiveness, roadshow launch). They also underplay last‑mile slippage risk. Forecaster 3’s milestone- and timeline-based caution is compelling: with ~6 weeks left, any minor SEC or market hiccup could push past July 1, and crypto/regulatory sensitivity increases tail risks. However, 35% seems too low if Circle has already advanced its filing process; the April coverage likely reflects more than early-stage intent, and June executions are feasible in a cooperative window. Overall, F3’s caution moves me down from my prior, but not as far as 35%.",
    "rationale": "I still think Circle has meaningful momentum and could execute a June listing if its filing is advanced, but the absence (in the information we have) of concrete late-stage markers—price range, roadshow, SEC effectiveness—makes the next 6–7 weeks tight. Crypto/regulatory and general market risks further increase the chance of a slip beyond July 1. Venue risk (NYSE vs. Nasdaq) appears limited if prior indications favor NYSE, but until explicitly confirmed it’s not zero. Balancing these, I’m reducing my estimate from 65% to 55% to reflect timeline compression and last‑mile execution risk while still acknowledging a realistic path to a late‑June NYSE debut.",
