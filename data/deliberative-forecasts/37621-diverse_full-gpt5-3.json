    "review": "Forecaster 2 makes a strong case about leadership pressure and the reframing to a general aiding-the-runner ban. The added point I hadn’t weighed as explicitly is the signaling value of the quick revisit—though I’m not convinced that alone implies votes are in hand, as swift tabling-to-revisit is common when trying to build consensus. I think 2 underweights two risks: (1) enforcement complexity of a field-wide push/pull ban touching many routine plays and (2) the lack of injury data removing the league’s best public-facing justification. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on the 8-vote gap and status quo inertia is persuasive and aligns with my prior. One quibble: calling this a mid-course change isn’t quite right—it’s still the normal offseason window—but the broader point about owner reluctance to legislate out successful strategies stands. Overall, 3’s reasoning better matches the institutional dynamics; 2’s is directionally right on influence but, in my view, too optimistic on conversion odds in a short window.",
    "rationale": "Key facts remain: only one realistic decision window (May 20–21); the last count was 16 yes votes, needing 8 more; Commissioner/league office support raises odds but doesn’t guarantee a 24-vote supermajority; health/safety has no injury data; and the broadened rule likely expands enforcement burdens beyond the short-yardage sneak, which could alienate fence-sitters. I give some credit to the strategic reframing and leadership push—those can move votes—but eight flips in ~6 weeks is a big lift, and the lack of an obvious safety rationale plus potential unintended consequences make a clean consensus harder. Net: I keep a meaningful but sub-40% chance of passage at the May meeting. I edge slightly down from my prior given the enforcement/scope concerns highlighted in deliberation and the absence of fresh reporting indicating real vote movement.",
