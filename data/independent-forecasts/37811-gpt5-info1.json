  "information": "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it will decommission its 'Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters' database. The database, created in 1980 to track the financial costs of major climate events, will not be updated beyond 2024 and its existing information will be archived. According to AM Best, a credit rating agency, the removal of this centralized data source could hinder insurance companies' ability to model, price, and manage risks associated with climate-related disasters. NOAA communications chief Kim Doster stated the change is 'in alignment with evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes'.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Climate.gov remains online and reachable, as it is now.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Climate.gov domain becomes unreachable to IsItDownRightNow due to decommissioning, DNS/TLS misconfiguration, a sustained outage or DDoS at the time of the check, or a firewall/WAF change that blocks the monitor’s requests.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Climate.gov continues normal operations (or is archived/redirects but remains reachable over HTTP/HTTPS) and IsItDownRightNow reports it as UP when Metaculus checks on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: Government web portals like Climate.gov have high uptime and strong institutional inertia. As of May 7, 2025, the resolution source reports Climate.gov is UP. With ~6 weeks remaining, the status quo strongly favors a Yes.\n- Political/organizational risk: The research assistant notes NOAA announced decommissioning the Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters database (no new updates beyond 2024; archived). That indicates willingness to curtail or restructure climate-related public information and slightly raises risk to related sites. However, historically (2017–2020) most changes involved altering or archiving content rather than taking entire domains offline. Climate.gov is a flagship communication portal; shutting it down outright would be highly visible and controversial.\n- Technical risk: Even stable sites can have transient outages, TLS certificate lapses, or WAF/CDN misconfigurations. Because resolution hinges on IsItDownRightNow at the moment Metaculus checks, a brief outage or a block of the monitor’s IP could cause a No. That tail risk likely accounts for a few percentage points.\n- Why not higher: Non-zero chance of politically driven web changes, plus transient operational issues or monitor-specific blocking on/around the check time.\n- Why not lower: Strong base rates for continuity, current uptime, and the likelihood that any near-term changes would be archival or content-focused rather than domain removal. A redirect/archival page would still likely count as UP.\n- What would move me up: Explicit NOAA confirmation that Climate.gov will remain online; evidence of recent reliability (e.g., 100% uptime over June), or reports that any climate web changes will be content-only. What would move me down: Credible reporting of a planned shutdown or consolidation of Climate.gov, extended outages observed in late June, DNS/TLS issues, or signs that the site is blocking third-party monitors like IsItDownRightNow.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA's Climate.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNational Security Archive: [Disappearing Data: Trump Administration Removing Climate Information from Government Websites](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/climate-change-transparency-project-foia/2025-02-06/disappearing-data-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Climate.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced it will decommission its 'Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters' database.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
