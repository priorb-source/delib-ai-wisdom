  "information": "The Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which aims to ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program. The bill, authored by Senator Charles Perry and supported by Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, passed the Senate on May 7, 2025, with a 25-6 vote and was sent to the House State Affairs Committee. Proponents cite concerns over public health and safety regarding unregulated high-THC products. Lt. Gov. Patrick has stated he will push for a special legislative session if a ban is not passed during the regular session. The proposed law would make possession of consumable hemp products punishable by up to one year in jail and a $4,000 fine.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - currently THC is not banned in Texas, so if nothing changes, the question resolves as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The House fails to pass SB 3, either because it dies in committee, fails on the floor, or the Governor doesn't sign it before July 1, 2025. The Texas regular legislative session ends (typically late May/early June) without passage, and either no special session is called or a special session fails to pass the ban in time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The House State Affairs Committee advances SB 3, the full House passes it, and the Governor signs it into law before July 1, 2025. This could happen during the regular session or in a special session called by the Governor at Lt. Gov. Patrick's urging.",
    "rationale": "The Senate passage with a strong 25-6 vote margin demonstrates significant support for the ban among Texas senators. Lt. Gov. Patrick's strong backing and willingness to push for a special session shows high-level political commitment. Texas has historically maintained conservative drug policies, which favors passage.\n\nHowever, several factors create uncertainty: (1) The bill must still clear the House State Affairs Committee and pass the full House, where it may face different political dynamics and stronger hemp industry lobbying. (2) Time is constrained - Texas regular legislative sessions last 140 days in odd-numbered years, meaning the current session likely ends in late May or early June, leaving limited time for House consideration. (3) The hemp/CBD industry represents significant economic interests and will mobilize opposition. (4) Even after potential House passage, the Governor must sign it.\n\nThe special session option is notable - it provides a backup mechanism if the regular session runs out of time, but special sessions require the Governor to call them and can only address topics the Governor specifies. This adds complexity.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because House passage is far from guaranteed despite Senate support, industry opposition will be fierce, and time constraints are real. It's not lower because the strong Senate vote, high-level political backing, and special session option create multiple pathways to passage. For me to update higher, I'd need to see the bill advance quickly through the House committee or strong signals of House leadership support. To update lower, I'd need to see the bill stall in committee or strong House opposition emerge.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which aims to ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
