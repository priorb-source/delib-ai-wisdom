    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters. We independently arrived at the same 1% forecast, driven by the same core reasoning: the ongoing civil war in Sudan and the resulting collapse of state institutions make ratification practically impossible within the given timeframe. Both other forecasters correctly identified the absence of a functioning legislature and the extremely short deadline as insurmountable barriers. Their analyses reinforced my own conclusions, particularly by emphasizing Sudan's suspension from the African Union as an additional diplomatic hurdle, a point I had noted but perhaps not weighted as heavily. Forecaster 3 also provided a helpful articulation of a specific, albeit purely theoretical, 'black swan' scenario (an externally-brokered peace deal with ratification as a condition), which aligns with the reasoning for not forecasting an absolute 0%. The discussion has not introduced any new evidence or arguments that would challenge the initial assessment; instead, it has solidified my confidence in the original forecast.",
    "rationale": "My reasoning remains unchanged, and my confidence in the initial forecast has been reinforced by the deliberation. The fundamental barrier to Sudan ratifying the AfCFTA before July 1, 2025, is the ongoing civil war. This conflict has resulted in the complete absence of the necessary state apparatus for such an action: there is no stable, unified government, and critically, no functioning legislature to legally process and approve an international treaty. The timeline, with less than one month remaining, renders any scenario leading to ratification incredible. Such a scenario would require an immediate cessation of hostilities, the formation of a legitimate and unified government, and the rapid execution of the entire ratification process. There is no evidence to suggest any of these prerequisite steps are underway or even possible. The consensus with the other forecasters confirms that this is the only logical conclusion based on the available facts. Therefore, I will not be updating my forecast.",
