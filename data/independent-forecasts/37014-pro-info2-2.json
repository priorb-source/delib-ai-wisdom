  "information": "National polling data indicates that support for Reform UK is between 24% and 27%. Some local polls have suggested a surge in support for the party in Kent, and a number of local councillors have defected to join Reform UK.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The election is scheduled for May 1, 2025, with results expected in the following days. The outcome should be known in approximately two weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservative Party wins the most seats, maintaining its historical position as the largest party on Kent County Council, even if it loses its overall majority.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party retains the most seats. This could happen if their core local support holds up better than polls suggest, benefiting from incumbency and a well-organized local campaign. Alternatively, the anti-Conservative vote could split between Reform UK, Labour, and the Liberal Democrats, allowing Tory candidates to win many divisions with a plurality but not a majority of votes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The national surge in support for Reform UK translates effectively at the local level. Disaffected Conservative voters switch to Reform in large numbers, leading to a collapse in the Tory vote share. Reform's focused campaign on local and national issues resonates with Kent voters, allowing them to win a plurality of seats across the county, as predicted by the Electoral Calculus poll.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant conflict between historical precedent and recent polling data. The status quo is strong; the Conservative Party has controlled Kent County Council for decades, and such incumbency is a powerful advantage in local elections. Normally, this would be the anchor for the forecast. However, the current political environment is highly volatile. The research material points to two critical factors pushing against the status quo: sustained high national polling for Reform UK (24-27%) and, more importantly, a specific seat-level poll from Electoral Calculus predicting a Reform UK victory in Kent. This MRP (Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification) poll is a much stronger piece of evidence than national polls alone, as it models local outcomes. The defection of local councillors adds anecdotal weight to this trend, suggesting a genuine shift in the political landscape. The question asks only if Reform will win the 'most seats' (a plurality), not an overall majority, which lowers the bar for a 'Yes' outcome. My probability is not higher because single polls can have significant margins of error, and the First-Past-The-Post electoral system is notoriously difficult for challenger parties to overcome unless their vote is efficiently distributed. The Conservatives' local campaign infrastructure should not be underestimated. My probability is not lower because ignoring the specific, recent, and methodologically advanced Electoral Calculus poll, which directly addresses the question at hand, would be a forecasting error. The national collapse in Conservative support is a real phenomenon that creates the conditions for such a dramatic shift. I would increase my probability if another poll corroborated the Electoral Calculus findings. I would decrease it if late polling showed the Conservative vote firming up or the Labour/Lib Dem vote rising at Reform's expense.",
