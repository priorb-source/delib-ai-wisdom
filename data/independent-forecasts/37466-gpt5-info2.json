  "information": "The adoption of the name 'Gulf of America' has varied among non-governmental entities. Google updated its Maps service to display 'Gulf of America' for users in the United States, while in other regions, both names are sometimes used. As of late January 2025, other major map publishers like National Geographic and Apple had not made the change. The renaming has generated international controversy, with Mexican officials, including President Claudia Sheinbaum, protesting the unilateral change.

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas keeps the North America page labeling as “Gulf of Mexico” through July 1, 2025, without adding or substituting “Gulf of America.”",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas updates the North America page to show “Gulf of America” (either as the sole label or alongside “Gulf of Mexico”), or implements US-only geotargeting that displays “Gulf of America” to US visitors.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and context: The research assistant notes Google Maps shows “Gulf of America” for US users, but other major publishers (Apple, National Geographic) have not followed as of late January 2025. There is international pushback, and the International Hydrographic Organization has not recognized the change. This points to a lack of consensus and suggests many reference publishers will retain “Gulf of Mexico” for now.\n- Site-specific considerations: The resolution hinges on WorldAtlas’s North America page (not just an article). While the linked WorldAtlas article title acknowledging “Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)” suggests editorial openness to mentioning the alternative name, the map/label on the North America overview page is likely a more static asset that is updated less frequently and follows conventional naming. WorldAtlas is unlikely to implement geolocation-specific naming on a legacy page; adding a dual label would require an intentional update under controversy without an external standards body endorsement.\n- Status quo weight: With roughly 7–8 weeks left, inertia and lack of institutional standardization favor no change by July 1. Major reference sources not adopting, plus IHO non-recognition and political sensitivity, all reduce near-term likelihood of WorldAtlas making a visible label change on a flagship map page.\n- Why not higher: No official standard change; limited time; key publishers have not moved; potential reputational risk for unilateral renaming; technical friction to modifying a static map page.\n- Why not lower: WorldAtlas has already acknowledged the alternate name in an article, which modestly raises the chance they might add a dual label on the map. Google’s US change could exert pressure or provide cover for dual naming. The criterion resolves Yes even if both names appear.\n- What would move me up: Evidence that WorldAtlas updates other site maps to include “Gulf of America,” a public editorial note adopting dual naming, additional major US reference publishers adopting the term, or any sign of US government or standards bodies endorsing the alternative.\n- What would move me down: Google reverting to “Gulf of Mexico,” explicit statements from WorldAtlas adhering to conventional naming only, IHO or major style guides reaffirming “Gulf of Mexico” as the sole name, or no movement by peer publishers by mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe adoption of the name 'Gulf of America' has varied among non-governmental entities. Google updated its Maps service to display 'Gulf of America' for users in the United States, while in other regions, both names are sometimes used.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
