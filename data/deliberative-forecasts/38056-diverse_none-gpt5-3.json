    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds concrete matchup points (huge height/reach edge for Walker and potential ring rust for Murzakanov). Those are relevant and could nudge Walker’s conditional win chance upward a bit. However, their 48% overall seems to largely ignore the dominant uncertainty: whether this fight is even on UFC 316. Forecaster 3 leans heavily on a UFC Stats link as evidence the fight is likely scheduled and assumes a 50–60% chance it’s on UFC 316; that’s not persuasive without corroboration. UFC Stats “fight-details” links aren’t reliable priors for future scheduling, and the research assistant had no confirming info. Thus, F3 likely overestimates the booking probability. Net: F2 improves the conditional-on-fight-happening analysis slightly; F3’s scheduling probability looks too high.",
    "rationale": "I keep the decomposition: P(Yes) = P(fight is on UFC 316) × P(it proceeds) × P(Walker wins | it happens). With no confirmation this specific matchup is booked for UFC 316, P(fight on 316) remains low. Given we’re roughly three months out, I’ll set P(on 316) ≈ 12% (plausible pairing but many alternatives and cards). If booked, typical proceed rate ≈ 85–90% → use 88%. Conditional win chance: I had Walker ~40–45% versus Murzakanov. Forecaster 2’s points (size edge, possible inactivity for Azamat) justify leaning toward the high end, say ~43%, but not to favorite status given Walker’s volatility and chin versus Azamat’s power/durability. Multiply: 0.12 × 0.88 × 0.43 ≈ 4.5%. I’ll round slightly up to reflect the plausibility and time proximity: 6%. I would materially update upward only on an official announcement for UFC 316 (then roughly 0.88 × 0.43 ≈ 38%), and down if either is booked elsewhere or there’s credible injury/withdrawal news, or market odds strongly favor Murzakanov if booked.",
