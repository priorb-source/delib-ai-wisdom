  "information": "The push for expanded voter citizenship verification in Florida aligns with a broader national trend. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration nationwide, though it is unlikely to pass the Senate. Separately, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose stricter verification requirements. Other states have also advanced similar legislation; Wyoming passed a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote that is set to become effective on July 1, and a bill in Tennessee to create a citizenship verification portal for election workers has advanced in its state house.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 2025 regular session adjourned without passing any bill that requires voters to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship (e.g., HB 831 stalls or is omitted from the final elections package), and no special session is called on elections before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An elections bill that requires at least some voters (e.g., first-time registrants or those lacking database matches) to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship passes both chambers late in session and is transmitted to the governor and signed (or becomes law without signature) before July 1. Alternatively, leadership calls a special session in June to pass such a requirement and it is enacted promptly.",
    "rationale": "- Legislative timing: Florida’s regular session typically runs 60 days (Mar 4–May 2 in 2025). As of May 6, the regular session has effectively ended. If a proof-of-citizenship requirement did not clear both chambers by Sine Die, the remaining path before July 1 is a special session—which is possible but uncommon absent a pressing trigger. This timing bottleneck weighs toward No.\n- Partisan and policy context: Republicans hold large majorities in both chambers and Gov. DeSantis has repeatedly signed election-related tightening (2021–2023). That institutional alignment raises baseline odds if such a bill reached the floor. However, documentary proof of citizenship is a sharper legal edge than prior Florida changes due to potential conflict with the NVRA and prior federal precedents (e.g., constraints on requiring proof for federal-form registrants). That legal risk can deter swift passage or push lawmakers to prefer back-end database checks over voter-provided documents—changes that may not satisfy the question’s “voters provide proof” criterion.\n- Bill content threshold: The resolution requires that voters be required to provide documentary proof (any subset counts). Narrow provisions—e.g., requiring proof only when database checks fail for first-time registrants—would qualify. Purely administrative cross-check expansions that don’t require voters to submit documents would not. This distinction reduces the chance that a more modest elections package incidentally resolves the question as Yes.\n- Governor’s action window: If such a bill passed by Sine Die, enactment before July 1 would still depend on transmission timing and the 15-day signature window. DeSantis would likely sign quickly, but delayed transmittal could push enactment past July 1. Conditional on passage, enactment before July 1 is still highly likely, but not certain.\n- External signals (RA summary): The U.S. House passed the SAVE Act and the President issued an EO emphasizing citizenship verification, and states like Wyoming and Tennessee moved related measures. This national momentum marginally increases the appetite and political cover for Florida action, but it does not overcome Florida’s session timing and NVRA risk constraints.\nWhy not higher: Session timing has likely closed the regular path; special sessions are uncertain; and lawmakers may favor verification mechanisms that don’t require voter-provided documents (wouldn’t count).\nWhy not lower: Florida’s track record of annual election-law packages, unified GOP control, gubernatorial support, and the fact that even a targeted proof requirement for a subset of voters would qualify all keep a live path to Yes (including if a bill already passed in the final days and is awaiting gubernatorial action).\nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting that HB 831 or equivalent passed both chambers; a governor’s bill signing notice; or a special session call with proof-of-citizenship on the agenda. What would move me down: Confirmation that the elections package passed without any voter documentary-proof requirement, or leadership statements ruling out a special session on elections before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe push for expanded voter citizenship verification in Florida aligns with a broader national trend.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
