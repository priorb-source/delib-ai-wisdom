  "information": "The 13-year gas transmission agreement between Bulgaria’s state-owned gas company Bulgargaz and Turkey’s BOTAŞ was signed in January 2023. The contract includes a 'take or pay' clause, obligating Bulgargaz to pay approximately $580,000 per day regardless of whether it uses the reserved capacity. Since July 2024, Bulgargaz has ceased payments, accumulating a debt reported to be around 4 billion leva (approximately €2 billion). Bulgarian officials have stated the company does not have the financial capacity to pay this debt, and Bulgargaz reportedly expects to incur a loss of 280 million leva in 2024.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 25 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations, arrears workout, or arbitration proceed without an explicit termination. Bulgargaz continues to withhold full payment; BOTAS may suspend services or pursue claims but refrains from declaring the agreement cancelled. Bulgarian officials voice opposition and seek to amend terms, yet stop short of a formal cancellation announcement before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either party publicly announces termination: (1) Bulgargaz/the Bulgarian government declares the contract cancelled (e.g., for financial impossibility, illegality, or political decision), or (2) BOTAS terminates for prolonged non‑payment or failure to meet contractual obligations, announcing cancellation to the press or via official channels.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and large cross‑border gas contracts rarely get cancelled abruptly. The base case favors inertia: complex legal/financial exposure, likely arbitration clauses, and the need to maintain regional gas logistics all push toward negotiation or interim arrangements rather than a formal cancellation in the next few weeks.\n\nEvidence and context influencing the forecast:\n- The agreement (signed Jan 2023) is 13 years with take‑or‑pay reportedly around $580k/day. Bulgargaz ceased payments since July 2024, with arrears around 4 billion leva (~€2b), and expects a large loss. Officials say Bulgargaz lacks capacity to pay. These raise the pressure to exit or restructure but also increase the legal/financial stakes of a unilateral cancellation.\n- Political pressure exists (e.g., Borissov publicly calling to get out), which raises risk of a political move. However, translating rhetoric into a formal termination within weeks typically requires board/government resolutions, formal notices, and a communications plan—often longer than the remaining window.\n- BOTAS could terminate for nonpayment. Yet if they believed termination maximized recovery or leverage, they likely would have moved earlier; holding the contract while pursuing collection can be preferable. A sudden termination in June would likely require a specific trigger (missed cure deadline, failure to post security) and a choice by BOTAS to announce.\n\nWhy not higher: Legal/financial complexity, the tendency to renegotiate, and the short time left reduce odds of a decisive cancellation announcement by July 1. Stakeholders often prefer standstill agreements or partial settlements over rupture.\nWhy not lower: The arrears are very large, nonpayment has persisted for ~11 months, and political statements increase the chance of a decisive break. Either side could decide that the current path is unsustainable and announce termination to reset negotiations or contain losses.\n\nWhat would move me higher: Credible reports of a termination notice already sent or scheduled; cabinet/board agendas explicitly to cancel; statements from Bulgaria’s energy minister or Bulgargaz CEO signaling imminent cancellation; BOTAS issuing a final cure notice with a June deadline.\nWhat would move me lower: News of a bridge financing deal, EU-backed support, interim amendment to terms, a formal standstill, or BOTAS publicly committing to keep the contract in force while pursuing arbitration/collection.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Botas Gas Agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey be cancelled before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Borissov to Erdogan: Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal](https://www.novinite.com/articles/232423/Borissov+to+Erdogan%3A+Bulgaria+Needs+Out+of+the+Botas+Gas+Deal) | [Bulgargaz on verge of bankrupty due to debts to Turkish gas company BOTAS: Turkish media](https://www.turkiyetoday.com/business/bulgargaz-on-verge-of-bankrupty-due-to-debts-to-turkish-gas-company-botas-turkish-med-3201881)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, the natural gas transmission agreement between Bulgargaz EAD and BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corp is announced by either party as being cancelled.\n\nTermination of the agreement by either side, even if denied by the other side, would still count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe 13-year gas transmission agreement between Bulgaria’s state-owned gas company Bulgargaz and Turkey’s BOTAŞ was signed in January 2023.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
