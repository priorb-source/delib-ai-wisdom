  "information": "The 51st G7 Summit is scheduled to take place in Kananaskis, Alberta. Security measures are being implemented, including a controlled access zone around summit venues from June 10-18 and temporary airspace restrictions. In advance of the leaders' summit, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell attended preparatory G7 meetings in Banff. Historically, sitting U.S. presidents have attended every in-person G7/G8 summit since its inception in 1975.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 7-15 days. The G7 Summit is scheduled to begin June 10, 2025 and run through June 18, 2025. Today is June 3, 2025, so we are 7 days from the start and 15 days from the end of the summit window.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Trump attends the summit. The White House has officially confirmed his attendance, security preparations are already underway in Kananaskis, and we are only one week from the summit start date. This aligns with 50 years of unbroken precedent.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump experiences a sudden health emergency, serious family crisis, or a major national security event (terrorist attack, military conflict) that requires his immediate presence in Washington. Alternatively, a last-minute political dispute with Canada or security threat could prevent attendance, though this would be highly unusual given the advanced stage of preparations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump follows through on the White House confirmation and travels to Kananaskis, Alberta as planned. He attends the summit meetings from June 10-18, meeting in person with other G7 leaders including those from Canada, UK, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan. Security preparations proceed smoothly and no major crises intervene.",
    "rationale": "The evidence overwhelmingly supports Trump attending this summit. The White House has officially confirmed his attendance per the CTV article. Security measures including controlled access zones and airspace restrictions are already being implemented for June 10-18. U.S. officials have attended preparatory meetings in Banff, indicating serious planning is underway. Most compellingly, there is 50 years of unbroken precedent - every sitting U.S. president has attended every in-person G7/G8 summit since 1975. We are now only 7 days from the summit start, making last-minute cancellations increasingly unlikely. The proximity to the event and official confirmation are very strong signals. However, several factors prevent this from being higher than 91%: Trump is known for unpredictable decisions and last-minute changes; health emergencies or national security crises, while unlikely, are possible; there remains a full week for unexpected events. The forecast isn't lower because official White House confirmation is extremely reliable evidence, the extensive preparations already underway represent significant commitment, and the historical precedent is perfect over 50 years. To update higher, I would need to see Trump already en route to Canada or additional confirmation of specific schedule details. To update lower, I would need reports of cancellation considerations, emerging U.S.-Canada tensions, health concerns, or a major crisis requiring his presence in Washington.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
