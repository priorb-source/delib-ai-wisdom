    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that strengthen the case for status quo. The most powerful point they raise, which I didn't emphasize enough, is that Niger's advisory wasn't updated after the July 2023 military coup. This is extremely telling - a coup is typically a major trigger event that prompts review and potential escalation. The fact that the State Department left Niger at Level 3 despite this upheaval demonstrates a very high threshold for nationwide Level 4 designation. Forecaster 2's point about the 'nuanced approach' with regional Level 4 zones is also important - the State Department has already calibrated risk geographically, suggesting a deliberate choice not to apply a blanket nationwide restriction. Both forecasters correctly emphasize that only 21 countries globally have Level 4 status, reinforcing how rare this designation is. Their convergence on 18% seems well-reasoned.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm convinced to update my forecast downward from 20% to 18%. The July 2023 coup is the critical piece of evidence - this was a major event that should have triggered review and potential elevation, yet the advisory remained at Level 3. This demonstrates that the State Department has recent information about Niger and consciously decided against upgrading to Level 4. Combined with the State Department's deliberate use of regional Level 4 designations (showing they can and do calibrate risk geographically rather than defaulting to nationwide warnings), the case for status quo is even stronger than I initially assessed. The 60-day timeframe remains very short for policy shifts absent specific trigger events like personnel evacuations or major terrorist attacks targeting Americans. However, I'm maintaining some probability (18% rather than going lower) because: the Sahel region remains genuinely volatile, the advisory is over 2 years old which is unusual, and unexpected deterioration triggering evacuation orders remains possible as demonstrated by South Sudan's March 2025 upgrade. The historical pattern and coup evidence strongly favor Level 3 continuation, but regional instability prevents near-certainty.",
