  "information": "Historical price data for bananas in the U.S. shows relative stability. The price was reported as 63 cents per pound in 2022, 62.1 cents in January 2025, and 62.5 cents in March 2025. An analysis of price trends between 2005 and 2025 indicates that banana prices experienced a modest increase of 23.5%, one of the smallest increases compared to other consumer goods like beef (136%) and chicken (94%) over the same period.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-5 weeks. We are currently on May 13, 2025, so May is half over. The BLS typically releases monthly price data 2-3 weeks after month-end, meaning the May 2025 data should be available in mid-June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the price would be under 63 cents. Recent data shows banana prices at 62.1 cents in January 2025 and 62.5 cents in March 2025. If current trends continue without significant disruption, the May price would likely remain in the 62-63 cent range.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A price spike driven by the factors mentioned in the Quartz article materializes quickly - port fees increase, Trump tariffs on banana imports take effect, or supply chain disruptions occur. A disease outbreak affecting banana production or transportation bottlenecks could push May prices to 63.0 cents or higher. Even a modest increase of 0.5-0.8 cents from the March level would result in a No outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Banana prices continue their historical pattern of stability. The March 2025 price of 62.5 cents holds steady or increases only marginally through May. The structural factors that have kept banana price increases modest (only 23.5% from 2005-2025) remain in place, and any price pressures mentioned in the article either don't materialize or take longer to flow through to retail prices.",
    "rationale": "This forecast heavily weights the status quo given we are already halfway through May 2025, which dramatically reduces uncertainty. The most recent data points show prices at 62.1 cents (January) and 62.5 cents (March), indicating a slight upward drift of approximately 0.2 cents per month. Extrapolating this trend would put May around 62.9 cents, still under the 63.0 cent threshold. The historical analysis showing banana prices increased only 23.5% from 2005-2025 (compared to 136% for beef) demonstrates remarkable stability, suggesting structural market factors resist rapid price changes. However, the Quartz article warning about port fees, tariffs, and price hikes introduces downside risk. The key uncertainty is whether these pressures have already impacted early May prices, which we don't yet have data for. The threshold is tight - we're asking whether prices will rise by 0.5-0.8 cents from March levels. Given that half of May has already passed with presumably stable pricing (or we'd likely have heard about dramatic increases), and given banana pricing historically changes slowly, the status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. My forecast is not higher because we're very close to the threshold and the mentioned price pressures could manifest in the data. It's not lower because we're halfway through May with no reported price shocks, historical stability is strong, and large movements would be unusual. I would revise upward with evidence of early May prices at or below 62.5 cents, or downward with news of supply disruptions or confirmed price increases in May data.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the price of bananas reported by the US BLS for May 2025 be under 63 cents a pound?\n\nQuestion background:\nQuartz: [Move over, eggs – bananas are the next victim](https://qz.com/bananas-dole-price-hikes-inflation-port-fees-trump-tari-1851772583)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
