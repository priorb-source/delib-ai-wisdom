    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 45 days, until the deadline of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, May 16, 2025, the Starlink availability map does not list Sri Lanka as 'Available.' It is currently designated as a future service area.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the license being granted in August 2024, final logistical and administrative tasks, such as the setup and commissioning of ground station gateways or final spectrum coordination, encounter minor delays. These delays push the official service launch just past the June 30, 2025 deadline into the third quarter of 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "With the major regulatory approval secured in 2024, SpaceX and its local partners finalize the last of the operational requirements in late May or early June 2025. The ground infrastructure is activated, and Starlink updates its availability map to show Sri Lanka as 'Available' for orders before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is centered on the timeline. The most significant positive indicator is the official granting of a license to Starlink by Sri Lanka's regulator in August 2024, as reported by Reuters. This action removed the largest barrier to entry. However, a significant negative indicator is the passage of time: nine months have elapsed since that approval without the service going live. With only about 45 days remaining until the deadline, the prolonged delay suggests that the remaining logistical and administrative hurdles are more time-consuming than initially anticipated, or that Sri Lanka is not a top deployment priority for SpaceX. While a launch in the next month and a half is certainly possible, the status quo has been one of slow progress. Therefore, it is more likely that this slow pace will continue, pushing the launch just beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline, rather than an acceleration to meet it. My forecast is not lower than 40% because the primary license has been granted, and all remaining work is operational. An announcement could come any day. My forecast is not higher because the nine-month delay since licensing is strong evidence that the rollout is not proceeding rapidly, making the short 45-day window a very tight target. I would increase my forecast upon news of ground station completions or a specific launch announcement from Starlink. I would decrease it if any new regulatory or political challenges were reported.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Sri Lanka as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Musk's Starlink wins Sri Lanka licence](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/sri-lanka-regulator-grants-licence-musks-starlink-satellite-broadband-2024-08-13/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Sri Lanka listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
