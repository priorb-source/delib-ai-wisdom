    "review": "Both forecasters emphasized the distinction between political “final approval” and the operational milestone that flips the Starlink map to “Available” (i.e., formal license issuance, type approval, import/logistics, and payments). They also highlighted Bangladesh-specific frictions (regulated environment, potential lawful-intercept or gateway expectations) and the risk that early deployments could be limited to government/enterprise before consumer availability is reflected on the public map. These are solid points and refine my earlier view, which leaned a bit too much on the headline approval and Starlink’s technical readiness. I also find persuasive the point about website update lag and the need for commercial readiness (pricing/order page) rather than mere regulatory headline. The Indonesia analogy is plausible but not necessarily transferable to Bangladesh’s regulatory style.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~45 days. The reported leadership-level “final approval” is a positive signal, but the critical uncertainty is whether BTRC has already issued the operative licenses and type approvals and whether Starlink has import, tax, and billing set up. Bangladesh’s regulatory posture likely requires clear lawful-intercept compliance and could prefer a domestic landing arrangement; if that or other formalities are pending, slippage past July 1 is common. Conversely, if the approval has in fact translated into executed licenses and Starlink has prepped logistics, a June availability flip is feasible given Starlink’s recent cadence in some Asian markets. Given the short runway and typical bureaucratic friction, I’m shading down from my prior 58%. I still keep it near even odds because the political green light is a strong directional indicator and Starlink can technically activate without a local gateway if permitted. Net: balanced odds with a slight execution-risk tilt to No absent concrete signs (license publication, order page, terminals clearing customs) in the next couple of weeks.",
