    "review": "The three forecasts show remarkable consensus (65%, 65%, 68%), suggesting we're all reasoning from the same limited information base. Forecaster 2 provided useful specificity about metro populations (LA ~13M, Bay Area ~7-8M, San Diego ~3M), which helps anchor the plausibility of reaching 20M if major centers are affected. Forecaster 3 made a valuable observation that 'already bad' is subjective language. However, all three analyses share the same critical weakness: we're forecasting without current baseline data from the Drought Monitor. This means we're essentially guessing whether the threshold is already met, nearly met, or still distant. One detail I'm now weighing more carefully: the article says drought has 'returned,' which implies it previously went away. This could suggest the drought is a recent development, meaning we might not yet be at 20 million residents affected. If true, reaching 20M in just 30 days while possible, becomes less certain than if we were already at or near that threshold. Conversely, 'already bad' suggests substantial current impact, and the timing (late May entering peak dry season) strongly favors persistence or worsening rather than improvement.",
    "rationale": "My original reasoning remains sound but I'm now more attuned to the tension between 'returned' (suggests recent, possibly still developing) and 'already bad' (suggests substantial current impact). The consensus around 65-68% validates that this range appropriately balances: (1) Strong persistence factors - 30-day timeframe, dry season timing, and (2) Uncertainty about current baseline - we don't know if we're at 10M, 15M, 18M, or already above 20M. The metro population breakdown confirms 20M is achievable if drought affects major centers. Without actual current data, I cannot justify moving significantly from my original assessment. The forecasts would be much higher (80%+) if we knew current figures were 18-19M, or much lower (40-50%) if currently only 10-12M. At 65%, I'm expressing moderate confidence that conditions persist at or above threshold, while acknowledging meaningful uncertainty about the current baseline.",
