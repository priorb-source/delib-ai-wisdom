  "information": "According to NOAA data cited in reports, the warmest May on record was in 2020 with a temperature anomaly of +0.95°C versus the 1901-2000 mean, followed by 2016 at +0.93°C. For the current year, preliminary data showed January 2025 was the hottest January on record, March 2025 ranked first or tied for first, and April 2025 ranked as the second warmest. The first three months of 2025 were the second-warmest first quarter recorded. The strong El Niño event that persisted from May 2023 to April 2024 has transitioned to a neutral ENSO (El Niño–Southern Oscillation) state.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. NOAA typically releases monthly global temperature data in the middle of the following month, so May 2025 data should be published around mid-June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "May 2025 ranks as the warmest May on record, continuing the trend of exceptional warmth seen in early 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May 2025's temperature anomaly falls below the current record of +0.95°C set in May 2020, ranking it second or lower. This could occur if the transition from El Niño to ENSO neutral conditions resulted in cooler ocean temperatures during May, or if regional cooling patterns balanced out the global average despite continued warming in some areas.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "May 2025's temperature anomaly exceeds +0.95°C above the 1901-2000 mean, breaking the 2020 record. This would continue the pattern of exceptional warmth seen throughout early 2025, with the long-term warming trend and residual heat from the previous El Niño event sufficient to push May 2025 into first place despite ENSO neutral conditions.",
    "rationale": "The evidence presents a compelling but mixed picture. On one hand, 2025 has been extraordinarily warm: January was the hottest January on record, March ranked first or tied for first, and April was the second warmest April. This exceptional start strongly suggests May could continue the trend. The first quarter being second-warmest on record indicates sustained high temperatures. The long-term climate warming trend provides additional upward pressure on temperatures. However, several factors temper my confidence. The transition from El Niño to ENSO neutral is significant - El Niño conditions typically enhance global temperatures, and the May 2020 record occurred during different ENSO conditions. April 2025 ranking second rather than first shows that not every month in 2025 is setting absolute records. Natural climate variability means even in a warming world, individual months can deviate from trends. The margin is tight - May 2025 would need to exceed +0.95°C, requiring only a small difference to break the record but also meaning a small shortfall would result in a No outcome. My forecast is not higher because the ENSO neutral transition typically reduces warming potential compared to El Niño years, creating uncertainty about whether May can match the 2020 conditions. The fact that April was second rather than first suggests some moderation. My forecast is not lower because the persistent warmth across multiple months in 2025 is a very strong signal, and the background warming trend makes breaking temperature records increasingly likely over time. I would update upward with any preliminary May 2025 data showing exceptional warmth or evidence that typical ENSO transition cooling didn't materialize. I would update downward with preliminary data suggesting lower anomalies or evidence of significant regional cooling patterns in May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA report that May 2025 is the hottest May on record?\n\nQuestion background:\n[NOAA Climate change impacts](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NOAA at its [Climate at a Glance Global Rankings](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/rankings/globe/tavg/land_ocean/202504) tracker reports that May 2025 is the 1st warmest on record.\n\nEnsure that Region is set to Global. Ensure that Surface is set to Land and Ocean.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to NOAA data cited in reports, the warmest May on record was in 2020 with a temperature anomaly of +0.95°C versus the 1901-2000 mean, followed by 2016 at +0.93°C.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
