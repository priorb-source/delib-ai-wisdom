  "information": "For its upcoming first quarter 2025 earnings report, scheduled for May 12, 2025, analysts expect GoPro to report a quarterly loss of approximately $0.13 per share on revenues of around $124.9 million, which would represent a year-over-year revenue decline of about 19.6%. The company itself has stated it expects unit sales and revenue in 2025 to be lower than in 2024, citing macroeconomic headwinds and competition. In response, the company has initiated plans to reduce operating expenses by nearly 30% during 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 53 days (from May 9, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - GoPro does not file for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GoPro successfully implements its 30% operating expense reduction plan, maintains sufficient liquidity through cost management, secures adequate access to credit facilities if needed, and continues operations through the restructuring period without requiring bankruptcy protection. The Q1 2025 results on May 12 show adequate cash reserves to weather the current downturn.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GoPro faces an acute liquidity crisis, possibly revealed in the May 12 Q1 earnings report, where cash reserves prove insufficient to meet immediate debt obligations or operational needs. The company cannot secure additional financing or credit extensions, and management determines that bankruptcy protection is the only viable path to restructure operations and obligations.",
    "rationale": "The base rate for bankruptcy filings among public companies in any 2-month period is extremely low, even among struggling companies. My research assistant indicates GoPro is facing significant challenges: expected Q1 2025 revenue decline of 19.6% year-over-year, continued losses ($0.13/share), and the need for drastic 30% operating expense cuts. However, several factors suggest bankruptcy is unlikely in this timeframe: (1) The company just filed Q4 2024 results and is planning actively for 2025, indicating ongoing operations; (2) They have a proactive cost-reduction plan rather than appearing to be in crisis mode; (3) There is no indication in the available information of immediate debt defaults, covenant violations, or liquidity crises; (4) The timeline is very short - companies typically show more warning signs before bankruptcy filing. Why not higher: No evidence of imminent cash crunch, debt default, or loss of credit access. The company is taking corrective action, which suggests management believes they can avoid bankruptcy. Why not lower: Significant financial stress is evident (major revenue decline, losses, need for dramatic cost cuts). We lack full visibility into debt obligations, covenant compliance, and exact cash position. The Q1 results on May 12 could reveal worse-than-expected conditions. I would update higher if: Q1 results show critical cash shortfalls, covenant violations are reported, restructuring advisors are hired, or creditor payment issues emerge. I would update lower if: Q1 shows adequate cash reserves, successful refinancing is announced, or cost cuts show early positive results.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill GoPro file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and 2024 Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000150043525000003/gpro2024-12x31exh991xer.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFor its upcoming first quarter 2025 earnings report, scheduled for May 12, 2025, analysts expect GoPro to report a quarterly loss of approximately $0.13 per share on revenues of around $124.9 million, which would represent a year-over-year revenue decline of about 19.6%.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
