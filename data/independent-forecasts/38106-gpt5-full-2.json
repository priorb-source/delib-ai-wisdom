  "information": "A Russian delegation is scheduled to visit Istanbul on June 2, 2025, for a second round of peace talks with Ukraine. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitriy Peskov stated that a high-level summit involving President Trump would depend on the achievement of results from these direct talks between the two delegations. Russia proposed the June 2 date, following a previous meeting on May 16. The United States will not send an official delegation, but White House press secretary Caroline Levitt said, 'We will let you know if the President has plans to send a representative.'\n\nIn February 2025, there was media speculation, particularly from French sources, about a potential visit by Donald Trump to Moscow for the Victory Day celebrations on May 9, 2025. Former Russian Prime Minister Sergey Stepanov commented at the time that such a visit would be a 'big sensation.' On February 12, 2025, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a 1.5-hour phone call during which they agreed to a personal meeting and extended mutual invitations to Washington and Moscow. The speculated May 9 visit did not occur.\n\nIn late May 2025, following a major Russian drone and missile attack in Ukraine, President Donald Trump referred to President Vladimir Putin as 'absolutely crazy.' In a separate statement, Trump also expressed his disappointment with Putin's continued attacks, saying, 'I am very disappointed, very, very disappointed.' Trump indicated he would observe Russia's intentions over a two-week period to determine if they were genuine about achieving peace.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (now through June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No visit occurs before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Russia–Ukraine talks on June 2 (and follow-ons) yield little or partial progress; any high-level meeting is held in a neutral venue (e.g., Istanbul) or Washington rather than Russia, or is scheduled for July or later. The White House makes no advance or pool notice of travel to Russia, and domestic/political optics keep a Russia trip off the table.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid, material breakthrough emerges from the June talks leading to a ceasefire/roadmap, and both sides decide on a high-visibility signing or summit in Moscow or St. Petersburg in mid-to-late June; Trump makes a short-notice, tightly secured visit to Russia to finalize or announce the deal.",
    "rationale": "- Time window is short and logistics for a presidential visit are complex. Such trips typically have advance planning and public or pool guidance; none is evident. \n- Optics and politics: A US presidential visit to Russia during ongoing hostilities would be extraordinarily controversial absent a clear peace breakthrough. Even with progress, a neutral site is more likely than Moscow. \n- Research assistant highlights: (1) Kremlin says any high-level summit with Trump depends on results of the June 2 direct talks; (2) prior speculation about a May 9 Moscow visit did not materialize; (3) after recent Russian attacks, Trump publicly called Putin “absolutely crazy” and said he’d watch for two weeks—signaling caution rather than eagerness to travel; (4) the US is not sending an official delegation to the June 2 talks, further suggesting limited near-term engagement at the highest level. \n- Why not higher: No travel signals, tight timeline, strong domestic/optical constraints, and the likelihood that any early summit would be neutral-ground or US-hosted. \n- Why not lower: Trump’s appetite for high-profile, surprise diplomacy; mutual invitations exchanged in February; the Kremlin’s stated openness to a summit contingent on results; a peace breakthrough could create incentives for a swift, headline-grabbing Moscow visit. \n- What would move me up: Clear, credible reports of major progress in the June talks; official or well-sourced leaks about a summit in Russia; sudden shifts in White House/Moscow messaging or logistical indicators (e.g., pool notices, NOTAMs, advance teams). \n- What would move me down: Talks stall or shift to prolonged technical negotiations; announcements of any summit in a neutral location or Washington; renewed escalations and hostile rhetoric making a visit politically untenable within June.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
