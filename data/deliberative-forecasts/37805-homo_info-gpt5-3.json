    "review": "Forecaster 2’s key upside hinge is whether FlightsFrom lists inter-island (TIQ/ROP) services. That’s a useful angle I hadn’t explicitly separated, but I’m skeptical: FlightsFrom generally reflects OAG/IATA-loaded scheduled services, and historically SPN’s page has not shown TIQ/ROP (often operated by small, non-IATA carriers). If those do not appear, their 64% seems too high because you still need NRT plus one more international city to clear >4. Their point that NRT often operates in peak summer is fair and nudges the NRT-in-July probability up.\n\nForecaster 3 adds the Hong Kong Airlines possibility. I see that as a low-probability catalyst by July 1 without prior, visible schedule loading/announcements, and the window is tight. Their baseline framing (≤4 barring a new Korean/Japan secondary city) aligns more with my prior. The yen headwind and CNMI’s demand constraints also support a conservative stance.\n\nNet: I find F2’s reliance on inter-island listing unconvincing; F3’s reasoning is closer to my view with a small upside tail (HKG or a Korean secondary), but still limited by timing and lack of firm evidence.",
    "rationale": "Status quo as of mid-May looks like 3 solid destinations (GUM, ICN, PUS) with NRT an uncertain seasonal add. To reach >4, SPN likely needs NRT plus at least one additional scheduled international destination listed on FlightsFrom (e.g., a Korean secondary city) or for FlightsFrom to count TIQ/ROP. I assign low odds to TIQ/ROP being listed (historically absent) and modest odds to a new scheduled international city materializing by July without prior announcements. I slightly increase the probability that NRT is present in July (peak-season pattern), but that still leaves the hurdle of one more destination. Given these offsets, I make only a small downward adjustment from my prior 18% to 17%.\n\nWhat would move me up: (1) FlightsFrom showing TIQ/ROP as scheduled destinations; (2) confirmed OAG loading for UA NRT–SPN in July and one additional scheduled city (e.g., a Korean secondary) before July 1. What would move me down: evidence that NRT is not operating in July or that PUS is paused around the summer timetable cut, with no new routes loaded.",
