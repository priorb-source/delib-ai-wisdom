    "review": "My initial forecast of 75% was driven by the resolution criteria, where only a single day without the word 'tariff(s)' in both papers' front pages would result in a 'Yes'. I reasoned that the 23-day window made it statistically likely that such a day would occur. The other forecasters have convinced me that this reasoning was flawed. Both forecasters raised the crucial point, which I had under-weighted, of the story's extremely high and peaking salience. They correctly centered their analysis on the recency and magnitude of the April 2 executive order, which has kicked off numerous front-page-worthy consequences (consumer stockpiling, Treasury borrowing changes, etc.). Their argument that the Wall Street Journal, given its mission, is almost certain to cover this massive economic story daily is particularly persuasive. This makes the probability of a 'clean day' (where both papers omit the word) extremely low on any given day. Their reasoning, grounded in the specific context of the provided report, is much more robust than my more abstract statistical argument. I find their analyses highly convincing and agree that a significant update to my forecast is necessary.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward from 75% to 18%. My initial analysis over-weighted the 'one success in 23 days' structure of the question and failed to account for the exceptional news value of this specific tariff story at this specific time. The other forecasters persuasively argued that the recent, sweeping executive order on tariffs has made it the dominant, ongoing economic and political story.\n\nThe probability of a 'No' outcome rests on the word 'tariff(s)' appearing in at least one of the two front pages every single day for the 23-day period. The strongest driver for this is the Wall Street Journal. A major tariff overhaul is a core story for a business-focused paper, and it is highly probable that its front page will feature some aspect of it daily, from market reactions to corporate impacts. For a 'Yes' to occur, there must be a day where the WSJ *and* the NYT simultaneously have no front-page mention. This would likely require both a lack of new developments in the tariff story and the emergence of a different, more powerful news event that consumes the attention of both editorial boards. \n\nGiven the story's current peak intensity, the daily probability of such a 'clean day' is very low. However, over a 23-day period that includes three weekends (which can have lighter news cycles), a single anomalous day is not impossible. My updated forecast of 18% reflects my new belief that 'No' is the much more likely outcome, while still acknowledging the non-trivial chance that a random, major news event or a quiet news weekend could create the single 'clean day' needed for a 'Yes' resolution.",
