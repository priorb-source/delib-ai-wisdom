  "information": "As of May 2, 2025, Tanzania holds a Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution travel advisory from the US State Department, last updated on September 9, 2024. The advisory cites crime, terrorism, and the targeting of LGBTQI+ persons as primary concerns. While the country is at Level 2 overall, specific regions such as Mtwara have a higher, Level 3 warning. In March 2025, the US Embassy issued an alert regarding coastal security.\n\nSeveral other countries in the region or with similar risk profiles have recently been elevated to Level 3. Uganda's advisory was raised due to terrorism risks, political demonstrations, and discriminatory laws. Burundi's Level 3 advisory cites violent crimes like grenade attacks and armed robbery targeting foreigners. The State Department also reissued a Level 3 alert for Bangladesh due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism, and issued a Level 3 warning for Trinidad and Tobago following a surge in violent crime and a declared state of emergency.\n\nThe US State Department's travel advisory system consists of four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). Advisories are regularly reviewed and can be upgraded due to factors like a significant deterioration in security, increased terrorist activity, political instability, or civil unrest. A notable security concern for Tanzania is the insurgency in Mozambique's Niassa Reserve, which borders the country. Terrorist activity linked to Islamic extremism was reported in the area as recently as April 2025, creating potential spillover risks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Tanzania maintains its current Level 2 advisory status through July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tanzania continues under its Level 2 advisory through July 1, 2025. While periodic security alerts may be issued and localized concerns persist (particularly in Mtwara region), no major security incident or pattern of deteriorating conditions triggers a full country-wide upgrade to Level 3. The State Department determines current measures adequately reflect the risk environment.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant security event occurs - such as a major terrorist attack, series of violent crimes targeting foreigners, substantial spillover from the Mozambique insurgency, or acute political instability - prompting the US State Department to upgrade Tanzania's entire country advisory to Level 3 before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a NO outcome. Tanzania has held a Level 2 advisory since at least September 2024 (8 months ago), and travel advisory changes are relatively infrequent, requiring substantial justification. The State Department has already acknowledged the key risk factors (crime, terrorism, LGBTQI+ targeting) in the current Level 2 advisory, and despite these concerns persisting, no upgrade has occurred.\n\nHowever, several factors create non-negligible risk of an upgrade: (1) The Mtwara region already holds a Level 3 designation, showing the Department recognizes serious localized risks; (2) The March 2025 coastal security alert indicates ongoing active concerns; (3) Regional pattern of upgrades for similar countries (Uganda, Burundi) suggests the Department is actively reviewing East African security; (4) Recent terrorist activity in Mozambique's border region (April 2025) creates spillover risk.\n\nThe 60-day timeframe is relatively short for such changes. Travel advisory upgrades typically require either a dramatic triggering event (major attack, coup, etc.) or a sustained pattern of deterioration. While Tanzania faces real security challenges, it hasn't crossed the threshold despite months of monitoring. The country also has significant tourism infrastructure and economic importance, which may factor into advisory decisions.\n\nMy forecast isn't higher because: most advisory levels remain stable absent major events; 8 months have passed without upgrade despite known risks; Tanzania's tourism importance creates institutional inertia; the short timeframe makes change statistically less likely.\n\nMy forecast isn't lower because: regional instability is real and growing; Mtwara's Level 3 shows recognized serious risks; recent alerts suggest active monitoring; similar countries have been upgraded recently.\n\nI would revise upward if: a major terrorist attack occurs in Tanzania; multiple serious incidents target foreigners; significant Mozambique spillover violence; acute political crisis emerges. I would revise downward if: weeks pass without significant incidents; the Department reissues an updated Level 2 advisory; regional security improves.",
