  "information": "As of early June 2025, Sudan has not ratified the AfCFTA agreement nor submitted its Provisional Schedule of Tariff Concessions. The country is in an ongoing civil war, resulting in fragmented government, the absence of a functioning legislature, and suspension from the African Union (AU). Despite the conflict, a draft national AfCFTA implementation strategy for Sudan was previously reviewed and validated by stakeholders in a process supported by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).\n\nAcross Africa, 47 of the 54 signatory nations had ratified the AfCFTA agreement as of July 2024. However, overall implementation of the trade area since its 2021 launch has been described as sluggish. According to trade policy analysts, key impediments include production-related challenges like low industrial output, poor infrastructure, and non-tariff barriers. The original goal of removing tariffs on 90% of goods has been pushed back to 2034.\n\nA recent UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) report highlighted the AfCFTA's potential to boost trade-led growth and increase Africa's GDP by 1.2% by 2045 with full implementation. Other regional developments include a forum in Zambia focused on digital trade integration, an emphasis on arbitration for resolving trade disputes, and the promotion of the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) to facilitate transactions in local currencies. Meanwhile, Nigeria has ratified the agreement, and South Africa and Lesotho are strengthening bilateral trade ties to advance AfCFTA goals.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "25 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Sudan's ongoing civil war and the absence of a functioning, recognized legislature make ratification of an international treaty impossible.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The civil war in Sudan continues through June 2025. No stable, unified government with a functioning legislature is formed, and the de facto authorities remain focused on the conflict. The legal and political machinery required for treaty ratification is therefore absent, and the deadline passes without Sudan ratifying the AfCFTA.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In an extremely unlikely series of events, a comprehensive peace deal is signed and implemented within the next few days. A transitional government of national unity is rapidly formed, including a legislative body with the authority to ratify treaties. This new government, in a bid to gain international legitimacy, prioritizes and completes the ratification process in the few weeks remaining before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is overwhelmingly driven by the current political and security situation in Sudan. The country is in a state of civil war, which has resulted in a fragmented government, the collapse of state institutions, including a functioning legislature, and suspension from the African Union. The ratification of an international trade agreement like AfCFTA is a formal legal process that requires a stable and recognized government with the legislative capacity to enact it. Sudan currently lacks this fundamental prerequisite. The information that a draft implementation strategy was previously reviewed is now obsolete due to the severe escalation of the conflict. With less than a month until the deadline, the status quo of intense conflict and institutional collapse makes ratification a practical impossibility.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 1% because forecasters should avoid absolute certainty. There is a non-zero, albeit minuscule, chance of a 'black swan' event, such as a sudden, miraculous peace accord that leads to the rapid formation of a government. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the barriers are immense and the timeframe is extremely short. Even if a peace deal were signed today, the logistical and political process of forming a government and then completing the multi-step ratification process before July 1 is not credible.\n\nI would update my forecast higher only upon seeing credible evidence of an immediate, comprehensive peace deal and the instant formation of a functional legislative body. Conversely, any news of escalating conflict would only reinforce the current high-confidence 'No' forecast.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
