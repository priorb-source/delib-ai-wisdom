    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 48 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — energystar.gov is currently up per IsItDownRightNow, and government sites typically persist absent active decommissioning.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "EPA rapidly decommissions the domain before July 1 (e.g., DNS removed or servers turned off), or there is a coincidental transient/network outage exactly when Metaculus performs its check, leading IsItDownRightNow to report it as down.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The site remains online (possibly frozen, with a sunsetting notice, or even redirecting but still responding), consistent with typical federal inertia, archival/records obligations, and stakeholder pushback, so IsItDownRightNow reports it as reachable on or after July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: As of May 7, IsItDownRightNow reports energystar.gov is up. With ~7 weeks to go, the status quo favors a Yes. Government web properties, especially long-running, public-facing programs, are rarely taken offline abruptly; decommissioning typically requires coordination, approvals, and archival steps.\n- Program elimination vs. website availability: Even if the administration moves to eliminate Energy Star (per the May 6 NYT report), the website could persist as an archive or static reference for months. Federal records and continuity practices often keep domains resolving during transitions. Energy Star has DOE/EPA ties and extensive external reliance (manufacturers, utilities, procurement), which increases the likelihood of a freeze/notice rather than an immediate shutdown.\n- Resolution mechanics: The criterion depends on IsItDownRightNow reporting the site as reachable. A redirect would likely still be detected as “up,” reducing the chance that a soft sunset yields a No. The main risks are (1) an explicit, rapid takedown of the domain/servers by July 1, and/or (2) bad timing causing a transient outage when Metaculus checks.\n- Why not higher: The administration could deliberately take the site down quickly to signal the program’s end, timing it before July 1. There is also small but nonzero measurement/uptime risk at the exact check time.\n- Why not lower: Federal inertia, archival requirements, and common practice to post sunsetting notices rather than kill domains outright within weeks. The short time horizon further favors continuity.\n- What would move me up: Public indication that EPA/OMB will retain the site (even as an archive), DNS records showing long-dated renewals, or statements about a transition/redirect plan rather than a shutdown.\n- What would move me down: Official EPA announcement of an imminent takedown before July 1, observable DNS decommissioning steps, sustained outages, or reports that the domain will be retired immediately.\n- Research assistant info: No additional info beyond current uptime; this supports leaning on the status quo.\n",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
