    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I diverge significantly. They anchor heavily on license approval as the primary barrier and interpret the 7-month elapsed time as evidence that launch is 'imminent.' However, this reasoning has a critical flaw: if everything were proceeding normally after license approval, why hasn't Chad appeared on the map yet? The fact that 6+ months have passed WITHOUT activation is itself information - it suggests unexpected obstacles, deprioritization, or complications. Forecaster 2's optimism seems to assume a deterministic timeline (license + time = launch) without adequately explaining the observed delay.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis closely aligns with mine, emphasizing status quo bias given the short remaining window and treating the lack of activation over 6 months as meaningful negative evidence. Their reasoning about drawn-out timelines when initial rollouts don't happen quickly resonates with my concerns.\n\nForecaster 2 does raise one valid point I should weight more heavily: regulatory approval truly is the hardest barrier, and Starlink has shown capability for rapid African expansion. However, 'capability' doesn't equal 'will happen in the next 47 days.' The observed delay suggests Chad may not be prioritized.\n\nThe convergence between my 40% and Forecaster 3's 42% suggests similar analytical frameworks. Forecaster 2's 75% appears to underweight the informational content of the 6-month delay and overweight speculative optimism about 'imminent' launch without supporting evidence.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, I'm making a modest upward adjustment but maintaining my core reasoning. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that license approval is significant and removes the primary regulatory barrier. This deserves more weight than I initially gave it - the achievement of regulatory approval is a real positive signal, and Starlink does have the technical capability to activate service relatively quickly once infrastructure is ready.\n\nHowever, I remain unconvinced by the argument that activation is 'imminent' simply because time has passed. The 6+ month delay since license approval is substantial negative evidence that hasn't been adequately explained. If Chad were a priority market with straightforward deployment, we would likely have seen activation by now. The delay suggests either operational complications, deprioritization due to market size, or unresolved secondary issues.\n\nWith only 47 days remaining, status quo bias remains highly relevant. What isn't available today is statistically more likely to remain unavailable in the near term, especially absent any concrete signals of imminent launch. The lack of announcements, local reports, or map updates pointing to June 2025 availability reinforces this.\n\nI'm adjusting slightly upward from 40% to 43% to account for the possibility that I'm over-indexing on status quo and that Starlink could surprise with a late-June activation. However, the core tension remains: positive regulatory signal versus observed 6-month delay with no evidence of imminent launch.",
