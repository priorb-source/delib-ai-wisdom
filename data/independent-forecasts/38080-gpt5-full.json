  "information": "On May 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the decision was due to Harvard's repeated failure to comply with federal law and reporting requirements. The administration accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. Other justifications cited by DHS included creating an 'unsafe environment' hostile to Jewish students, failing to address incidents of campus harassment, and not providing requested government information regarding the conduct of foreign students.\n\nThe SEVP certification revocation would prohibit Harvard from enrolling new international students holding F or J visas for the 2025-2026 academic year. The decision affects approximately 6,800 current international students, who constitute about 27% of Harvard's student body. These students would be required to transfer to other SEVP-certified institutions or risk losing their legal status in the United States. Following the announcement, the University of Tokyo stated it is considering accepting affected Harvard students, and the Chinese Foreign Ministry pledged to protect the rights of its overseas students.\n\nIn response to the DHS action, Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the administration. On May 23, 2025, a federal judge granted Harvard a temporary restraining order (TRO), which has halted the enforcement of the SEVP certification revocation. As a result of the TRO, Harvard's certification is currently considered active. The university's lawsuit alleges that the administration's actions are unconstitutional retaliation that violates the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. A court hearing to determine whether a preliminary injunction will be issued is scheduled for May 29.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 34 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Harvard’s SEVP certification is currently active under a court TRO; if court relief persists (via extension or a preliminary injunction), it will remain active on July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The district court denies a preliminary injunction on/after May 29 and lets the TRO expire in early June; the First Circuit declines to stay that denial; DHS’s revocation takes effect and Harvard loses SEVP certification before July 1. Alternatively, DHS issues a new, procedurally fortified revocation (e.g., invoking national-security authorities) that survives emergency court challenges, causing certification to lapse before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The court grants a preliminary injunction on/after May 29 (or extends the TRO) and that relief remains in force through July 1 despite any government appeal; or DHS rescinds/settles and restores certification outright before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Key facts from the research assistant: DHS revoked Harvard’s SEVP certification on May 22; Harvard immediately sued and obtained a TRO on May 23 that halted enforcement, leaving certification currently active; a preliminary-injunction hearing is set for May 29. The bar for continuing relief is lower than for ultimate merits, and the equities (irreparable harm to ~6,800 students and the university) strongly favor maintaining the status quo. Procedural vulnerabilities in a sudden revocation (e.g., notice-and-response under 8 CFR 214.3 and APA requirements) and potential First Amendment/APA claims increase Harvard’s odds for a preliminary injunction. The TRO issuance itself signals the judge saw at least serious questions and irreparable harm.\n\nPath to Yes is straightforward: a preliminary injunction (or extended TRO) that persists through July 1. Appellate stays are possible but, given the short runway, less likely to land before July 1 absent compelling national-security showings. Path to No requires the court to deny a preliminary injunction (or dissolve the TRO) and for the government to avoid an appellate stay in Harvard’s favor; or for DHS to reissue a stronger revocation that courts allow to take effect quickly. Those are plausible but face timing and equities headwinds.\n\nWhy not higher: Courts can be deferential to the executive on immigration/national-security matters; the judge could deny the preliminary injunction, or the First Circuit could stay any injunction; DHS could also reissue with bolstered findings to cure APA defects. Any of these could flip the status before July 1.\n\nWhy not lower: The TRO already in place, strong irreparable-harm showing, probable procedural defects, and the short time horizon all favor continued relief through July 1. The balance of equities/public interest for thousands of students typically weighs toward maintaining certification pending litigation.\n\nWhat would move me up: A granted preliminary injunction; explicit TRO extension into July; signals the First Circuit is unlikely to issue a stay; DHS indicating willingness to rescind or settle. What would move me down: Denial of the preliminary injunction; appellate signals of a likely stay; DHS issuing a new revocation invoking national security with a stronger administrative record that a court allows to take effect promptly.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
