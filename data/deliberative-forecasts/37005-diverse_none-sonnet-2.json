    "review": "The other forecasters raise several critical points that I underweighted. Forecaster 2 and 3 both emphasize the concrete reality of sustained double-digit Conservative polling leads, which I mentioned generally but didn't sufficiently emphasize as hard evidence. Forecaster 3's point about incumbency fatigue after a decade in power is particularly compelling—I focused on minority government dynamics but didn't adequately weight the cumulative effect of ten years in office. The regional dynamics point (Bloc in Quebec, Conservative strength in the West) adds important structural barriers I didn't fully consider. Forecaster 3's framework of requiring multiple low-probability events to occur simultaneously is more rigorous than my analysis. However, I find Forecaster 3's 2% somewhat too pessimistic given the six-month horizon and Canada's demonstrated electoral volatility. While the 2015 surge was structurally different (opposition party rising), it does show Canadian voters can shift significantly during campaigns. Forecaster 2's 8% seems more reasonable but may still slightly underweight campaign effects and tail risks. The economic fundamentals (cost of living, housing) that both forecasters emphasize are indeed deeply entrenched issues that represent significant headwinds beyond what I initially weighted.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast downward significantly from 12% to 6%. The key factors driving this revision are: (1) Greater weight on the sustained, substantial polling deficit—not just a temporary dip but a year-plus of consistent Conservative leads; (2) Proper accounting for incumbency fatigue after a decade in power, which is a much stronger headwind than simple minority government dynamics; (3) Recognition that multiple structural factors (economy, regional dynamics, leadership approval) all point in the unfavorable direction simultaneously; (4) The high bar of not just winning but achieving 172+ seats requires overperforming significantly. I'm not going as low as 2% because six months remains a meaningful timeframe where campaigns can matter, leadership changes remain possible, and Canada's multiparty system creates more volatility than typical two-party systems. I maintain that tail-risk scenarios (major opposition scandal, dramatic economic improvement, effective Liberal leadership change) have non-trivial probability even if individually unlikely. My 6% forecast reflects that reaching 172 seats is highly implausible under current conditions but not impossible given time remaining and historical precedents of electoral volatility.",
