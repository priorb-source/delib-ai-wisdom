  "information": "On April 14, 2025, the Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA) granted Starlink Lesotho a 10-year license to operate a satellite network and provide broadband services nationwide. Starlink Lesotho Pty Ltd, owned by Starlink Holdings Netherlands B.V., had submitted its application on January 24, 2025. The LCA had previously rejected a request from Starlink due to concerns over the company's lack of local ownership. The approval followed the imposition of a 50% US tariff on Lesotho in early April 2025. No official timeline for the service launch was provided at the time of the license grant.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 55 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Lesotho is not currently shown as Available on Starlink’s map, and absent action the map would likely remain unchanged by July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Post-license steps (type approval/import clearances, frequency assignments, payment rails, logistics, reseller setup) take longer than expected; Starlink batches Lesotho into a later Africa rollout or prioritizes larger markets, leaving the map at Coming Soon or blank through June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink completes necessary regulatory/operational steps quickly (enables Lesotho in billing/shipping, finalizes local compliance, flips geofence), and updates the availability layer so at least part of Lesotho shows as Available before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Lesotho granted Starlink a 10‑year license on Apr 14, 2025. In many African markets, Starlink has moved from licensing to website availability within weeks to a few months once legal hurdles are cleared. Southern Africa already has extensive Starlink regional coverage, so technical enablement is likely straightforward; the remaining blockers are administrative (type approval/import, spectrum assignments, local entity operations, payments/logistics). The window is ~7–8 weeks, which is tight but consistent with past post-approval timelines in some countries.\n\nWeighting the status quo: the map will not change without deliberate action, so the default is No. However, given recent approval and Starlink’s tendency to activate soon after license in comparable markets, I modestly favor Yes.\n\nWhy not higher: Small market size could reduce prioritization; any additional regulatory conditions (e.g., device type approval, universal service fees) or logistics via South Africa could introduce delays. Starlink sometimes lists countries as Coming Soon for months even after approval.\n\nWhy not lower: License is in hand; coverage likely already exists; enabling the country in Starlink’s systems is operationally simple once compliance is done. Starlink has an incentive to show momentum in Africa and Lesotho’s geography makes for a strong use case.\n\nWhat would move me up: Evidence of terminal type approval published by LCA; Starlink enabling Lesotho as a selectable country for orders; announcements of local distribution/reseller agreements; reports of successful activations near the border using Lesotho billing addresses; Starlink map showing a 2025 (no quarter) label shifting to Available in nearby micro-updates.\n\nWhat would move me down: Indications that additional conditions must be met before commercial launch (e.g., spectrum coordination delays, customs/import holdups, legal challenges), or Starlink communications suggesting a later 2025 launch window.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Lesotho as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lesotho grants license to Musk's Starlink](https://www.ewn.co.za/2025/04/14/lesotho-grants-license-to-musks-starlink)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Lesotho listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn April 14, 2025, the Lesotho Communications Authority (LCA) granted Starlink Lesotho a 10-year license to operate a satellite network and provide broadband services nationwide.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
