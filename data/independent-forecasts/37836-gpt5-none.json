    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Leaning Yes — Erbil typically has low-30s direct destinations in summer; absent major disruptions, it should clear 31.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Seasonal/charter routes don’t appear on flightsfrom.com, a few regional routes are suspended (e.g., to Iran, Lebanon, or Saudi Arabia post-Hajj), or Turkish resort/city services are thinner than usual, leaving ≤31 listed destinations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Peak-summer schedule is fully reflected on flightsfrom.com, including multiple Turkish resort/city routes (IST, SAW, AYT, ADB, ESB, ADA, GZT, TZX, BJV, DLM), stable Gulf links (DXB, SHJ, AUH, DOH, KWI, BAH, MCT), Iraq domestics (BGW, NJF, BSR, possibly ISU), plus a handful of Iran/Levant/Egypt/Europe routes (e.g., IKA, MHD, AMM, BEY, CAI, HBE, VIE), pushing the count comfortably above 31.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: Erbil International Airport (EBL) is a major hub in Iraqi Kurdistan with strong summer traffic. Historically, its network in peak season sits around the low- to mid-30s unique airport destinations when counting domestic, regional, and Turkish resort/city routes. July 1 falls in the heart of the summer schedule, which tends to maximize listed destinations on flightsfrom.com.\n- Threshold analysis: The bar (>31) is plausible but not trivial. Likely contributors include: two Istanbul airports, multiple other Turkish cities (including resorts), several Gulf hubs (DXB/SHJ/AUH/DOH/KWI/BAH/MCT), domestic Iraqi cities (BGW/NJF/BSR, possibly more), some Iran routes (IKA/MHD/etc.), the Levant/Egypt (AMM/BEY/CAI/HBE), and one or a few European links (e.g., VIE). This ensemble commonly reaches or exceeds 31 in summer.\n- Time factor: Only ~5.5 weeks remain. Most summer schedules are already loaded; large network swings are unlikely. The Shafaq article’s “promising season” framing is weak evidence but directionally supportive.\n- Risks pulling it below 32: flightsfrom.com may omit some charter/irregular services; certain geopolitical or security events could prompt temporary suspensions (e.g., Iran-related tensions, post-Hajj adjustments in Saudi routes, lingering BEY uncertainties). If several of these coincide, the count could dip to 28–31.\n- Why not higher: Material uncertainty about which seasonal/charter routes flightsfrom.com counts by July 1, and about the status of some Iran/Levant/Saudi links. A few missing pieces could drop the total just under the threshold.\n- Why not lower: The base network (Turkey + Gulf + Baghdad/Najaf/Basra) likely already approaches the high-20s to low-30s, and July typically adds Turkish resorts and other seasonal links. It doesn’t take many additions to exceed 31.\n- What would raise my estimate: Current verification on flightsfrom.com already showing ≥33 destinations; confirmed additions of Turkish resort routes and resumed services (e.g., BEY, extra Iran cities, or stable AUH/VIE); news of expanded summer operations by FlyErbil/Iraqi Airways/MEA/Austrian.\n- What would lower it: Reports of route suspensions (Iran/BEY/Saudi), significant security disruptions impacting EBL, or evidence that flightsfrom.com excludes multiple seasonal/charter routes this year.\n- Research assistant info: None provided beyond the prompt link; thus the forecast leans on structural patterns and seasonal expectations, with conservative weighting toward the status quo.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 31 direct flight destinations from Erbil, Iraq on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nShafaq News: [Kurdistan Summer 2025: A Promising Season](https://shafaq.com/en/Kurdistan/Kurdistan-Summer-2025-A-Promising-Season)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 31 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Erbil (EBL)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/EBL) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
