    "review": "All three forecasters converge on remarkably similar reasoning and forecasts (65-72% range). We all emphasize the same key factors: the May 8 data showing Sánchez's 3-point lead (35% vs 32%), the short one-month timeframe favoring status quo, and the principle that approval ratings change slowly absent major shocks. Forecaster 3 raises a particularly valid point I had underweighted: approval ratings in the low 30s may be more volatile than higher or lower levels, as both leaders lack strong public support bases. This suggests slightly more downside risk than I initially assessed. Forecaster 2's analysis is nearly identical to mine but arrives at 70% rather than 72%. The tight clustering of our independent forecasts (65-72%) and shared reasoning increases my confidence that this range is appropriate, though it also suggests I may be at the slightly optimistic end. No forecaster identified evidence I had missed or raised fundamentally different considerations - we're all working from the same data and applying similar forecasting principles.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I maintain that the status quo strongly favors YES: Sánchez holds a clear 3-point lead with only 33 days remaining. However, Forecaster 3's observation about volatility at lower approval levels (both in low 30s) is compelling - neither leader commands strong public support, making their ratings potentially more susceptible to shifts. The narrow 3-point margin remains the primary risk factor. My original 72% may have been marginally optimistic given this volatility consideration. The convergence of three independent forecasts in the 65-72% range using similar reasoning validates the analytical framework but suggests I should moderate slightly toward the group consensus. Adjusting to 70% better accounts for the volatility risk while maintaining appropriate weight on the status quo advantage and short timeframe. This puts me aligned with Forecaster 2's nearly identical analysis.",
