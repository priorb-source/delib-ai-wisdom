    "review": "The three analyses show strong consensus on the core reasoning: short 2-month timeframe, status quo bias dominates, Level 4 requires extreme situations, and Niger likely sits at Level 3 currently. All forecasts cluster tightly at 18-25%, suggesting well-calibrated reasoning. Forecaster 2 helpfully enumerates specific conditions that would trigger Level 4 (direct attacks on Americans, complete governmental collapse, widespread conflict), while Forecaster 3 emphasizes that State Department changes occur in response to 'significant events or sustained deterioration' - not routine adjustments. This latter point is particularly important: in just 2 months, there's limited time even for sustained deterioration to manifest and be recognized. None of us have concrete information about Niger's current advisory level, which remains a key uncertainty. The consensus analysis reinforces that absent a major catalyzing event (terrorist attack on Westerners, complete security breakdown, etc.), the baseline expectation is no change. The narrow forecast range indicates we're all weighing similar factors similarly.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I find the consensus reasoning compelling and don't see major gaps in the collective analysis. The 18-25% range appropriately captures the tension between genuine security risks and the powerful status quo effect over short timeframes. My initial 18% may have been slightly too anchored on the status quo. Forecaster 3's emphasis on 'sustained deterioration' being required - not just isolated incidents - reinforces how high the bar is for Level 4 upgrades, especially in just 60 days. However, the clustering of forecasts around 20-25% suggests I may have underweighted the tail risk of a catalyzing event. Niger does face real terrorism threats, and unexpected attacks on Western interests, while not the modal outcome, are certainly possible. The July 2023 coup context and strained Western relations create conditions where a major incident could trigger rapid policy response. I'm updating slightly upward to 20% to reflect the deliberation consensus while maintaining my view that status quo is the most likely outcome.",
