    "review": "The other forecasters and I share a strong consensus on the core analytical tension: balancing a high recent base rate of successful coups, primarily in Africa's Sahel region, against the very short two-month timeframe. We all correctly identify the Sahel as the primary driver of risk. Forecaster 2 introduced a crucial piece of evidence I had not explicitly weighed: recently *foiled* coup attempts. This is a compelling, double-edged point—it confirms that coup plotting is actively occurring, but also that incumbent regimes are on high alert and their counter-coup measures are sometimes effective. Forecaster 3's analysis was very similar to my own, but they helpfully specified a plausible, albeit low-probability, scenario in Latin America with the potential for a self-coup in Venezuela, which adds a specific pathway to a 'Yes' resolution that I had overlooked.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 30% was at the high end of our group's 25-30% range. After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am making a slight downward revision. The most persuasive new argument came from Forecaster 2 regarding the recently foiled coups in Burkina Faso and Chad. My initial rationale focused on the high number of successful coups creating a 'contagion' effect, which I still believe is a major factor. However, the successful thwarting of recent plots suggests that regional governments have adapted and improved their security postures. This increases the chance that a future attempt will also fail. This evidence provides a strong counterpoint to the high base rate of successes seen from 2020-2023 and suggests a reversion toward a lower success rate for any given attempt. While Forecaster 3's point about Venezuela adds a small amount of risk in Latin America, the evidence of effective counter-coups in the much higher-risk Sahel region is more impactful to the overall forecast. Therefore, I am adjusting my forecast down slightly from 30% to 28% to better account for the observed effectiveness of state security measures in preventing coups, while still reflecting the high overall instability in the key regions.",
