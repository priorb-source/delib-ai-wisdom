  "information": "The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is established by federal statute, specifically Section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act (codified at 20 U.S.C. §1087e(m)). Consequently, terminating the program is generally understood to require a new act of Congress. Unilateral executive action to end the program is considered to have uncertain legal standing and would require, at a minimum, a formal notice-of-proposed-rulemaking process, including a public comment period, before any changes could be finalized.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks (48 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The objective remains marked as 'in progress' or some other status besides 'complete' when checked on or after July 1, 2025, resulting in a No resolution",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program continues to operate through July 1, 2025. No legislative action passes Congress to terminate it, and any attempted executive actions remain incomplete or tied up in legal challenges and rulemaking procedures. The tracker maintains its 'in progress' status because no definitive termination has occurred.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Congress rapidly passes legislation terminating PSLF in the next 6 weeks and the President signs it, OR the administration announces aggressive executive action that the tracker maintainers deem sufficient to mark the objective as 'complete' even if full implementation is pending, OR the tracker uses looser criteria for completion based on announced policy changes rather than full legal termination.",
    "rationale": "The key constraint here is the extremely short timeframe of 6.5 weeks combined with significant legal and procedural barriers. My research assistant notes that PSLF is established by federal statute (20 U.S.C. §1087e(m)), meaning termination generally requires Congressional action. Legislation typically takes months to pass, involving committee review, floor debate, and potential Senate procedures. Even if fast-tracked, passing substantive legislation in under 7 weeks would be extraordinarily rushed. Executive action alternatives face similar timing problems: the required notice-and-comment rulemaking process typically takes 3-6 months minimum, well beyond our July 1 deadline. The fact that the tracker currently marks this as 'in progress' suggests they require substantive completion, not just announcements. However, I'm not assigning this near-zero probability because: (1) the tracker's completion criteria may be more flexible than full statutory termination, (2) they might mark it complete based on significant executive orders or policy announcements even if legally contested, and (3) while unlikely, emergency legislative action in a unified government is technically possible. I'm not going higher because the procedural and legal barriers are substantial, the timeframe is very short, and the status quo strongly favors programs continuing unless actively terminated through proper channels. I would update upward if legislation was introduced and fast-tracked in the next 1-2 weeks, or if reporting suggested the tracker uses looser completion standards. I would update downward if we reach early June with no legislative movement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is established by federal statute, specifically Section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act (codified at 20 U.S.C. §1087e(m)).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
