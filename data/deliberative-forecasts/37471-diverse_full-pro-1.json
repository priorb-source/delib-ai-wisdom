    "review": "My initial analysis, which yielded a 20% probability, was strongly aligned with Forecaster 2's reasoning (18%). We both identified the significant pullback in new construction (falling starts and permits) as the primary factor capping inventory growth, and we both acknowledged the historical rarity of the 550k+ level. Forecaster 3 (7%) made a compelling and crucial point that I had not sufficiently weighted: new home sales remain relatively resilient, up 6% year-over-year. This is a critical piece of the puzzle. While I viewed the potential for a sales slump as the main upside risk for inventory, Forecaster 3 correctly frames current sales resilience as an *additional* headwind against inventory accumulation. If builders are producing less and buyers are still absorbing the existing supply at a decent rate, it makes the required surge in inventory even less likely. Forecaster 2's simple extrapolation of the recent +3k monthly trend to a projected 509k also provides a strong quantitative anchor for the 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 20% to 12%. The reasoning from my fellow forecasters has convinced me that my initial estimate was too high. My original forecast was based heavily on the supply-side constraint; builders are clearly reducing future inventory by cutting starts and permits. However, Forecaster 3's argument regarding the resilience of new home sales (+6% YoY) adds a second powerful argument against a rapid inventory spike. The combination of builders deliberately throttling new supply and buyers continuing to absorb existing supply makes the required monthly inventory increase of over 23,000 units for both April and May—an eight-fold acceleration from the recent trend—seem extremely improbable. The market would need to experience a sudden and severe demand shock in the next two months to overcome these dual headwinds. I am not lowering my forecast to Forecaster 3's 7% because I believe it slightly underweights the fragility of the market. With mortgage rates climbing to 6.83%, a sudden stall in sales remains a salient tail risk that could cause inventory to jump unexpectedly in a single month, even if a sustained surge remains unlikely.",
