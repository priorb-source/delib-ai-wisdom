    "review": "Forecaster 2’s reasoning aligns closely with mine and adds useful emphasis on the entrenched interests and the presidential vacuum/caretaker governance as binding constraints—both strengthen the No case within a one-month window. Forecaster 3 places notable weight on the finance minister’s optimistic signaling; I don’t find that persuasive absent corroborating IMF signals (e.g., staff statements on completed prior actions or imminent Board dates). Ministerial confidence has been repeatedly voiced without follow-through. Given the requirement that the agreement involve IMF money (i.e., Board-approved or equivalent), a mere staff-level step wouldn’t suffice. A 30% estimate seems to overstate the likelihood given the process frictions and lack of visible preconditions.",
    "rationale": "Time is very short and there is no evidence of completed prior actions, parliamentary movement on core reforms, or IMF communication pointing to a near-term Board calendar slot. Lebanon’s caretaker setup and presidential vacuum, plus regional security strains, further reduce the probability of assembling and approving a money-bearing arrangement quickly. An emergency path (e.g., RFI) is theoretically possible but would still require a credible policy package and rapid IMF processing—signs we haven’t seen. Forecaster 2’s points reinforce my initial view; Forecaster 3’s optimism rests on weak signaling. Net, I maintain a low probability.",
