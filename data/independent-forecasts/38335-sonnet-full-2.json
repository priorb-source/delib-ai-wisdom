  "information": "As of early June 2025, the Republican primary field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race includes Congressman Byron Donalds, who launched his campaign with an endorsement from former President Donald Trump. On the Democratic side, former U.S. Representative David Jolly, a former Republican and critic of Donald Trump, announced his candidacy on June 5, 2025. Governor Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited, has not endorsed a successor in the Republican primary.\n\nWhen asked about her potential 2026 gubernatorial candidacy, Casey DeSantis has consistently responded with noncommittal phrases such as, \"We'll see.\" As of early June 2025, there have been no public reports of official campaign staff hires, fundraising filings with the Florida Division of Elections, or other formal preparations for a campaign launch. Polling from early 2025 indicated a high favorability rating for her among registered Republicans, with one poll showing her at 57% compared to Byron Donalds' 27%. However, a separate internal poll conducted by the Donalds campaign showed him with a narrow lead over DeSantis, 34% to 30%.\n\nCasey DeSantis is facing public scrutiny related to a House probe into the Hope Florida foundation, an initiative she launched. The investigation was reported by multiple news outlets in late May and early June 2025. The next major campaign finance deadline is June 30, which marks the end of the second fundraising quarter. Historically, major candidates for Florida governor typically announce their campaigns between 8 and 18 months prior to the primary election, which is scheduled for August 2026.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement - Casey DeSantis has not declared candidacy and continues to be noncommittal",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis continues to delay her decision amid the House probe into Hope Florida foundation and Byron Donalds' Trump-backed momentum. She either waits until later in 2025 to announce (still within the historical 8-18 month window before the August 2026 primary) or decides not to run at all given the headwinds.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis accelerates her timeline and announces her candidacy before the June 30 fundraising deadline to capture Q2 donations and counter Byron Donalds' early momentum. She may calculate that waiting longer only helps Donalds consolidate support, or she receives encouragement from major donors or her husband to enter the race sooner.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors no announcement within the next 26 days. Key evidence: (1) Casey DeSantis has shown no visible campaign preparation - no staff hires, no fundraising filings, only noncommittal 'We'll see' responses; (2) She faces significant headwinds including the House probe into Hope Florida and Byron Donalds securing Trump's endorsement, which is crucial in GOP primaries; (3) The timeframe is very short at just 26 days. However, the probability is not negligible because: (1) The June 30 fundraising deadline provides a natural catalyst for announcement timing; (2) She remains within the historical announcement window (8-18 months before the August 2026 primary); (3) Political announcements can happen quickly without extensive visible preparation; (4) One poll showed her with strong favorability (57% vs 27% for Donalds), suggesting potential viability despite recent headwinds. The forecast is not higher because there are simply no indicators of imminent announcement and the probe creates negative pressure. It's not lower because 26 days allows for a surprise entry, particularly around the fundraising deadline. I would update upward if reports emerge of campaign infrastructure being built or if the probe is dismissed. I would update downward if she makes more definitive statements about waiting or if the probe intensifies.",
