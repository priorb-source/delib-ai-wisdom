    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 53 days from today (May 9, 2025) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - GoPro continues operations without filing for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GoPro maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations through June 2025. The company continues normal operations, files required SEC documents, manages cashflow through operational adjustments or secured credit facilities, and addresses any financial challenges through means other than bankruptcy protection.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GoPro faces an immediate liquidity crisis in the next 53 days - perhaps from unexpected covenant violations, credit line withdrawal, or inability to meet imminent debt obligations. The company exhausts all alternatives and files a Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition with a U.S. bankruptcy court before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The extremely short time horizon of 53 days strongly favors the status quo outcome. GoPro has filed its Q4 2024 and full year 2024 results with the SEC, indicating the company is maintaining regulatory compliance and continuing operations as a going concern. Bankruptcy filings by publicly-traded companies are relatively rare events that typically occur after prolonged financial distress, failed restructuring attempts, and clear warning signs. The base rate for any public company filing bankruptcy in a given 2-month window is very low, likely well under 1%. While GoPro has faced well-documented financial challenges over the years (declining revenue, competitive pressures, profitability issues), the company has historically managed to avoid bankruptcy through cost-cutting, operational adjustments, and financing arrangements. For a bankruptcy filing to occur within 53 days, there would need to be an acute, imminent liquidity crisis that emerges suddenly - such as a major creditor refusing to extend credit, an unexpected covenant default with no cure period, or a catastrophic operational failure. The research assistant provided no additional information suggesting such an imminent crisis. My forecast is not higher because bankruptcy in the next 53 days would require circumstances that don't appear to be present based on their recent SEC filing activity. My forecast is not lower because GoPro's financial challenges are real, and there remains some tail risk of unforeseen developments. To revise upward, I would need evidence of: immediate liquidity problems, credit facility revocation, going concern warnings from auditors, or public statements indicating distress. To revise downward, I would need evidence of: strong Q4 results, debt refinancing, new capital raises, or improved operational metrics.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill GoPro file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[GoPro Announces Fourth Quarter and 2024 Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000150043525000003/gpro2024-12x31exh991xer.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if GoPro, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
