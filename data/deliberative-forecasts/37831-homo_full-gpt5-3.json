    "review": "Both forecasters’ reasoning closely matches my baseline. They convincingly emphasize: (1) the short timeline (~5–6 weeks) for any legal or political reversal; (2) weak and slow domestic judicial avenues with uncertain compliance; (3) limited external leverage given Mali’s withdrawal from ECOWAS and alternative security partnerships; and (4) regime incentives to avoid re‑mobilizing opposition before a new framework is imposed. They also correctly note that a qualifying reversal must generally allow new party formation, which raises the bar. The notion of a face‑saving temporary reinstatement that still meets the criterion is a valuable scenario to keep in mind. I don’t see materially new information that shifts my prior, but their framing reinforces the low-probability baseline.",
    "rationale": "My core view stands: the junta is consolidating, the CNT’s 130–2 repeal signals institutional alignment, and the stated plan to draft a new framework suggests intent to control timing and content of any future party system. Courts are unlikely to move fast and secure compliance before July 1. External pressure (UN, AU) lacks immediate bite, and Bamako has shown willingness to absorb reputational costs while relying on alternative partners. Reinstating parties broadly now would risk opposition coordination, which the arrests and prior suspensions indicate the regime aims to prevent. The time left is short for a reversal that meets the resolution’s threshold (general allowance for party formation). Non‑zero paths persist—a Supreme Court action the regime accepts, AU‑brokered incentives, or sudden mass protests/elite splits prompting a tactical rescind—but these are low-probability within the window. Given the close alignment with peers and no new disconfirming evidence, I keep my estimate unchanged.",
