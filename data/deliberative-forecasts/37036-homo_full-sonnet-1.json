    "review": "All three of us independently arrived at 30%, which suggests strong convergence on the evidence. The analyses are remarkably consistent on key points: (1) the exploratory committee was formed only 2-3 weeks ago, (2) Osborn explicitly said 'early summer' which naturally means June/July, (3) historical patterns from his 2024 race and typical exploratory committee durations point to June-July 2025, and (4) 38 days provides theoretical time but base rates suggest otherwise. Forecaster 3 introduced a useful distinction about meteorological vs astronomical summer - if 'early summer' refers to meteorological summer (June 1 start), then 'early summer' would be June, not May, which actually strengthens the No case. The arguments about Trump's endorsement potentially accelerating the timeline are reasonable but somewhat speculative. No fundamentally new information was introduced that I hadn't considered, and the convergence at 30% across independent analyses suggests this is well-calibrated.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' reasoning, I find their analyses thorough and compelling, reinforcing my original assessment. The evidence remains strongly weighted toward No: Osborn formed his exploratory committee only about 3 weeks ago, explicitly stated he will decide 'by early summer' (which conventionally means June/July, after the June 1 cutoff), and his 2024 campaign pattern suggests a June-July 2025 announcement. The typical 3-6 month exploratory period would place an announcement in June-September. The 30% probability appropriately accounts for uncertainty around whether political pressures could accelerate his timeline, whether late May could be considered 'early summer,' or whether he might announce exactly on June 1. However, the preponderance of evidence - his recent statements, the timing of his exploratory committee formation, and historical patterns - points to a June/July announcement window. The independent convergence at 30% across all three forecasters suggests this is a well-reasoned probability that balances the strong base rate evidence against remaining uncertainty. I see no compelling reason to adjust my forecast.",
