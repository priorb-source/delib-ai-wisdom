  "information": "A key topic of discussion related to the G7 summit is the potential for new sanctions against Russia. US Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal have advocated for a new package of sanctions to be coordinated with European allies before the summit. However, according to news reports citing EU diplomats, it is unlikely that the European Union will have a new sanctions package ready by mid-June. President Zelenskyy has publicly called for increased pressure on Russia and for joint sanctions to be agreed upon at the G7 level.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The G7 summit is scheduled for June 2025, and today's date is June 3, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "President Zelenskyy attends the G7 summit in person. This follows the precedent set in 2023 and 2024, where he attended in person to lobby for continued international support for Ukraine.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, major escalation in the war, such as a large-scale Russian offensive, requires President Zelenskyy's presence in Kyiv. Alternatively, a specific and credible security threat against his travel or the summit itself forces him to cancel his in-person attendance, possibly opting for a virtual address instead.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The military situation in Ukraine remains relatively stable, and security arrangements are deemed sufficient. President Zelenskyy travels to Kananaskis, Canada, to personally press G7 leaders for increased military aid, financial support, and further sanctions against Russia, reinforcing Ukraine's strategic alliances.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong precedent and high strategic value of President Zelenskyy's in-person attendance. He has attended the last two G7 summits (2023 in Japan, 2024 in Italy) in person, establishing a clear pattern of behavior. The G7 is a critical forum for Ukraine to secure diplomatic, military, and financial support. The research provided indicates that a key topic is new sanctions against Russia. The fact that the EU may not have a package ready while the US is pushing for one makes Zelenskyy's personal lobbying efforts even more crucial to bridge gaps and create a unified G7 front. This context significantly increases the incentive for him to be there in person. \n\nThe probability is not higher than 85% primarily due to the inherent volatility of leading a country at war. Two main risks prevent a more certain forecast: a sudden military crisis requiring his command in Ukraine, and a specific, high-level security threat to his person. These are non-trivial risks. \n\nThe probability is not lower because the diplomatic and strategic importance of attendance is immense. Missing the summit would be a significant missed opportunity to directly influence policy and secure vital aid. Zelenskyy has demonstrated a consistent willingness to accept travel risks for key diplomatic engagements. \n\nI would increase my forecast if the week of the summit arrives with no reports of major battlefield escalations or specific security threats. I would decrease it significantly upon credible reports of either of those scenarios unfolding.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Volodymyr Zelenskyy attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCalgary Herald: [Prime Minister Carney invites Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to G7 summit in Kananaskis](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/pm-mark-carney-invites-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-g7-summit-kananaskis)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA key topic of discussion related to the G7 summit is the potential for new sanctions against Russia.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
