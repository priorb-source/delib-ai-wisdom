  "information": "The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) receives approximately 5,000-6,000 total UFO reports annually. The 'Pilot' report subtype constitutes about 1% of these, amounting to 30-60 reports worldwide per year. Non-US pilot reports are less frequent, with about 3-5 recorded annually from outside the United States. Reports from South American countries average around 1-2 per year. Specific examples of recent pilot reports from the continent logged in the NUFORC database include a sighting in Brazil in December 2024 and one from a Chilean Air Force crew in February 2023. The NUFORC system is based in the United States and uses an English-language reporting form.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one and a half months, as the event window is June 2025 and the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Given the historical frequency of such reports, the most likely outcome is that no qualifying report will be filed for the specific month of June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The month of June 2025 concludes without any pilot flying over a South American country filing a UFO/UAP report with The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) that meets the resolution criteria. This could be due to a lack of notable sightings, or pilots choosing other reporting channels, or not reporting at all.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial, military, or private pilot encounters an anomalous object while flying over a South American nation (e.g., Brazil, Chile) in June 2025. The pilot is aware of the NUFORC platform and submits a detailed report, which is subsequently published on the NUFORC website and categorized as a 'Pilot report'.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the historical frequency, or base rate, of qualifying reports. The research indicates that NUFORC logs approximately 1-2 pilot reports from South America per year. This establishes that while such reports are rare, they are not impossible; the mechanism for a 'Yes' outcome exists, as evidenced by past reports from Brazil and Chile. Distributing this annual average (1.5 reports/year) across 12 months suggests a rough monthly probability of about 12.5%. However, I am adjusting this downward to 8%. My reasoning is that these are discrete, random events, and the US-centric, English-language nature of the NUFORC platform acts as a significant filter, likely depressing the number of reports from primarily Spanish and Portuguese-speaking regions. The status quo is that these reports are infrequent. My probability is not higher because there is no specific information to suggest June 2025 will be an anomalous month for sightings or reporting. A forecast of 20% or more would imply an expectation of a report every 5 months, which is inconsistent with the data. My probability is not lower (e.g., 1-2%) because that would understate the established base rate of 1-2 reports *per year*. The fact that they happen annually means a single month has a non-trivial chance. I would increase my forecast if there were credible news of a UAP 'flap' or increased activity over South America. I would decrease it if a major South American aviation authority launched a new, prominent, local reporting system, which would likely divert reports away from NUFORC.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in South America in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) a sighting in Brazil in December 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the South American continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) receives approximately 5,000-6,000 total UFO reports annually. The 'Pilot' report subtype constitutes about 1% of these, amounting to 30-60 reports worldwide per year.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
