    "review": "My initial forecast was anchored on the qualitative assessment that the specified event is extremely rare, leading to a low probability. Forecaster 2 correctly introduced a key mechanism I had overlooked: international pilots flying into South America may be more likely to report to the US-based NUFORC, mitigating some of the regional/language barriers. However, their 24% forecast seems too high given the historical data. Forecaster 3 provided the most compelling analysis by introducing a quantitative framework. Their estimation of a base rate of 1-2 such reports per year and the subsequent application of a Poisson distribution to derive a monthly probability is a much more rigorous and defensible methodology than my initial approach.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast upward from 5% to 12%. My initial forecast was too low because it was based on an unquantified intuition of the event's rarity. The other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 3, convinced me that a more structured, data-driven approach is necessary.\n\nThe core of my updated reasoning is adopting Forecaster 3's quantitative model. The estimate of 1-2 South American pilot reports being posted to NUFORC annually appears to be a reasonable reflection of the historical data. This annual frequency translates to a monthly average rate (lambda) of approximately 0.125 events. Using a Poisson distribution, the probability of at least one such event occurring in a given month (in this case, June 2025) is P(X≥1) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - e^(-0.125), which calculates to approximately 11.8%. This provides a solid quantitative anchor for the forecast.\n\nForecaster 2's argument about international pilots provides a crucial qualitative support for this number, explaining *why* we might see reports on a US-centric site from South America, thus bolstering the plausibility of the 1-2 annual report base rate. The combination of a sound statistical model grounded in a reasonable base rate and a plausible reporting mechanism makes a 12% forecast far more robust than my initial 5%.",
