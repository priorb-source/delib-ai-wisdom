    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days (from May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Claude 4 has not been released to the general public",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic either does not release Claude 4 by July 1, 2025, or releases it initially with a waitlist/early access period that extends beyond the deadline, meaning general public access is not achieved before July 1",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic announces and releases Claude 4 to the general public without waitlist restrictions sometime in the next 46 days, allowing immediate access via API or website",
    "rationale": "With only 46 days remaining until the deadline and no information suggesting an imminent Claude 4 release, the status quo heavily favors a No outcome. Major AI model releases typically involve substantial preparation including marketing buildups, technical infrastructure scaling, and often staged rollouts with early access periods lasting weeks or months before general availability. Claude 3 was released in March 2024, making it about 14 months old by now - while this is within the typical cadence for major model updates, the complete absence of announcements, teasers, or credible leaks in my research assistant's report is concerning. Tech companies, especially in the competitive AI space, usually signal major releases weeks or months in advance. A surprise launch within 46 days, while not impossible, would be unusual. The forecast is not lower (not 5%) because: (1) 14 months is a reasonable gap between major versions, (2) surprise launches do occasionally occur, and (3) Anthropic could have maintained unusually tight secrecy. The forecast is not higher (not 40%+) because: (1) the extremely short timeframe makes coordinated launch activities difficult, (2) zero signals of preparation contradict typical release patterns, and (3) status quo bias should be strong. I would update higher if credible leaks, official teasers, or infrastructure changes appeared. I would update lower as June progresses without announcements.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
