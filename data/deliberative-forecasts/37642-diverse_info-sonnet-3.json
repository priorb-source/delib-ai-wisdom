    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable new evidence I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 3's specific citation of major bank forecasts is particularly compelling: Goldman Sachs now sees the first cut in December 2025, Bank of America moved from June to July, and Morgan Stanley also sees July. The Bloomberg economist survey shifting its modal forecast from May to July is strong consensus evidence. Forecaster 2's point about Fed Chair Powell explicitly stating he's 'not in a hurry to cut' and the Fed's upward revision of inflation forecasts to 2.7% in March 2025 further strengthens the case against a near-term cut. These are more concrete data points than the general market sentiment I initially referenced. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the rarity of intermeeting cuts and the clustering of professional forecasts at July or later is persuasive. However, I note that even with this bearish evidence, there remains one full FOMC meeting (June 10-11) and several key data releases (April/May PCE, May payrolls, possibly May CPI) before the deadline. The forecasts of 12% and 25% bracket my original 20%, suggesting I was in a reasonable range, though the specific professional forecaster consensus evidence suggests I should lean slightly lower.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' evidence, particularly the specific bank forecasts and Bloomberg survey consensus pointing to July or later, I believe a modest downward revision is warranted. The Goldman Sachs December 2025 forecast, combined with BofA and Morgan Stanley both seeing July, provides stronger evidence than I initially weighted. Powell's explicit statement about not being 'in a hurry' and the Fed's upward inflation revision to 2.7% reinforce the patience stance. However, I'm not moving as low as 12% because: (1) there is still one full FOMC meeting with ample time for data to surprise dovish, (2) tail risks of economic or financial shocks exist, and (3) the Fed has surprised markets before. My updated forecast of 15% reflects the strong professional consensus against a June cut while maintaining probability for unexpected developments in the roughly 3.5 weeks before the June meeting and potential data surprises that could shift Fed calculus.",
