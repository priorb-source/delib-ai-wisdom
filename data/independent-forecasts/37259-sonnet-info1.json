  "information": "Following the March 2025 Greenlandic parliamentary elections, the Demokraatit party, which advocates for a gradual path to independence, emerged as the winner. The new Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, favors incremental autonomy and has emphasized economic development. While the more staunchly pro-independence Naleraq party doubled its number of parliamentary seats, it remains in the opposition. The government has initiated some formal steps, including the presentation of a draft constitution in May 2023 and the formation of a commission under the Self-Government Act to handle independence negotiations; this commission has been given a multi-year mandate.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - The status quo strongly points toward no announcement by July 1, 2025, given the gradualist approach of the current government",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Demokraatit-led government continues its stated policy of gradual, incremental progress toward independence. Prime Minister Nielsen focuses on economic development and building institutional capacity rather than rushing to schedule a referendum. The multi-year commission mandate proceeds at its intended pace, with no urgency to announce a referendum date in the next two months. The government views referendum timing as something to address years from now, not weeks from now.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Unexpected external pressure - potentially from Trump administration statements or changing Danish-Greenlandic relations - creates political urgency. Alternatively, internal political dynamics shift as the opposition Naleraq party successfully pressures the government to accelerate independence timelines. The government decides to announce a referendum date (potentially scheduled for years in the future) as a symbolic political move to consolidate support and respond to heightened international attention on Greenland's status.",
    "rationale": "The status quo outcome strongly favors No. The winning Demokraatit party explicitly campaigned on a 'gradual path to independence' and the new PM emphasizes 'incremental autonomy' and 'economic development' - language that signals patience, not urgency. Most tellingly, the research assistant notes the independence commission has a 'multi-year mandate,' which clearly indicates a timeline measured in years, not months. With only 2 months remaining until the resolution date, this temporal mismatch is highly significant. The more pro-independence Naleraq party did double its seats, which shows growing sentiment, but crucially they remain in opposition without governing power. Even if they pushed for faster action, they lack the authority to schedule a referendum. The question has a relatively low bar - merely announcing a date (which could be years away) rather than holding the actual referendum - but even this would require significant political will and preparation that appears absent. The commission formation and 2023 constitutional draft show long-term groundwork, but not imminent action. Why not lower than 12%: There's always some possibility of unexpected developments given heightened international attention from Trump's statements. Political dynamics can shift quickly, and announcing a future date is technically easier than holding the referendum itself. Small possibility of symbolic political announcement. Why not higher: The government's explicit gradualism, multi-year commission timeline, only 2 months remaining, and lack of any signals suggesting imminent referendum planning all point strongly against this outcome.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing the March 2025 Greenlandic parliamentary elections, the Demokraatit party, which advocates for a gradual path to independence, emerged as the winner.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
