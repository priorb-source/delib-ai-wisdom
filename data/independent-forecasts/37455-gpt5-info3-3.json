  "information": "Starlink's parent company, SpaceX, has a regional partnership with Airtel Africa to provide high-speed internet services to its customers across the continent. Geographically, Lesotho is a landlocked country, entirely surrounded by South Africa, where Starlink is not yet licensed to operate. The country has a small area of approximately 30,355 km² and is characterized by mountainous terrain.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the license, SpaceX delays flipping Lesotho to “Available” due to logistics (device import/transit through South Africa), final regulatory/type-approval steps, lack of a local distribution partner, or low commercial priority for a small market. The availability map remains Coming Soon/Planned past June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "SpaceX finalizes compliance and distribution (possibly via an authorized reseller) and updates the map in late May or June to show Lesotho as Available, enabling orders/activations even if shipments are initially limited.",
    "rationale": "- Recap and base rates: Starlink often takes weeks to a few months after licensing to mark a country as Available. With ~7–8 weeks left, this is feasible but not assured. Many African launches since 2023 suggest faster cycles are possible once licensing is done, but not guaranteed. \n- New information: Lesotho reportedly granted a Starlink license on Apr 14, 2025. That removes the major regulatory blocker. However, Lesotho is landlocked inside South Africa, where Starlink is not licensed. Hardware for Lesotho likely must transit South Africa, creating a realistic logistical/regulatory choke point even if service can technically work via inter-satellite links and foreign gateways. The Airtel Africa partnership is regionally relevant but Airtel does not operate in Lesotho, so it may not materially accelerate this specific case. \n- Status quo weighting: The default is that small markets take longer unless prioritized; map changes typically happen only when SpaceX is ready to accept orders/ship or activate via partners. That points modestly toward No given the short window and transit uncertainties. \n- Why not higher: (1) Enclave logistics risk through South Africa could slow shipments and onboarding; (2) Small market may be lower priority; (3) Some prior African markets saw months between license and map availability. \n- Why not lower: (1) License is already granted—biggest hurdle cleared; (2) Technical readiness likely high (regional coverage exists; ISL can backhaul); (3) SpaceX has been accelerating African rollouts and could batch-update availability before quarter-end; (4) They can list as Available with an authorized reseller model if direct shipping is awkward. \n- What would move me up: Official Starlink or Lesotho regulator signals of imminent launch (e.g., type approvals published, announced authorized distributors, pricing posted for Lesotho), evidence of successful import routes, or neighboring enclaved Eswatini being available (showing SA transit is surmountable). \n- What would move me down: Reports of SA customs blocking Starlink terminal transit to Lesotho, silence from SpaceX while other newly licensed countries remain pending, or the Starlink map updating Lesotho to a vague “Planned” later date beyond mid-2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Lesotho as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lesotho grants license to Musk's Starlink](https://www.ewn.co.za/2025/04/14/lesotho-grants-license-to-musks-starlink)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Lesotho listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nStarlink's parent company, SpaceX, has a regional partnership with Airtel Africa to provide high-speed internet services to its customers across the continent. Geographically, Lesotho is a landlocked country, entirely surrounded by South Africa, where Starlink is not yet licensed to operate. The country has a small area of approximately 30,355 km² and is characterized by mountainous terrain.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
