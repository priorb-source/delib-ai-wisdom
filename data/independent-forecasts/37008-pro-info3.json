  "information": "As of April 21, 2025, the Samoan government had not announced any plans to extend the state of emergency. The National Emergency Operation Centre's update on April 15 confirmed that emergency orders were valid until April 29. The crisis has had a significant economic impact, estimated at a 16% hit to the country's GDP.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Samoan government allows the current state of emergency, related to the power crisis, to expire as scheduled on April 29, 2025. With the power situation sufficiently stabilized, no extension is deemed necessary, and no other crisis emerges to trigger a new declaration.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Repairs to the damaged power generators prove more complex or time-consuming than anticipated, forcing the Samoan government to formally extend the state of emergency beyond April 29, 2025, to continue managing the crisis.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the official timeline of the current state of emergency. The declaration made on March 31, 2025, is explicitly scheduled to end on April 29, 2025, one day before the resolution date of this question. This makes 'No' the clear status quo outcome. My research assistant's report corroborates this, noting that as of April 21, the government has not announced any plans for an extension. Generally, governments prefer not to prolong states of emergency due to their disruptive nature and economic costs, which in this case are estimated to be a significant 16% of GDP.\n\nHowever, I am assigning a 25% probability to a 'Yes' outcome, which is a significant non-zero chance. This is because the root cause of the emergency is a severe infrastructure failure. Such large-scale repairs are often subject to unforeseen delays and complications. If the power situation has not substantively improved or worsens as the deadline approaches, the government will be under immense pressure to extend the emergency declaration to maintain control and manage resources effectively.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 25% because I am weighting the official, scheduled end date as the strongest piece of evidence. The absence of communication regarding an extension, with only about a week to go, is a strong signal that the current intention is to let it expire. My forecast is not lower because the severity of the crisis and the inherent unpredictability of major infrastructure repair work make an extension a plausible and realistic contingency for the Samoan government.\n\nI would increase my probability forecast upon any official statements or credible reports suggesting repair work is behind schedule or that the power crisis is not abating. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if the government or the electric utility provides positive updates on repair progress and explicitly reaffirms its intention to lift the state of emergency on April 29.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count. (Note that when it was declared, it was scheduled to be in effect through April 29, 2025.)\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of April 21, 2025, the Samoan government had not announced any plans to extend the state of emergency. The National Emergency Operation Centre's update on April 15 confirmed that emergency orders were valid until April 29. The crisis has had a significant economic impact, estimated at a 16% hit to the country's GDP.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
