    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Currently, no North American country has an active yellow fever travel advisory on the CDC's Travel Health Notices page.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The rising cases of yellow fever mentioned by PAHO remain geographically contained within the usual endemic zones of South America. Any isolated cases imported into North American countries do not lead to sustained local transmission, and therefore, the CDC does not issue a specific travel health notice by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An outbreak in a South American country bordering Central America leads to multiple imported cases in a nation like Panama or Costa Rica. These cases spark a localized, human-to-human transmission cycle via mosquitoes. The outbreak is detected and publicly reported, prompting the CDC to issue at least a Level 1 Travel Health Notice for the affected country as a precaution for US travelers.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored in the strong status quo. North American countries, including Central America and the Caribbean, do not typically experience yellow fever outbreaks that warrant CDC travel advisories. The public health infrastructure and vector control programs in most of this region are generally sufficient to prevent the establishment of sustained transmission from imported cases. The timeframe of just over one month is also very short for an outbreak to emerge in a new area, be detected, and trigger an official CDC notice. The primary evidence for a 'Yes' outcome is the PAHO epidemiological alert, which indicates heightened regional activity. This increases the probability of imported cases into North America. However, the alert does not specify which countries are seeing rising cases, and it is most likely concentrated in known endemic areas in South America. My probability is not lower than 5% because the PAHO alert is a significant piece of information that elevates the baseline risk. A small, but confirmed, cluster of local transmission in a country like Panama is plausible and could be sufficient to trigger a precautionary CDC notice. My probability is not higher because this would require a chain of low-probability events: an infected traveler arriving in a receptive area, a competent mosquito vector biting them during the viremic period, that mosquito surviving and biting a susceptible person, and this cycle repeating enough to form a detectable cluster, all within a few weeks. I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of confirmed local yellow fever transmission in any Central American or Caribbean nation. I would decrease it if PAHO reported that the South American outbreaks were contained.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country in North America is listed as having a travel advisory by the Centers for Disease Control at its [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices) page when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
