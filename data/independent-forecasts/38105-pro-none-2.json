    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with a deadline of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No agreement will be announced. Lebanon's political factions will continue to be deadlocked, failing to implement the key economic and financial reforms required by the IMF as prior actions to unlock a funding package.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Lebanon's parliament and government fail to pass the necessary legislation for financial sector restructuring, a revised banking secrecy law, and a capital controls framework that meets IMF standards. Disagreements among the political elite and vested interests in the banking sector continue to obstruct progress, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without a final agreement being signed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under extreme pressure from a rapidly deteriorating economic situation and international partners, Lebanon's key political stakeholders reach a last-minute consensus on a package of reforms. They swiftly pass the minimum required legislation, allowing the IMF board to approve a deal just before the deadline. The announcement is made as a desperate measure to prevent a total state collapse.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the persistent status quo of political and legislative paralysis in Lebanon. A staff-level agreement (SLA) with the IMF has been in place since April 2022, but for over three years, Lebanon's political leadership has failed to implement the 'prior actions' necessary to finalize the deal and release funds. These reforms—including financial sector restructuring, unifying the exchange rate, and passing a capital controls law—are politically fraught as they require allocating trillions of liras in losses, which directly threatens the interests of the entrenched political and banking elite. With only one month remaining until the deadline, the time is extremely short to overcome years of deep-seated gridlock and pass such complex, controversial legislation. The research assistant's report of 'no additional information' reinforces that there are no new catalysts suggesting a break from this long-term pattern. My probability is not lower than 12% because the dire economic situation creates constant pressure, and a sudden shock could theoretically force a desperate, last-minute compromise. The IMF and international community also have an interest in preventing a complete failed state, and might show some flexibility if a minimally viable reform package is presented. My probability is not higher because there is no tangible evidence to suggest the fundamental political blockages have been resolved. A 'Yes' outcome would require an unprecedented display of political will that has been absent throughout this crisis. I would increase my forecast upon seeing credible reports of key reform laws being passed by parliament or a public consensus on loss distribution among major political blocs. I would decrease it if key politicians make statements reinforcing their opposition to the required reforms.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the IMF and Lebanon announce an agreement before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lebanon finance minister confident of a new deal with IMF to help crumbling economy](https://www.newarab.com/news/lebanon-finance-minister-confident-new-deal-imf)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Lebanon and the International Monetary Fund announce any economic agreement between the two entities signed after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025. In order to count, it must involve the IMF agreeing to provide money to Lebanon, whether through loans, grants, or any other means.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
