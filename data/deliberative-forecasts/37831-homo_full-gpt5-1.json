    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my baseline: short timeline, strong regime incentives to maintain the ban, weak courts, and limited external leverage post-ECOWAS. Useful additions: (1) emphasis on bureaucratic/legislative inertia making an interim framework before July unlikely; (2) the possibility that a face‑saving rescission paired with de facto constraints could still meet resolution criteria; (3) mention that pressure from specific actors (e.g., Algeria, Russia) could matter if it materializes. None of these shift me meaningfully—Russia is unlikely to press for party reinstatement, Algeria’s priority is security, not rapid political liberalization, and there’s no sign yet of a fast‑track legal/administrative turnaround or mass mobilization forcing a climb‑down.",
    "rationale": "~40 days remain. The junta’s behavior (CNT repeal, arrests, prior suspensions of political activity) and stated intent to ‘rationalize’ the landscape point to maintaining control while drafting a new framework on its own schedule. Domestic courts may hear challenges, but rapid annulment plus visible compliance before July is a stretch. International condemnation lacks bite; Mali has shown willingness to absorb reputational costs and has alternative partnerships. A qualifying “Yes” would most plausibly come from: a Supreme Court administrative suspension/annulment that the junta decides to honor immediately; or a tactical, face‑saving reinstatement pending a new law. There are no current signals of either. Given the very short window and consistent authoritarian consolidation, I keep a small tail for a tactical concession but see the base case as the ban persisting past July 1. No material new evidence from peers justifies moving off my prior.",
