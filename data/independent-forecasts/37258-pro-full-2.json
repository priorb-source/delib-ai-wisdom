  "information": "A 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling established that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a legally binding independence referendum without the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster. The UK government has consistently denied requests for another referendum, a position reiterated by the UK Labour party. The previous independence referendum in 2014 was announced approximately two years before it was held, and precedent suggests constitutional changes require around 18 months of legal and administrative lead time.\n\nIn January 2025, Scotland's First Minister John Swinney described independence as an 'urgent priority'. However, former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stated in the same month that a referendum was 'off the radar' for now and unlikely before the 2030s. More recent government announcements in April 2025 indicate a strategic focus on the economy, child poverty, and public services. The Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, has stated his party will not support an independence referendum during the next Holyrood term, regardless of the 2026 election outcome. The leader of the Alba Party, Kenny MacAskill, has suggested using the May 2026 Holyrood elections as a direct mandate for negotiating independence rather than holding a separate referendum.\n\nThe Scottish Government has issued guidance advising against significant or high-profile government announcements between May 15 and June 5, 2025, due to a by-election campaign in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency. Separately, tens of thousands of Scottish council workers are being balloted on strike action, with the vote closing on June 12. Public opinion polls on independence are mixed; while one poll showed an 11-point lead for 'Yes,' other sources from late April 2025 indicate polling remains in the 45-55% range against independence, with one citing 54% opposition.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (resolves July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Scottish government will not announce a date for an independence referendum within the specified timeframe, as its focus remains on domestic policy and the upcoming 2026 Holyrood elections.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish government continues to prioritize economic issues, child poverty, and public services through May and June 2025. Facing significant legal barriers from the UK Supreme Court ruling and consistent opposition from the UK government, and with the 2026 Scottish Parliament election emerging as the next logical step to seek a mandate, no official announcement of a referendum date is made before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, major political crisis unfolds, such as a severe conflict over powers between Holyrood and Westminster, coupled with a dramatic and sustained surge in polling for independence. In response, the First Minister makes a high-stakes, unilateral announcement of a referendum date in late June to galvanize the independence movement and politically challenge the UK government, despite the lack of a clear legal path.",
    "rationale": "The probability of the Scottish government announcing a referendum date before July 1, 2025 is extremely low. My forecast is primarily driven by the convergence of four key factors: the short timeframe, established legal and political blockades, the government's stated priorities, and the electoral calendar.\n\nFirst, the deadline is less than two months away. Constitutional announcements of this magnitude typically involve months, if not years, of political and administrative preparation, as seen with the 2014 referendum. The current window is further compressed by a ban on major government announcements until June 5 due to a by-election, leaving only a few weeks for such a pivotal declaration.\n\nSecond, the legal and political landscape is prohibitive. The 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling prevents the Scottish Parliament from legislating for a referendum unilaterally. While the question resolution depends only on the announcement itself, making such an announcement without a viable path to a legally-recognized vote would be a highly risky and likely symbolic gesture. Both major UK parties remain opposed to granting the necessary powers.\n\nThird, the Scottish government's recent focus is on domestic policy. April 2025 announcements prioritized the economy and public services. While independence remains a long-term goal, as stated by First Minister John Swinney, immediate government activity does not suggest an imminent referendum announcement. This is reinforced by former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's recent statement that a referendum is 'off the radar' for now.\n\nFinally, the political cycle points towards the May 2026 Holyrood elections as the next focal point for the independence debate, with some pro-independence figures suggesting it be used as a de-facto mandate for negotiations.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 2% because politics can be unpredictable; a 'black swan' event, such as a major constitutional crisis or a sudden, massive shift in public opinion, could force the government's hand. It is not higher because the combined weight of the short timeline, legal hurdles, stated government priorities, and the looming 2026 election makes the status quo overwhelmingly likely to hold. I would increase my forecast if senior Scottish Government figures began explicitly signalling an imminent announcement or if multiple polls showed a sudden, massive and sustained shift to over 60% support for independence. Conversely, as we progress through June without any such signals, my probability would move closer to zero.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling established that the Scottish Parliament cannot unilaterally hold a legally binding independence referendum without the approval of the UK Parliament in Westminster.
