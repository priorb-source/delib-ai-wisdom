    "review": "Both forecasters convincingly stress the exact-phrase constraint and NYT style tendencies. Forecaster 2 adds a useful point that NYT often avoids state-media coinages unless explicitly quoting, and that even if the China trend is covered, “reverse shopping/consumption” is likelier than “reverse purchasing.” Forecaster 3 emphasizes the historical preference for “repurchase/buyback” and “reverse repurchase” in finance, making “reverse purchase” especially rare. Neither dwells on the Russia angle (Putin’s decree on “reverse purchase” of assets), which remains a plausible but weak path via a direct quote. Overall, their arguments slightly lower my estimate.",
    "rationale": "Key constraints remain: a narrow June 10–30 window; the NYT search requires the exact strings; and NYT style likely favors established alternatives (“buyback,” “repurchase,” “reverse shopping/consumption”). The China coinage could appear if quoted in a Li Yuan/business feature, and any newsletter mention would satisfy resolution, but that still seems unlikely. The Russia pathway (coverage of a June development that quotes “reverse purchase” verbatim) provides some upside but is speculative; more likely NYT uses “buy back” or “repurchase” language. Given peers’ points about editorial style and translation choices, I’m trimming my estimate slightly while keeping a small premium over their numbers for the Russia-quote possibility.",
