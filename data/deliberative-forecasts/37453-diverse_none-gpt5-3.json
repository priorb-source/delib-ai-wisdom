    "review": "Both forecasters make arguments consistent with my prior view and add two helpful emphases: (1) the very short lead time compared with historic referendums (Quebec 1980/1995) and (2) the polling reality that independence remains a minority position, making an announcement politically risky. They also reinforce the point that the UCP’s strategy centers on autonomy within Canada rather than separation. I find their reasoning convincing and see no countervailing signals or catalysts I had missed.",
    "rationale": "With only ~55 days left, no visible legislative or administrative groundwork, and no credible media signals, the prior remains very low. The political calculus for Premier Smith still favors leverage and autonomy measures over a separation vote, particularly with business and moderate caucus incentives aligned against a sudden referendum announcement. The question would resolve Yes even if the vote were scheduled far in the future, which keeps a small tail risk alive, especially if a sudden Ottawa–Alberta confrontation emerged. However, the added weight on base rates, historical lead times, and polling strengthens the case to shade down. I am reducing my forecast from 3% to 2% to reflect the extremely low likelihood absent a major, acute catalyst in the next few weeks.",
