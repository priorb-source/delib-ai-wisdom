  "information": "In April 2025, China conducted the \"Strait Thunder-2025A\" military exercises, which involved dozens of aircraft and warships. According to a spokesperson for the Chinese Eastern Theater Command, the operation aimed to test China's capabilities in \"controlling zones\" and \"blockading\" Taiwan, and included simulations of \"strikes on key ports and energy infrastructure.\" Following these and other drills, US military officials, including US Pacific Army Commander Ronald P. Clark and US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Admiral Samuel Paparo, stated that China's exercises simulating a blockade of Taiwan have become a \"regular occurrence\" and that Beijing is rehearsing the \"full spectrum of military operations.\"\n\nIn response to China's military exercises around Taiwan, the US has used terms such as \"intimidation tactics,\" \"provocative,\" \"coercive military activities,\" and \"aggressive military activities.\" In April 2025, the US Department of State accused China of \"putting regional security at risk\" with its drills. To date, US government statements have not officially characterized China's actions as a \"blockade.\" Historically, even during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the US did not formally accuse China of a blockade. Diplomatic talks between the US and China were held in Shanghai in April 2025.\n\nAccording to US military leaders, the upcoming 2025 National Defense Strategy (NDS) will prioritize \"preventing a Chinese attack on Taiwan\" as the sole major assumption scenario. This represents a strategic shift to focus on the Indo-Pacific region. At the same time, US Admiral Samuel Paparo has warned that China is rapidly increasing its production of warships and submarines relative to the US, stating a production ratio of 6 to 1.8 for warships and 2 to 1.4 for submarines. Paparo stated that while the US would prevail in a conflict now, its military forces are on a \"bad trajectory.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the US does not accuse China of blockading Taiwan",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China continues military exercises around Taiwan that simulate blockades, but no actual blockade occurs. The US maintains its current diplomatic approach, using terms like 'provocative' and 'coercive' to describe Chinese activities without formally accusing China of implementing a blockade. Diplomatic channels remain open and both sides manage tensions without major escalation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "China significantly escalates by either implementing an actual blockade of Taiwan's seaports (preventing commercial vessels from entering or leaving), or conducts operations so aggressive that the US feels compelled to formally characterize them as a blockade. This could occur as part of a broader crisis triggered by a specific incident, leading the US to abandon its historical reluctance to use blockade terminology.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Key evidence: (1) Despite China's April 2025 'Strait Thunder-2025A' exercises explicitly simulating blockades, the US has not characterized them as actual blockades; (2) Historical precedent is powerful - even during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the US did not formally accuse China of a blockade; (3) Current US rhetoric uses terms like 'intimidation tactics' and 'provocative' but stops short of blockade accusations; (4) Diplomatic engagement continues (Shanghai talks in April 2025). The question requires a very specific outcome: a public US accusation of an actual blockade of Taiwan's seaports. This would require either a genuine Chinese blockade (extremely escalatory and unlikely in 8 weeks) or a dramatic shift in US diplomatic language that breaks historical patterns. While tensions are elevated and China is openly rehearsing blockade scenarios, exercises simulating blockades are different from actual blockades. The short timeframe (56 days) somewhat increases probability since dramatic events could occur quickly, but the base rate of such major escalations is low. Good forecasting requires placing heavy weight on the status quo - the world typically changes slowly, and diplomatic norms are sticky. I'd update higher if China takes concrete blockading actions, US rhetoric becomes more inflammatory, or a major crisis erupts. I'd update lower if diplomatic engagement deepens or tensions de-escalate. My forecast balances the real tensions and military preparations against the strong historical pattern of US diplomatic restraint and the low base rate of such major escalations occurring in short timeframes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of blockading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWSJ via MSN: [China Is Ready to Blockade Taiwan. Here’s How.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/china-is-ready-to-blockade-taiwan-here-s-how/ar-AA1BvnW8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of blockading at least one of Taiwan's seaports without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn April 2025, China conducted the \"Strait Thunder-2025A\" military exercises, which involved dozens of aircraft and warships.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
