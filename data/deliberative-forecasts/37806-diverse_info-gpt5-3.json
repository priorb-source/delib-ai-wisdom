    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds two useful points I underweighted: (1) the May 3 DV-2026 results passed without signaling, which modestly lowers the chance of a near-term action keyed to the lottery cycle; and (2) despite a very active pace of presidential actions, none have touched DV over ~5 months, reinforcing the status-quo pull toward No. I agree with their emphasis on the exact-phrase requirement as a meaningful hurdle, though I think State/WH materials sometimes do use “Diversity Visa,” so it’s not prohibitive.\n\nForecaster 3’s 30% feels high. The notion of a pre-baked early-action list is less persuasive this late into the term; if DV was an early priority, we likely would have seen it already. The trigger-event scenario (a high-profile crime by a DV selectee) is possible but rare and unpredictable in a six-week window. I agree a legislative push (e.g., SAFE for America Act) is a more durable route, which makes an EO mention less likely.\n\nNet: I find F2’s reasoning largely aligned with mine and more compelling than F3’s higher estimate. I’ll nudge slightly upward from my prior forecast due to the administration’s high tempo on immigration and the fact that one qualifying mention in a broader EO is plausible, while still keeping the probability well below 1-in-5.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~42 days. Status quo: No qualifying presidential action to date; DV program operating normally; administration focused on border/enforcement and headline actions. A No outcome occurs if the White House continues prioritizing border/asylum/parole and any immigration EOs avoid the DV topic or use alternate phrasing (“Diversity Immigrant Visa”). A Yes outcome occurs if the White House issues a broad immigration EO or proclamation that includes talking points to “end the Diversity Visa (lottery)” and the text uses the exact phrase “Diversity Visa,” and it is posted to the presidential actions page before July 1.\n\nKey considerations:\n- Constraints: The DV program is statutory; an EO can’t end it, lowering the incentive to spend scarce bandwidth, and increasing reliance on legislation. The exact-phrase requirement is a real but not decisive hurdle.\n- Track record and timing: ~5 months without mention is strong evidence against; with ~6 weeks left, the hazard rate is low. Also, the DV-2026 results have already been released, reducing a natural hook.\n- Reasons for non-zero: Trump’s longstanding opposition to the lottery, a highly active immigration agenda, and the possibility of a messaging EO referencing DV as part of a merit-based framework. One document could satisfy the criterion if it explicitly says “Diversity Visa.”\n\nGiven these, I make a small upward adjustment from my prior 14% to reflect the administration’s prolific action pace, but stay below 20% due to statutory limits, lack of signals, and the narrowing window.",
