    "review": "Both other forecasters came to the exact same conclusion as I did, with a 1% probability. Their reasoning is logically identical to my own, relying on the same definitive evidence: multiple credible news outlets have confirmed that Johnny Walker has withdrawn from the UFC 316 bout due to injury, and a replacement fighter, Brendson Ribeiro, has been officially scheduled to fight Azamat Murzakanov instead. They correctly point out that the resolution criteria are unambiguous, stating that if Walker does not fight Murzakanov, the question resolves as 'No'. They also share my rationale for not setting the forecast at absolute zero, allowing for a minuscule, theoretical possibility of a bizarre, last-minute reversal. I find their reasoning entirely convincing as it mirrors my own thought process and is based on solid, undisputed facts. No new arguments or evidence were raised, and the consensus simply strengthens my confidence in my initial assessment.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 1%. The deliberation with the other forecasters has produced a strong consensus, with all three of us arriving at the same probability based on the same set of facts and reasoning. The core of this forecast remains the official and widely reported withdrawal of Johnny Walker from the fight due to injury. This has been confirmed by multiple reputable MMA news sources, and the UFC has moved on by officially booking a replacement opponent, Brendson Ribeiro, to face Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316. The resolution criteria for this question are explicit: if the Walker vs. Murzakanov fight does not happen, the question resolves as 'No'. The current state of affairs directly meets this condition. The other forecasters did not present any information that would challenge this conclusion. Therefore, there is no reason to change my forecast. The 1% probability remains as a hedge against an extremely improbable series of events where the replacement fighter withdraws and a miraculously healed Walker is re-booked for the fight, which is a standard precaution against forecasting with absolute certainty.",
