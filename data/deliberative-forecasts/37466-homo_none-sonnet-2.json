    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I underweighted. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that 54 days is technically plenty of time for a simple label change on a website - this isn't a complex redesign, it's updating text. Both forecasters also note the article title already includes '(Gulf of America)' as evidence of awareness and some receptiveness, which I mentioned but perhaps undervalued. However, Forecaster 2 helpfully distinguishes that the article page and North America map page may be maintained differently, which cuts against simply extrapolating from the article title. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the conservatism of geographic reference websites and international rejection of the rename aligns with my original reasoning. The key tension is between technical feasibility (easy and quick to change) versus institutional conservatism (reference sites favor stability and international consensus). I was probably too pessimistic given: (1) the technical ease of making the change, (2) the article title showing active tracking of the issue, and (3) WorldAtlas being a commercial U.S. site not bound by international standards. However, I maintain skepticism because four months have passed without the critical map page changing, suggesting the article acknowledgment may be the extent of their accommodation.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating moderately upward from 15% to 23%. The key factors that warrant this increase are: (1) Technical feasibility - Forecaster 2 correctly notes that website label changes are simple and 54 days is ample time; (2) The article title evidence shows WorldAtlas is actively tracking this issue and hasn't completely ignored it; (3) As a U.S. commercial website, WorldAtlas has more latitude to make editorial decisions than international geographic bodies. However, I'm not moving as high as Forecaster 2's 35% because: (1) Four months have elapsed since the executive order with no change to the critical North America map page, suggesting significant inertia; (2) Geographic reference websites historically exhibit strong conservatism regarding political name changes; (3) The article page accommodation might represent their full response rather than a precursor to map changes; (4) Lack of international recognition creates reputational risks for a reference website. The resolution allowing both names together slightly increases the probability, but the extended period without action on the target page is telling. 23% balances technical feasibility against institutional conservatism and observed behavior.",
