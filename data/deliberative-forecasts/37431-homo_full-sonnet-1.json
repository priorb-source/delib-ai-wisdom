    "review": "All three forecasters converged on 40-45%, suggesting strong agreement on the core factors. The other forecasters raised important points I had underweighted: (1) Forecaster 3's framing that we need to be in the faster 50% of recalls with only 2 days of cushion below the 70-day median is particularly sharp; (2) Both emphasized the frozen product verification challenge more strongly - frozen items can remain in consumer freezers indefinitely, making FSIS verification of complete removal from commerce genuinely difficult; (3) Forecaster 2's specific mention of the 17-month production window (November 2023 to April 2025) highlights an extreme complication I had noted but underweighted. The status quo bias argument is also stronger than I initially applied - after 11 days with no indication of progress, expecting closure in the remaining 57 days requires being well ahead of schedule. However, I still find value in the geographic limitation (NY only) and allergen classification arguments. The data contradiction between 45-day mean and 70-day median likely reflects different sample sets rather than statistical anomaly.",
    "rationale": "Reviewing the evidence more critically: The 68-day total window requires this recall to close faster than 50% of comparable cases, with minimal margin. The frozen product nature creates a structural impediment - FSIS cannot easily verify complete removal when products sit in consumer freezers for months. The 17-month production window genuinely complicates lot tracking and verification beyond typical recalls. While I maintain that limited geographic scope and allergen (vs pathogen) classification provide meaningful advantages, these may not be sufficient to overcome the frozen product verification challenge within 68 days. The convergence of forecasts at 40-45% reflects appropriate uncertainty given contradictory signals in the data. I'm revising down from 45% to 43% - acknowledging the frozen product and extended production window challenges warrant more weight, while still recognizing the genuine advantages from geographic limitation and recall classification that prevent going as low as 40%.",
