    "review": "Both forecasters largely agree with my initial logic. The main incremental points they surfaced were: (1) the 3+ week lag since the Apr 14 license without any public Starlink signal, which slightly weakens the “imminent flip” precedent from DRC; (2) the practical distinction that the resolution requires “Available,” not “Coming Soon/Waitlist”; and (3) added emphasis on operational steps (type approval, payments, distribution) and the enclaved South Africa risk possibly slowing activation. No new concrete facts, but these sharpen downside risks and prioritization concerns. I find this reasoning moderately persuasive, especially the elapsed‑time signal and the outcome’s strict “Available” requirement.",
    "rationale": "Core view unchanged: a national license plus Starlink’s recent Africa cadence makes a pre‑July map flip plausible. Starlink has demonstrated the ability to move from license to availability quickly (e.g., DRC), and laser backhaul/geofencing lowers technical barriers in Lesotho. However, the absence of any visible progress three weeks post‑license, Lesotho’s small market, and the sensitivity of enabling an enclave within unlicensed South Africa increase the chance that operational or compliance steps (type approval, payments/tax setup, shipping/fulfillment) push the flip beyond July 1. Given these considerations, I’m trimming my estimate slightly to reflect the time‑since‑license signal and the stricter resolution criterion. I’m moving from 68% to 64%.",
