    "review": "Both forecasters add useful color I hadn’t explicitly weighed: (1) concrete vote-delivery endorsements for Cuomo in Orthodox Jewish communities and targeted Hispanic outreach (incl. PR Parade timing), and (2) meaningful counter-risks: AOC’s endorsement of Mamdani, possible progressive consolidation under RCV, and potential backlash to Cuomo’s independent “Fight and Deliver” line and landlord-aligned spending. I find the turnout-bloc argument for Cuomo persuasive in a low-turnout primary, but I also find the RCV ceiling risk and momentum narrative credible. Their probability ranges (56–62%) feel a bit low relative to consistent late-May polling showing Cuomo near 40% and a Marist RCV sim giving him a path to 50%+, yet they appropriately temper confidence given tightening polls and polarization.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~2 weeks to primary day. Status quo: Cuomo leads in multiple late-May polls (high 30s to low 40s) with Mamdani in high teens/low 20s; a Marist RCV simulation had Cuomo clearing 50% by round five. What moves me down from my prior 74%: the credible risks emphasized by others—RCV dynamics if progressives consolidate behind Mamdani, Cuomo’s potential second-choice weakness among progressives, and possible backlash to his independent line and landlord-aligned spending. AOC’s endorsement could further consolidate and mobilize the left. What keeps the probability clearly above 50%: persistent multi-poll lead, resource advantage, and endorsements tied to turnout-reliable blocs (Orthodox communities) plus targeted Hispanic outreach—factors that often matter most in NYC primaries. Net: I trim my estimate to reflect tightening and RCV uncertainty but still see Cuomo as a clear favorite absent a late shock or evidence of dramatic progressive consolidation in new polling/RCV simulations.",
