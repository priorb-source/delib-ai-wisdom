  "information": "Historical changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are infrequent. In February 2024, Intel and Walgreens were replaced. In August 2020, Exxon Mobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies were replaced by Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell. In June 2018, General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, and in March 2015, AT&T was replaced by Apple.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 66 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — all current components remain in the DJIA with no removal announcement by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No major corporate actions or sector-balance issues arise and the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee makes no announcement; the index composition stays unchanged through June 30, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The index committee announces a swap, e.g., removing an underperforming or troubled constituent (such as Boeing or 3M) to rebalance sector representation or react to a major corporate event (split, merger, crisis), even if the effective date is later than July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon and base rate: With roughly two months left, the base rate for DJIA changes is low. Over the last decade, removals have been infrequent (events in 2015, 2018, 2020, 2024). Your assistant notes changes in 2015 (AT&T→Apple), 2018 (GE→Walgreens), 2020 (three removals), and 2024 (two removals, including Intel being replaced by NVIDIA and Walgreens by Amazon). That’s about 7 removals across ~10 years, implying a modest annual hazard. Over ~0.18 of a year, a rough base-rate translates to a low single-digit to low-teens chance.\n- Status quo weight: The DJIA committee typically avoids frequent tinkering; changes cluster around clear catalysts (major M&A, spin-offs, bankruptcies, severe sector misrepresentation, or stock splits that distort a price-weighted index). No such imminent, well-telegraphed catalyst is evident right now for these 30 names.\n- Potential catalysts (keeping probability above zero):\n  • Boeing’s ongoing operational/regulatory challenges could, in an extreme deterioration scenario, prompt reconsideration, but the committee has historically tolerated prolonged turbulence (e.g., past Boeing crises) without immediate removal.\n  • 3M’s restructuring/spin-off has already occurred; additional near-term action seems unlikely before July 1.\n  • Large stock splits or surprise mega-deals among constituents (e.g., mergers affecting index sector balance) could provoke a swap, but none are publicly signaled as imminent.\n- Why not higher: Short window; very recent reshuffle in Feb 2024 reduces near-term need; lack of concrete, time-bound catalysts.\n- Why not lower: The committee can act without warning; unexpected crises, M&A, or split-induced rebalancing can trigger an announcement at any time. Only an announcement is required for this to resolve Yes (effective date can be later), so tail risk remains.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting/leaks about index changes; a major constituent announcing a transformative split/merger; a sudden severe crisis (e.g., trading halt, massive downgrade, or regulatory action) that undermines sector representation; an announced large split of a high-priced name that materially distorts weights.\n- What would move me down: Time decay without news through June; stabilization of high-watch names (e.g., Boeing) and absence of large corporate actions; explicit committee guidance indicating no near-term changes (rare).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are infrequent. In February 2024, Intel and Walgreens were replaced. In August 2020, Exxon Mobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies were replaced by Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell. In June 2018, General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, and in March 2015, AT&T was replaced by Apple.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
