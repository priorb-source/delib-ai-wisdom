    "review": "Forecaster 2 correctly highlights strong preparatory signals (top-tier banks, IPO-experienced leadership) and that a Q2 S-1 would fit an H2 listing. However, they seem to conflate “IPO in 2025” with “announcement before July 1,” which is a tighter constraint. They underweight that companies often use confidential submissions (if eligible) and wait to go public with an S-1 until closer to launch, making a pre–July 1 public filing less likely. Forecaster 3 emphasizes the narrow resolution triggers, the short runway (39 days), lack of movement since March, and market volatility—all directly relevant. I find Forecaster 3’s framing more consistent with the resolution mechanics and timeline risk. Forecaster 2’s argument adds plausibility to a 2025 IPO but doesn’t strongly increase the probability of a pre–July 1 public S-1 or a company blog announcement.",
    "rationale": "Two qualifying events count: 1) a public S-1, or 2) a specific announcement on Discord’s news/blog. A company blog pre-announcement is uncommon; most issuers let the S-1 speak for itself. If Discord qualifies as an EGC, it can submit confidentially and delay a public S-1 until closer to launch, reducing the odds of a by–July 1 disclosure. Even without EGC status, the timing still argues caution: with ~5.5 weeks left, a June S-1 is plausible if aiming for an early-August debut, but many 2025 H2 IPOs will opt to file in late summer. Market volatility and optionality considerations further lower the incentive to rush a June filing. The March reporting (banks engaged, 2025 target, IPO-experienced leadership) confirms intent but not timing. Given the narrow resolution criteria and short timeline, the base case remains no announcement before July 1. I would move higher on credible reporting of an imminent public S-1 or evidence of a June filing calendar firming; lower if volatility worsens or reporting indicates a delay. Net, I maintain a modest probability with a slight preference to No.",
