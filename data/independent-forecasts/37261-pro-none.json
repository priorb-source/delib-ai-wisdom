    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo is the absence of a protest of this magnitude on any given day. Without a specific, large-scale catalyst, the 10,000-participant threshold will not be met in the short timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The period between May and July 1, 2025, passes without a single, powerful mobilizing event. Supreme Court decisions released in June are not perceived as dramatic enough to trigger mass outrage, and no other major political or social flashpoint emerges that leads to a protest of 10,000 or more people being organized and reported by the tracker.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In late June, the Supreme Court releases a highly controversial decision on a major issue like abortion access, gun control, or election law. In response, civil society groups rapidly organize 'emergency' protests in major US cities, with at least one event drawing over 10,000 participants. This protest is then documented by the Global Protest Tracker with a start date before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 65% is primarily driven by the timing of the question's window, which crucially includes the end of the US Supreme Court's term in late June. This period is consistently a source of highly contentious and polarizing decisions that serve as powerful catalysts for large-scale public mobilization. Given the current political climate following the 2024 election cycle, the propensity for rapid, large-scale protest in response to judicial or political events is high. Recent history, such as the protests following the Dobbs decision, demonstrates that the 10,000-participant threshold can be quickly met and exceeded in major cities when a sufficiently motivating issue arises. The status quo is the absence of such a protest, but this specific two-month window is inherently unstable due to the predictable timing of the Supreme Court's calendar.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the 10,000-participant threshold is still significant, and there is no guarantee that a specific Court decision will provoke a sufficient response within the short timeframe. Additionally, there can be a lag in both protest organization and reporting by the Global Protest Tracker. The world changes slowly, and it's possible this period could pass without such a catalyst.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the likelihood of a contentious Supreme Court ruling is very high, and this is the single most reliable predictor of large-scale, non-electoral protest in the US. The combination of a polarized public and a court that has shown a willingness to make landmark rulings makes a quiet June less probable than an eventful one.\n\nI would increase my forecast if a draft of a particularly controversial Supreme Court opinion were to leak, or if a separate major social or political flashpoint (e.g., a viral incident of police brutality) were to occur in May or June. I would decrease my forecast if the major cases on the Court's docket were resolved in a less polarizing manner than expected.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in the United States with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBrookings Institution: [The power of protest in the US](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-power-of-protest-in-the-us/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in the United States with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
