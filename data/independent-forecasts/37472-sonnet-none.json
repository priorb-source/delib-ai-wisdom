    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "54 days until the end of the resolution period (July 1, 2025), with the actual resolution window being May 12 to July 1 (50 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Sheikh Hasina remains in exile in India",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheikh Hasina continues her exile in India or relocates to another country, making statements from abroad but not physically entering Bangladesh. The political situation in Bangladesh remains unstable or hostile to her return, and no extradition proceedings materialize within the 50-day window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sheikh Hasina either voluntarily returns to Bangladesh after rapid political negotiations with the interim government, or India extradites her to face charges in Bangladesh. Alternatively, she could enter Bangladesh territory for medical reasons, transit, or in response to a dramatic political shift in Dhaka.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a NO outcome. Sheikh Hasina fled Bangladesh in August 2024 amid mass protests and has been in exile in India for approximately 9 months. The resolution window is remarkably short - only 50 days from May 12 to July 1, 2025. While the article indicates she has vowed to return and is making critical statements about the current government, political rhetoric from exile often differs significantly from actual action. Several factors make a return unlikely in this timeframe: (1) Political exiles historically remain away until conditions fundamentally change, which rarely happens in weeks; (2) The interim government under Yunus appears to be in opposition to her, suggesting the political environment hasn't normalized; (3) Legal and personal safety concerns likely persist; (4) If extradition were being considered, such processes typically take many months or years, not weeks; (5) No evidence suggests imminent negotiations or plans for return. The forecast isn't higher because there is genuine uncertainty - unexpected political developments can occur, emergency situations could force her return, or behind-the-scenes negotiations could be happening. The forecast isn't lower because her public statements suggest she's actively considering return, and political situations can shift rapidly in South Asia. I would update significantly upward if credible reports emerged of: active negotiations for her return, India signaling willingness to facilitate her departure, or the Bangladesh government inviting her back. I would update downward if the interim government issued arrest warrants or if India granted her long-term asylum status.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sheikh Hasina return to Bangladesh before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFirstpost: [Bangladesh has turned into a ‘terrorist country’: Sheikh Hasina targets Yunus, vows to return](https://www.firstpost.com/world/bangladesh-has-turned-into-a-terrorist-country-sheikh-hasina-targets-yunus-vows-to-return-13878191.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sheikh Hasina after May 12, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of Bangladesh according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nThe circumstances of her entering Bangladeshi territory, whether voluntarily or due to her extradition from India, will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
