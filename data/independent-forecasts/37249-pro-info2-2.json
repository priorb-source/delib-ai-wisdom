  "information": "On May 1, 2025, local elections are scheduled to take place in England, representing the first major electoral test since the Labour party's landslide victory in the July 2024 general election. Voters will elect over 1,600 councillors and mayors across 23 local authorities. In conjunction with these elections, a UK parliamentary by-election is being held in Runcorn and Helsby. Opinion polls for the by-election in early April indicated a lead for Reform UK, with 28% support, putting them 6 points ahead of Labour (22%) and 8 points ahead of the Conservatives (20%). It was also reported that up to 60 council candidates had defected from the Conservative party to run for Reform UK in the May elections.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Two months, until June 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Labour party, having won a landslide general election less than a year ago, will remain the highest polling party. Reform UK will not achieve a 4-point polling lead over all other parties.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK's post-election momentum stalls. While they may poll ahead of the Conservatives and perform well in the May 1st local elections, they fail to close the significant gap with the governing Labour party. The political landscape stabilizes with Labour in first place, and Reform does not reach the numbers required to secure a 4-point lead in the Politico poll of polls.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Fueled by a surprisingly strong performance in the May 1st local elections and by-election, Reform UK's polling numbers surge as the Conservative vote completely collapses. Simultaneously, the Labour government is hit by an early, damaging scandal or a significant economic crisis, causing their support to fall sharply. This perfect storm lifts Reform UK past a weakened Labour party to the top of the poll of polls with a lead of 4 points or more.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high degree of political inertia in the UK, balanced against the clear and present momentum of Reform UK. The status quo, which I weight heavily, is that a party with a new, large parliamentary majority like Labour will command a lead in the polls. For Reform UK to not only overtake Labour but to establish a 4-point lead in a polling average within two months would require a political realignment of unprecedented speed.\n\nThe information from my research assistant is critical and is the primary reason the probability is not lower. The polling lead in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election and the defection of Conservative councillors indicate that Reform UK is successfully capitalizing on the Conservative Party's post-election collapse. The May 1st local elections are a major catalyst that could accelerate this trend, creating a media narrative and a voter bandwagon effect.\n\nHowever, the question's criteria set a very high bar. Reform's gains come primarily from the Conservatives. To achieve a 4-point lead, they would also need the governing Labour party's support to fall significantly. A new government is often afforded a 'honeymoon period,' and while not guaranteed, a collapse of the scale required for this outcome is unlikely in such a short timeframe. The Politico poll of polls also smooths out individual poll volatility, meaning a sustained, cross-pollster trend is needed, not just a single outlier.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because of the sheer scale of the polling shift required to overtake a new government. It is not lower because the report indicates Reform's momentum is real and the local elections provide a clear mechanism for a potential political shock.\n\nI would increase my forecast if initial local election results show a near-total wipeout of the Conservative vote with Reform as the primary beneficiary, alongside a sharp, concurrent drop in Labour's approval ratings. I would decrease it if the results show the Conservative vote is more resilient than expected or if Labour's national polling figures remain stable post-elections.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
