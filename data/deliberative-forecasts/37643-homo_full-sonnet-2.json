    "review": "Both forecasters arrived independently at 10%, emphasizing the critical uncertainty about how Keep_Track moderators define 'complete.' This is a valid point I underweighted. They correctly note the distinction between administrative restrictions and actual termination matters significantly for tracker interpretation. However, I believe they may be overstating this uncertainty. The objective specifically uses the word 'terminate'—not 'restrict,' 'limit,' or 'significantly reduce'—which is quite definitive language. The program will still legally exist and be operating on July 1, 2025, just with potentially narrower eligibility. Both forecasters acknowledge the rulemaking timeline is incompatible with completion by July 1, yet assign 10% probability. This seems inconsistent unless they're heavily weighting the tracker interpretation scenario. I find their analyses well-reasoned but believe they overestimate the likelihood that preliminary administrative actions limiting eligibility would be marked as 'completing' the termination objective.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain that the timeline and legal constraints make program termination by July 1 nearly impossible. The rulemaking committee's first session occurs essentially at the deadline, with rules expected 'later in 2025.' Congressional action is required for true termination and cannot occur in 48 days. The key question both forecasters emphasize—how Keep_Track defines 'complete'—is important but they may overweight it. The objective states 'terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program,' not 'restrict eligibility' or 'limit access.' The program will legally exist and continue operating on July 1, albeit potentially with tighter eligibility rules. For tracker maintainers to mark 'terminate' as complete while the program still exists would be a significant interpretive stretch. I'm updating from 4% to 6% to acknowledge greater uncertainty about tracker interpretation than I initially assigned, and to account for both forecasters independently arriving at 10%. However, I believe 10% is too high given: (1) the specific language of 'terminate' versus 'restrict,' (2) the program's continued legal existence, and (3) the complete absence of timeline-compatible mechanisms for actual termination. My 6% reflects small probabilities for unexpected Congressional action (~1%) and loose tracker interpretation (~5%).",
