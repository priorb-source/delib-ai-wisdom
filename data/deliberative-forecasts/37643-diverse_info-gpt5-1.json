    "review": "Forecaster 2 reinforces the core constraints I already leaned on: PSLF’s statutory basis, the tight 47-day window, and the tracker’s likely high bar for “complete.” I agree with their emphasis on process timelines (NPRM, comment periods) making pre–July 1 completion implausible.\n\nForecaster 3 adds a potentially new and salient data point: a scheduled DOE negotiated rulemaking session June 30–July 2 focused on modifications rather than termination. If accurate, that timing nearly rules out any pre–July 1 action that could credibly be labeled “termination,” and it signals intent to narrow/modify, not end the program. I find this argument directionally convincing and tighter on timing than my initial take.\n\nI still don’t go as low as 1% because there’s residual tail risk: a sudden legislative rider in a fast-moving package or the tracker choosing a looser “functionally terminated” interpretation. But overall, their inputs push me down modestly.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Terminating PSLF requires Congress; executive action can narrow but not end the statutory program. The tracker is likely to require clear, implemented termination to mark “complete.” With only ~7 weeks left, a bill passing both chambers and being signed—and then recognized by the tracker—looks very unlikely.\n\nNew consideration: The reported DOE negotiated rulemaking session June 30–July 2 implies the administration is pursuing modification via rulemaking, not termination, and the schedule collides with the July 1 deadline. That both tightens the timeline and signals policy direction inconsistent with termination.\n\nUpside tail remains: An unexpected legislative maneuver (e.g., a last-minute rider in a must-pass vehicle) or an unusually aggressive administrative action that the tracker decides to count could still happen, but both seem remote.\n\nNet: I lower my forecast from 8% to 5% to reflect the added timing and signaling constraints, while retaining a small tail for surprise legislative action or tracker interpretation risk.",
