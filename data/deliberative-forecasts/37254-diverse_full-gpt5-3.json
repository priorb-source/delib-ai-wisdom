    "review": "Both forecasters correctly emphasize the short window, Russian force constraints, NATO deterrence, and the lack of corroborated OSINT for preparations outside Ukraine. I’m skeptical of the asserted US “policy shift” reflected in the UN vote claim; even if accurate, I doubt it materially lowers the probability that the US would level an accusation in the face of a clear invasion. Forecaster 3’s 10% feels high for a two‑month window absent indicators. Forecaster 2’s 5% is closer to my view and sensibly frames Moldova/Transnistria as the main non‑NATO tail risk; however, logistics and access constraints to Transnistria remain severe, and Zapad/West‑2025 is outside our timeframe.",
    "rationale": "Baseline remains a No outcome: Russia is heavily committed in Ukraine; opening a new overt front—especially versus NATO—would be extraordinarily risky. There are no credible signs of imminent large-scale deployments for operations outside Ukraine. Belarus doesn’t count (consent). Georgia/occupied regions present ongoing friction, but a new, indisputable “sending of ground forces” deeper into uncontested Georgian territory seems unlikely without preparatory signals. Moldova/Transnistria is the main tail risk: an incident expanding beyond the existing Russian presence could meet the criterion and would likely elicit a prompt US accusation. Still, Russia’s ability to materially reinforce Transnistria is constrained by geography and Ukrainian control of the airspace. The alleged US UN vote does not change my conditional assessment that, if a clear invasion occurred, the US would accuse. Given peer inputs, I marginally widen the tail to reflect residual uncertainty around opportunistic moves or miscalculation, but the absence of corroborated indicators keeps the probability very low. I’m moving from 3% to 4%.",
