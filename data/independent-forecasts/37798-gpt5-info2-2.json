  "information": "In a recent home series ending May 18, 2025, the Dodgers were swept in three games by the Los Angeles Angels. This was the Dodgers' first three-game sweep at home since June 2023. Prior to this series, the Dodgers had been tied with the Detroit Tigers for the best record in the major leagues. The Angels entered the series in last place in the American League West and were reportedly on pace to post historically poor offensive numbers for the season. Other competitive teams in the National League include the Mets and the Phillies.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 27 days (from 2025-05-19 to 2025-06-15)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — after being swept by the Angels, the Dodgers are no longer holding the best MLB winning percentage.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One of the current leaders (e.g., Tigers, Phillies, Mets) maintains a slim edge while the Dodgers play roughly .550–.600 ball over the next ~25 games, or the Dodgers hit another mini-slump and remain a game or two behind on June 15.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Dodgers post a strong 16–8 or better stretch into mid-June while the current leaders regress toward .600, resulting in LA either overtaking them or tying for the top winning percentage when MLB.com standings are checked on/after June 15.",
    "rationale": "- Current baseline: Per the assistant’s report, LA was tied for MLB’s best record before getting swept at home by the Angels (May 18). That sweep likely dropped them a game or so off the top line. With only ~4 weeks to the check date, the status quo favors No.\n- Time window/volatility: There are ~22–27 games left before June 15 for most teams. Over that span, a 1–2 game swing in the standings is common, so a comeback to the top is very plausible. However, being the single highest team on a specific date is hard because several teams (Tigers, Phillies, Mets, possibly others) are clustered near the top.\n- Team quality: The Dodgers’ underlying talent is elite, which supports a meaningful chance of a hot run and/or rivals cooling. That said, recent injuries and pitcher usage issues (noted in the article) plus the fresh 3-game skid highlight downside risk and near-term variance.\n- Ties: MLB standings display winning percentage; if the Dodgers are tied for the best percentage, that should count as “having the highest winning percentage.” This slightly boosts the chance versus a strict sole-possession requirement.\n- Why not higher: Multiple contenders within a couple of games means the field collectively has a larger chance; LA is not currently on top, and a single-day snapshot increases randomness against any one team.\n- Why not lower: True-talent edge, recent history of sustained winning, and the modest gap make catching up within a month very feasible.\n- What would move me up: Evidence that LA’s gap to first is ≤1 game; return to health for key pitchers; an upcoming soft schedule; rivals facing tougher series or injuries.\n- What would move me down: News of new/extended injuries to Dodgers stars, a tougher-than-average road trip or schedule into mid-June, or confirmation that a rival is 3+ games clear heading into June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the LA Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nYahoo Sports: [Even as Dodgers navigate injuries and manage pitcher usage, the wins keep coming](https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/even-as-dodgers-navigate-injuries-and-manage-pitcher-usage-the-wins-keep-coming-053322413.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Los Angeles Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn a recent home series ending May 18, 2025, the Dodgers were swept in three games by the Los Angeles Angels. This was the Dodgers' first three-game sweep at home since June 2023. Prior to this series, the Dodgers had been tied with the Detroit Tigers for the best record in the major leagues.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
