    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until 00:00 on July 8, 2025, Rio time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new country is invited as a full BRICS member before or at the 17th Summit",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Brazil, as host, keeps enlargement off the actionable agenda; India aligns with a pause; no pre-summit Sherpa consensus emerges and the final communiqué uses only generic language on future expansion with no invitations issued.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Late-June or summit-time consensus elevates one existing partner (e.g., Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Belarus, Thailand, etc.) to full membership, or Brazil corrals agreement to invite a Latin American guest (e.g., Colombia or Uruguay) as a headline deliverable; the invitation is announced in a pre-summit press note or in the leaders’ communiqué.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and signals: The host (Brazil) is publicly signaling caution. Brazil’s top adviser Celso Amorim said in May 2025 BRICS should stabilise before admitting more members. Draft agendas for Rio prioritize financial architecture and development funds and use only non-committal language on further enlargement. As host, Brazil can effectively park expansion absent unanimous enthusiasm. Unanimity is required; India has historically been cautious about rapid expansion, while China and Russia are more pro-expansion. This constellation biases toward no new invitation by July unless there is a clear trade-off or pre-baked deal. \n- Recent trajectory: BRICS has expanded significantly (six invited in 2023; four joined in 2024; Indonesia joined Jan 2025). That recent addition shows further expansion is possible between summits, but also creates integration workload and political incentives for a pause—consistent with Brazil’s messaging. Saudi Arabia still hasn’t formally accepted its 2023 invitation, another reason to avoid adding complexity right now. \n- Host’s guest list: Brazil inviting Mexico, Uruguay, and Colombia as guests suggests interest in Latin American engagement but not necessarily readiness to push immediate membership, given the brevity of the runway and the unanimity constraint. \n- Why not higher: Strong host caution, lack of concrete preparatory language, and tight timeline make a fresh invitation unlikely in the next five weeks. Any one member can veto. \n- Why not lower: The partner-country framework provides a ready pipeline, and Indonesia’s quick elevation in Jan 2025 proves fast moves are feasible. China/Russia may still seek a symbolic win; a single, consensus-friendly partner (e.g., Kazakhstan or Malaysia) could be elevated if late-breaking bargaining succeeds. \n- What would move me up: Credible leaks or Sherpa drafts explicitly naming a candidate for elevation; Brazil softening public stance; synchronized pro-expansion statements from Brazil, India, and South Africa; partner countries publicly signaling they’ve completed accession modalities. \n- What would move me down: Brazil or India explicitly ruling out new invitations at Rio; authoritative reporting that expansion is off the agenda; additional complications with current accessions (e.g., Saudi decision uncertainty) prompting a formal pause.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a new country be invited to BRICS at the 17th BRICS Summit?\n\nQuestion background:\n[BRICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS) is an intergovernmental organization originally founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which held their first formal summit in 2009. South Africa was invited to join in 2010, completing the original five-member grouping. BRICS serves as a forum for cooperation among major emerging economies, with a focus on economic development, political coordination, and reform of international institutions.\n\nAt the [15th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_BRICS_summit) in August 2023, the group announced a major expansion. Full membership invitations were extended to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Argentina later declined the invitation, while Saudi Arabia has not formally accepted. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE officially joined on January 1, 2024.&#x20;\n\nAt the [16th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_BRICS_summit) in October 2024, held in Kazan, Russia, BRICS formally introduced a new partner country framework. Thirteen countries were invited as partners at the 16th Summit: Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed participation. Indonesia later joined as a full member on January 6, 2025.\n\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled to take place on July 6–7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many countries have formally expressed interest in joining BRICS, but new members can only be admitted with unanimous agreement from existing members. While expansion remains a stated goal of the bloc, no new invitations have been confirmed.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if at least one previously not invited country is invited to join BRICS as a full member during or before the 17th BRICS summit.\n\nThis question will only resolve based upon an invitation for full membership, not partner status or any other status in the organisation.\n\n* An invitation of a partner country to become a full member will resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* Reinvitation of Saudi Arabia or Argentina will not be sufficient to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Whether or not a country accepts its invitation will have no impact on this question.\n* If the 17th BRICS summit is delayed, that will not impact this question unless the delay is to after August 31, 2025, in which case this question will be annulled.\n* The specific cutoff for resolution will be 00:00 following the final day of the summit. For example, if the summit is held as expected on July 6-7, the cutoff will be July 8, 00:00. This question will use the timezone of the summit's location, if the summit has no physical location, it will use UTC.\n* For the purposes of this question, \"country\" is defined as a UN member state.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled for July 6-7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
