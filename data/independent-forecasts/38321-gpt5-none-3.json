    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks (late June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — US presidents virtually always attend NATO summits, and the 2025 summit is scheduled for June in The Hague.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump skips the summit and sends a representative (e.g., the Vice President or Secretary of State) due to a domestic crisis, a deliberate political snub, health/security concerns, or a last-minute scheduling conflict; or the summit is postponed/cancelled out of June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump travels to The Hague and participates in leader-level sessions, using the platform to press allies on burden-sharing and alliance priorities, consistent with past presidential practice and his previous in-person attendance at NATO summits.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: NATO leader summits are premier events that US presidents almost always attend. Trump, despite skepticism toward NATO, attended prior summits in person (2017, 2018, 2019) because the diplomatic and political stakes are high and the venue offers leverage for his agenda. The Netherlands is a close ally; security and logistics will be robust. With the summit slated for late June, plans would typically already be in motion, making attendance the status quo path. \n\nWhy not higher: Trump is more willing than recent predecessors to break norms. He could choose to downplay or snub the summit to extract concessions, prioritize a domestic initiative, or avoid a setting he views as unfavorable. Low-probability health or security issues, or a significant international/domestic crisis, could also derail travel. A shift in the summit dates out of June would cause this question to resolve No even if he attends later. \n\nWhy not lower: Skipping would be an extraordinary step with significant diplomatic costs. The summit offers a prime stage to pressure allies on defense spending—central to Trump’s messaging—so he has strong incentive to appear. Allies expect US presidential attendance, and the White House typically aligns schedules around such events. \n\nUpdate triggers: Upward if the White House issues formal guidance confirming his travel, if allied governments publicly list him on leader attendance rosters, or if press pools report detailed schedule/timing. Downward if credible reports suggest he will send a representative instead, if a major crisis or health issue arises, or if NATO announces a date shift outside June or a cancellation. \n\nResearch assistant note: No additional new information provided beyond the known plan for a June 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the NATO Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Netherlands to host 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_225618.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a NATO summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the NATO Summit such that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
