  "information": "According to data from the Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), the inventory of new single-family homes for sale in the United States stood at 503,000 units in March 2025, an increase from 500,000 in February 2025. This level represents a multi-year high since November 2007. Historically, the number of new one-family homes for sale has only exceeded 550,000 during the 2006-2007 housing market peak, when levels reached between 570,000 and 580,000 units.\n\nData from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Department of Housing and Urban Development for March 2025 showed that new single-family home sales reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 724,000, which is up 6% year-over-year. The median sales price of new homes sold was $403,600, a decrease of 7.5% from the same period in the previous year. According to Freddie Mac, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate averaged 6.65% in March 2025 and rose to 6.83% in April 2025.\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, housing starts declined by 14.2% month-over-month in March 2025 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 940,000 units. In the same month, building permits for single-family homes decreased by 2% month-over-month. Builder confidence, as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index (HMI), was reported to be around 42.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months. The data for May 2025 is expected to be released by FRED in late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The number of new homes for sale was 503,000 in March 2025, with only a modest increase of 3,000 from the prior month. A continuation of this slow growth trend would not be sufficient to reach the 550,000 threshold in the next two months.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Persistently high mortgage rates continue to restrain buyer demand. In response, home builders, guided by low confidence (NAHB HMI of 42) and recent declines in permits and starts, continue to scale back construction. This slowdown in the supply pipeline prevents a rapid build-up of inventory, causing the number of new homes for sale to plateau or grow only marginally, staying below 550,000.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and severe drop in consumer demand, perhaps triggered by an unexpected negative economic shock, causes new home sales to plummet in April and May. Builders are unable to halt construction projects already underway, leading to a rapid accumulation of completed but unsold homes. This supply glut pushes the inventory figure above the 550,000 mark before builders can sufficiently adjust production.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong evidence that home builders are actively throttling back new construction, which will cap the rate of inventory growth. As of March 2025, the inventory stands at 503,000 units, requiring a substantial increase of 47,000 in just two months (April and May) to exceed the 550,000 threshold. While elevated mortgage rates (6.83% in April) are indeed pressuring demand and have contributed to inventory rising to its current 16-year high, leading indicators suggest the supply side is adjusting rapidly. The research data shows a sharp 14.2% month-over-month decline in housing starts and a 2% decrease in single-family permits in March. These figures, combined with a low builder confidence index of 42, signal a deliberate pullback to prevent oversupply. This proactive supply management makes a massive inventory surge of nearly 50,000 units in such a short period highly improbable. The most likely outcome is that the rate of new homes being completed and listed for sale will slow, bringing inventory growth to a near halt or even causing it to decline. My probability is not lower because the market is still soft; if sales falter more than expected in the immediate term, inventory could still rise significantly before the construction slowdown fully impacts the numbers. My probability is not higher because the leading indicators for future supply (starts and permits) are pointing decisively downward, creating a strong headwind against the kind of rapid inventory pile-up needed to resolve this question as 'Yes'. I would raise my probability if preliminary data for April showed a simultaneous collapse in new home sales and a surprise surge in housing completions. Conversely, I would lower it if April's housing starts and permits data showed an even steeper decline.",
