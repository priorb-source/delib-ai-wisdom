    "review": "Both forecasters sharpened the base-rate framing. The key correction is that a “typical” ~16-week activation from a March 13 license lands around July 3, slightly past our July 1 cutoff—so the status quo leans No. They also emphasized the absence of concrete go-live signals at week 9 (pricing, preorders, map “Q2” tiles), which reduces the odds of a 10–12 week fast track. Forecaster 2 added the useful point that Starlink sometimes batches map updates near quarter-end, which supports a late-June flip, but that’s an upside tail rather than baseline. I agree with both that logistics/admin friction in Chad can add weeks and that a single-cell activation would suffice, keeping a non-trivial Yes chance. Overall their arguments are persuasive to trim my estimate toward sub-50%.",
    "rationale": "Re-centering on the base rate: March 13 + 16 weeks ≈ July 3, implying the modal/median outcome misses the cutoff. The observed range is wide (10–24 weeks). We are ~9 weeks post-license with no public indicators of imminent launch, making the 10–12 week scenario less likely. The Airtel Africa partnership is a positive but may not translate to execution within ~6 weeks in a landlocked, lower-infrastructure market where import/type-approval/VAT/spectrum processes can slip. Countervailing forces remain: partial-area availability suffices, capacity over Chad is likely ample, and Starlink could push a Q2 map update late in June. Balancing these, I shift from a slightly optimistic stance to a near-coinflip but below 50%, reflecting that the central tendency lands just after the deadline while leaving room for a quarter-end acceleration. I would move up on evidence of finalized import/type-approval, posted local pricing, preorder acceptance, Airtel/ministerial comms pointing to June, or map tiles showing Q2 for Chad. I’d move down if by early June there’s still no pricing/preorder signal or if there are reports of customs/tax disputes or capacity pauses nearby.",
