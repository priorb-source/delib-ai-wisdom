    "review": "The other forecasters identified the same critical factors I did and reached remarkably similar conclusions (18-20% vs my 22%). Forecaster 2's mathematical modeling is particularly useful - showing that even if Judge hits an excellent .375 over the next 45 games, he'd drop to around .389. This concrete projection strengthens the regression case. Forecaster 3's emphasis on Judge's 'minimal cushion' of just 1 point above .400 is also apt. However, I don't see fundamentally new evidence or arguments beyond what I already considered. The tight clustering of our forecasts (18-22%) suggests we're all capturing the same probability space through similar reasoning. The consensus validates that this is the reasonable range given the tension between Judge's current .401 status and the overwhelming statistical/historical evidence for regression.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I'm making a modest downward adjustment from 22% to 20%. The mathematical modeling from Forecaster 2 slightly strengthens the regression case - even excellent .375 hitting leads to .389, below the threshold. The emphasis on Judge's minimal 1-point cushion is also valid and deserves more weight. However, the core tension remains: Judge IS at .401 with 42 days to go (favoring YES), but faces extraordinary statistical headwinds with his .481 BABIP vs .344 career average, .362 xBA, and zero players hitting .400 on July 1 in 25 years (favoring NO). The 20% forecast represents: (1) ~15% chance Judge maintains through luck/variance despite regression, (2) ~3% chance Freeman/Ohtani surge, (3) ~2% for other scenarios. I'm settling at 20% as the midpoint of the 18-22% range our group identified, reflecting that the minimal cushion and mathematical projections slightly favor the lower end, but Judge's current position and the 6-week timeframe prevent going lower.",
