    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling points I should incorporate. Both emphasize Mexico's consistent historical pattern of sub-3% unemployment more strongly than I did, with Forecaster 2 specifically noting 'structural labor market characteristics' that keep reported unemployment low - a valuable insight about Mexico's labor market dynamics I didn't explicitly consider. Forecaster 3's point about the precise 3.0% threshold is important: exactly 3.0% would count as No, not just rates above it, which adds a small but real risk factor. All three of us converged on similar reasoning about tariff lag effects and lack of Q1 2025 data, which validates these as the key considerations. The main difference is that they weighted the historical baseline somewhat more heavily than I did, landing at 65% versus my 58%.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe the other forecasters appropriately weight Mexico's strong historical track record. My initial 58% may have been overly cautious given: (1) Mexico's unemployment has been consistently low, not just occasionally, (2) Structural labor market features support this pattern, (3) Employment data's sticky nature makes sudden jumps unlikely, (4) April data captures conditions that predate most tariff implementation impacts. However, I maintain some additional caution because: (1) We truly lack visibility into Q1 2025 trends - the status quo could already be shifting, (2) The auto sector tariff concerns represent real economic headwinds, (3) The precise 3.0% threshold means even marginal deterioration matters. I'm updating my forecast upward to 62%, acknowledging the strength of the historical baseline argument while maintaining slightly more uncertainty than the other forecasters given the complete lack of 2025 data confirmation.",
