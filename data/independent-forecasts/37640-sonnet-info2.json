  "information": "The Energy Star program was launched in 1992 as a voluntary public-private partnership to certify energy-efficient products. Over its 33-year history, government figures and expert analyses estimate the program has saved consumers over $500 billion in energy costs and prevented 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. The program's annual cost is approximately $32 million, while it is credited with saving the average household around $450 per year.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "48 days (from May 14, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the website remains online",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration executes an unusually rapid shutdown of the Energy Star program, taking the unprecedented step of immediately taking down the EnergyStar.gov website within the next 48 days, possibly to make a political statement or demonstrate swift action on eliminating climate-related programs.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The website remains online due to bureaucratic processes, legal or administrative requirements for transitioning federal programs, the website being maintained as an archive during elimination, political pushback delaying implementation, or the website simply continuing to operate through standard government inertia despite program elimination announcements.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors the website remaining online. While the NYT article provides credible evidence that the Energy Star program is being eliminated, there is a critical distinction between eliminating a program and taking down its website within 48 days. Federal government operations typically move slowly - even when programs are terminated, their websites often remain accessible for months or years as archives, during transition periods, or simply due to bureaucratic inertia. The research assistant's information shows this is a 33-year-old program with significant stakeholder integration (manufacturers, retailers, consumers), which makes instantaneous shutdown logistically complex. Historical precedent suggests that federal websites persist long after program elimination decisions are announced. The $32 million annual cost and deep integration into consumer product markets means there are likely contractual, legal, and administrative processes that cannot be completed in 48 days. My forecast is not higher (closer to 95%+) because there IS credible reporting of active elimination efforts, and the current administration might move with unusual speed. It's not lower because the timeframe is simply too short for typical government processes, even expedited ones. To revise upward, I would need evidence of explicit decisions to maintain the website or legal/political barriers to elimination. To revise downward, I would need concrete evidence of active website shutdown procedures already underway with specific timelines before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Energy Star program was launched in 1992 as a voluntary public-private partnership to certify energy-efficient products. Over its 33-year history, government figures and expert analyses estimate the program has saved consumers over $500 billion in energy costs and prevented 4 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. The program's annual cost is approximately $32 million, while it is credited with saving the average household around $450 per year.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
