    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides compelling quantitative analysis showing that three concrete factors (IMF disbursement ~16B, domestic borrowing ~26B, FX valuation ~9-11B UAH) total 51-53B UAH gross increase - substantially exceeding the 31B UAH needed even after accounting for debt servicing. Their 90% forecast is well-supported by this mathematical buffer. Forecaster 3 raises valid concerns about EU loan timing and historical baseline probabilities, but may underweight the certainty of the three confirmed factors. Their 70% seems too cautious given that even without the EU loan, the other sources provide a strong path to the threshold. The key insight from both is the importance of net vs gross increases - debt servicing costs matter. However, servicing described as 'modest' is unlikely to eliminate a 51-53B gross increase. Forecaster 2's argument that the forecast doesn't depend on the EU loan is particularly strong.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I find Forecaster 2's quantitative approach most persuasive. The arithmetic is straightforward: confirmed IMF disbursement (~16B UAH) + typical domestic bond auctions (~26B UAH) + mechanical FX valuation effect from 0.7% depreciation (~9-11B UAH) = 51-53B UAH gross increase. Even with debt servicing costs of 20B UAH (higher than 'modest' suggests), this leaves 31-33B UAH net increase, meeting or exceeding the 30.5B threshold. This doesn't require the EU loan, which strengthens the case. Forecaster 3's concern about EU timing is noted, but the base case without it still appears sufficient. My original 82% was reasonable but slightly conservative. The multiple independent confirmation sources and large mathematical buffer justify higher confidence. I'm updating to 85% to reflect the strong quantitative evidence while maintaining appropriate caution for: (1) the March data hasn't been officially confirmed as published yet, (2) exact debt servicing costs could vary from estimates, and (3) domestic auction proceeds might differ from the ~26B average. The update is modest because my original analysis already captured these core factors.",
