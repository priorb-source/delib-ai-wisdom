    "review": "The other forecasters raised several critical points I had initially underweighteda. Forecaster 3's argument about the typical cadence of announcements from sports federations—often tied to scheduled congresses or major events—is particularly compelling. I had not researched the ITKF's specific calendar, and this institutional inertia is a strong reason to doubt a quick, ad-hoc announcement. Both forecasters rightly emphasized that a high-level discussion, however positive, is not a confirmed decision, and that the lack of any corroborating information is a significant negative signal. They correctly applied a 'status quo bias,' where the default outcome (no announcement) is more likely in the absence of overwhelming evidence for change. My initial forecast was an overreaction to a single positive news report.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward from 85% to 40%. The reasoning provided by the other forecasters was highly persuasive and exposed a major flaw in my initial analysis. I had placed too much weight on the positive tone of the meeting between the Egyptian Sports Minister and the ITKF President, interpreting it as a signal that an announcement was practically a formality. \n\nThe other analysts correctly pointed out that institutional processes often delay such announcements. A decision may be made in principle, but the formal announcement could be deliberately timed to coincide with a future ITKF General Assembly or another major event, which may well be after the July 1 deadline. The complete lack of any other supporting information or even a hint of an imminent announcement on the ITKF's official channels is a strong counter-signal.\n\nHowever, I am remaining slightly more optimistic than the other forecasters (40% vs. 28-30%). The key piece of evidence—a personal visit by the ITKF President to the Sports Minister of a bidding country—is a very strong positive indicator that goes beyond simple 'discussions.' It signals the final stages of a negotiation. While institutional norms often dictate announcement timing, the public nature of this meeting and the 2026 deadline create pressure to finalize the decision soon. It is plausible that this high-level political engagement could expedite the process, leading to a simple online announcement within the short timeframe. Therefore, while I now believe 'No' is the more likely outcome, I see a stronger chance for 'Yes' than my peers.",
