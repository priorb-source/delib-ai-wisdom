    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully stresses the latest (late‑May) indications that may show Ishiba edging Starmer on Morning Consult and the tie-as-No penalty; that nudges the status quo toward No and highlights near-term UK downside from the June 11 spending review. Forecaster 3 pushes back by prioritizing the medium‑run MC pattern (Starmer modestly higher) and cautions that late‑May figures might be transient or not strictly comparable, which I largely agree with. Both correctly emphasize MC’s 7‑day smoothing and the narrow overlapping bands for both leaders. Net: F2 adds weight on recency and policy-risk asymmetry; F3 reinforces the historical spread and structural headwinds for Ishiba. I find F3’s reliance on the medium-run MC pattern convincing, but I also accept F2’s point that the most recent snapshot and the tie penalty shave some edge off a bullish Yes position.",
    "rationale": "Baseline remains that Starmer has tended to run a few points above Ishiba on MC in early 2025, consistent with broader Japanese PM approval norms (high‑20s/low‑30s). However, the late‑May reports of Starmer ~28% vs Ishiba ~32% suggest a possible near-term crossover. With only about a month left and MC’s 7‑day average reducing volatility, a narrow ordering on July 1 is likely to reflect trends visible by mid/late June.\n\nDrivers over June:\n- UK: Risks from the June 11 spending review (civil service cuts) and ongoing political noise could trim Starmer a point or two. Potential macro tailwinds (rate‑cut expectations, disinflation) and incumbency stabilization could support low‑30s. Net: slightly negative skew versus early May.\n- Japan: Scandal impacts appear to have partially faded; a stabilization in the low‑30s is plausible if wage growth headlines continue. However, sustained mid‑30s seems unlikely without a positive shock, and yen weakness or renewed LDP funding headlines could drag approvals back to the high‑20s.\n\nGiven the closeness, the tie‑counts‑as‑No rule, and the possibility that the late‑May crossover persists into early July, I trim my Yes probability modestly from my prior. I still lean Yes because the medium‑run MC pattern and structural factors make Starmer ≥ Ishiba slightly more likely than not, but the edge is small.",
