    "review": "Both forecasters strengthened the case for Yes with two points I underweighted: (1) the resolution language is “on or after July 1,” which slightly reduces the risk that a brief, unlucky outage at a single instant yields a No; and (2) DOE co-stewardship/history increases the likelihood of a maintained redirect or archival presence even if EPA winds the program down. Their emphasis on GSA/CISA/NARA processes and records obligations aligns with my view, but they articulated the procedural friction more explicitly. I find their reasoning convincing and directionally consistent with my prior, with the “on or after” nuance modestly reducing my downtime tail risk.",
    "rationale": "Time left is short (~7 weeks), and energystar.gov is currently up. Federal domain decommissioning typically entails approvals, records/archiving, and coordination with GSA/CISA/NARA, which rarely completes this quickly. Even if the program is eliminated, optics, stakeholder reliance (e.g., Portfolio Manager, retailer/manufacturer references), and legal/records considerations favor keeping the domain reachable—at least as a static notice or redirect—which would still register as “up” to the resolution source. The “on or after July 1” phrasing slightly mitigates the risk that a transient outage at a precise moment forces a No. Residual risks include an unusually aggressive, symbolic takedown with DNS removal before July 1, a misconfigured consolidation/redirect causing sustained downtime, or a TLS/DNS lapse coinciding with Metaculus’s check. Given the short runway and typical government web change cadence, these seem low probability. Incorporating the deliberation insights, I slightly raise my estimate to reflect reduced transient-outage risk and the DOE continuity angle.",
