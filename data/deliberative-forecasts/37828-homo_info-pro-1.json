    "review": "The other forecasters introduced two crucial pieces of evidence I had not considered, both of which strongly support a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 2's citation of CEO Parker Conrad's direct statements in May 2025 that an IPO is 'not imminent' and that there are 'no specific plans' is a powerful signal of near-term intent. Forecaster 3's point about the ongoing, high-profile lawsuit with competitor Deel is also highly compelling; such legal uncertainty and management distraction is a significant headwind for a company preparing to face public market scrutiny. I found the reasoning from both forecasters to be convincing. However, I believe Forecaster 3's probability of 15% is too high given the strength of the negative evidence they themselves presented, particularly the lawsuit. The arguments from both forecasters have solidified my conviction in a very low probability for a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. My initial reasoning was based on the company's recent actions: a large Series G funding round and a significant tender offer in May 2025. These events provide a long cash runway and employee liquidity, substantially reducing the immediate need and internal pressure for an IPO. The deliberation process reinforced this view significantly. The new information—the CEO's explicit denial of imminent IPO plans and the existence of a major, distracting lawsuit with Deel—adds two more powerful arguments against an announcement before the July 1, 2025, deadline. The confluence of financial strategy (recent funding), executive communication (CEO statements), and legal context (Deel lawsuit) all point squarely to Rippling focusing on its private growth trajectory for the near future. An IPO announcement within the next five weeks would contradict all of these strong signals. Therefore, while I do not feel the need to update my probability, my confidence in this low forecast has increased.",
