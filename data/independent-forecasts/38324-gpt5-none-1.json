    "status_quo_outcome": "No — debt remains below $37T by June 27, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Debt ceiling dynamics and ordinary deficit financing keep Total Public Debt Outstanding in the mid–$35T to mid–$36T range through late June. Even if unconstrained, 23 days of net borrowing (~$5–10B/day) cannot add the ~$0.5–$1.5T required unless the level is already extremely close to $37T.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Congress lifts/suspends the debt limit in early June and Treasury rapidly issues to refill the TGA and unwind extraordinary measures, on top of ongoing deficits, pushing the total above $37T by June 27. This likely requires starting debt near ~$36.6T+ and an unusually large, fast TGA rebuild.",
    "rationale": "- Context: We are ~3 weeks from the resolution date. The relevant metric is Total Public Debt Outstanding on Treasury’s Debt to the Penny. The research assistant had no added info, so I rely on recent trend and typical Treasury operations.\n- Status quo and growth rate: Over the past couple of years, debt has risen roughly $1.5–$2.5T per year (~$4–$7B/day on average), with occasional faster bursts after debt-limit resolutions. Over just 23 days, normal net borrowing would contribute roughly $100–$250B—far short of what’s needed to bridge to $37T unless we are already within a few hundred billion.\n- Debt ceiling considerations: The debt limit was reinstated in early 2025. Historically, when the ceiling binds, Treasury uses extraordinary measures, which restrain recorded totals until a resolution. Many analyses anticipated an X-date in mid-to-late summer 2025, implying no resolution by late June is plausible. If so, the measured total would still be well below $37T by June 27.\n- Even if resolved soon: After a resolution, Treasury typically refills the TGA and unwinds extraordinary measures, which can produce a sizeable, rapid increase (hundreds of billions, occasionally approaching ~$1T over several weeks). To exceed $37T by June 27, the starting level would likely need to be around $36.6T+ by mid-June and the issuance surge would need to be unusually large and fast. Additionally, June quarterly tax receipts (mid-June) temporarily reduce net borrowing, working against a large late-June jump.\n- Why not higher: It would require both an imminent ceiling resolution and a very high starting level (already near $37T), plus an aggressive TGA rebuild schedule within a narrow 2–3 week window. That confluence is possible but not the base case.\n- Why not lower: Debt growth has been rapid in recent years, and if the ceiling has already been addressed earlier in 2025, the outstanding total could plausibly be in the high-$36T range. A large issuance program could conceivably tip it over $37T, so the probability isn’t near zero.\n- What would change my view upward: (1) Observing Debt to the Penny prints ≥$36.6T by mid-June; (2) Congressional passage of a ceiling suspension/raise in early June with Treasury guidance indicating a swift TGA rebuild toward ~$800B–$1T before June 27; (3) Evidence of unusually large near-term net bill issuance schedules.\n- What would change my view downward: (1) Continued reports that the ceiling remains binding into late June; (2) Daily prints remaining ≤$36.2T by mid-June; (3) Treasury signaling modest TGA targets or delayed refills beyond June.\n- Summary: Given time remaining, typical debt accumulation rates, and the likely debt-ceiling timeline, “No” is the favored outcome.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
