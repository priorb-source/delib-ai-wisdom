    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling points I initially underweighted. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes the July 1 implementation date as a 'forcing function' creating political pressure for timely passage, and notes that the VAT exemption provision itself has broad support, making it less likely to be the source of delay. Forecaster 3 provides valuable procedural insights, particularly that the National Assembly can move quickly on fiscal legislation when prioritized (citing Finance Acts as precedent), and that the President can sign immediately rather than using the full 30-day window. Both note that House passage is a significant milestone already achieved, reducing remaining hurdles.\n\nHowever, I find Forecaster 2's 65% somewhat optimistic given the demonstrated slippage (Q1 deadline missed) and compressed timeline. Forecaster 3's 58% appears more calibrated, balancing executive priority and momentum against procedural risks. Their identification of specific calendar constraints (Eid al-Adha in early June, potential recesses) adds useful granularity.\n\nThe key insight I underweighted is distinguishing between the popular VAT exemption provision and the controversial elements of the broader package. While labor opposition could slow the entire bill, the specific provision we're forecasting on has political tailwinds.",
    "rationale": "Reviewing my original 45% forecast, I was likely too anchored on status quo bias and the missed Q1 deadline. While these remain valid concerns, I insufficiently weighted several factors: (1) House passage represents approximately 50% of the legislative journey already complete; (2) The July 1 implementation date creates genuine political pressure given public commitments; (3) Historical precedent shows Nigeria's National Assembly can expedite fiscal legislation when prioritized; (4) The VAT exemption itself faces minimal opposition, with controversy centered on other package elements; (5) With 57 days remaining, there is adequate time if the government treats this as urgent.\n\nThat said, real risks persist: the Q1 miss signals meaningful process friction, labor union opposition (even if not targeting this provision) could delay the entire package, Senate procedures remain uncertain, and potential harmonization needs could consume time. The calendar is also constrained by Eid observances and potential recesses.\n\nBalancing stronger-than-I-initially-assessed momentum against persistent procedural uncertainty, I'm updating upward but remaining below the other forecasters' estimates. The truth likely lies between my original pessimism and Forecaster 2's optimism.",
