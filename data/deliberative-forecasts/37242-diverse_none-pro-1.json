    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the core drivers of this forecast. We all correctly identified that the timing of the Easter holiday is the single most dominant factor, creating a massive structural tailwind for year-on-year growth in April 2025 compared to April 2024. We also concur that the general post-pandemic tourism trend is positive and that the provided news article about US policy is a red herring, given the US is a very small source market. The main point of divergence is the precise probability assigned to a 'Yes' outcome (a decline), which reflects differing assessments of tail risks. Forecaster 2's 25% seems too high and inadequately justified against the powerful Easter effect. Forecaster 3's analysis at 15% is very convincing, as they specifically articulated plausible downside risks that I had grouped more generally, such as operational disruptions (strikes), weakness in the domestic/inter-island market, and a potentially high base from 2024. Their reasoning provides a solid basis for slightly increasing the probability of a decline.",
    "rationale": "My original reasoning remains largely intact: the shift of the entire Easter holiday period into April 2025, compared to its position mostly in March in 2024, is an overwhelmingly strong factor that makes year-on-year growth extremely likely. The ongoing positive trend in tourism arrivals, evidenced by the February 2025 data, further supports this conclusion. However, the deliberation has convinced me to slightly increase my forecast for a decline. Forecaster 3 made excellent points about specific, plausible downside risks that could, in aggregate, counteract the Easter effect. These include operational disruptions like airline or air traffic control strikes, which are not uncommon during peak holiday periods, and potential weakness in the domestic market segment. Furthermore, I am giving more weight to the real-world anti-tourism protests that occurred in the Canary Islands during April 2025. While unlikely to cause mass cancellations of pre-booked holidays, they could have dampened last-minute travel and represent a concrete negative event. Considering these specific, articulated risks, my initial 10% felt slightly overconfident. I am therefore updating my forecast upwards to better account for the small but non-trivial probability of these negative factors combining to cause a surprise decline.",
