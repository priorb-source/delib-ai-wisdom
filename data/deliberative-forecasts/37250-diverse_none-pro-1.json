    "review": "The other two forecasters arrived at a consensus forecast of 8%, significantly higher than my initial 2%. Their reasoning is broadly similar to my own, acknowledging the low base rate of return for a deportee and the immense legal and bureaucratic barriers, especially within the short two-month timeframe. However, they place more weight on the possibility of a non-standard outcome. The key new argument, articulated well by Forecaster 3, is that the public notability of this case—evidenced by its own Wikipedia article—modestly increases the probability of an exceptional event, such as advocacy-induced humanitarian parole, a sudden court order, or even an irregular entry that gets credibly reported. I find this reasoning persuasive, as public and political pressure is one of the few factors that can expedite otherwise glacial immigration processes.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 2% was heavily anchored on the standard operating procedures and timelines of the U.S. immigration system, which make a return within two months extremely unlikely for any deportee. Upon reviewing my peers' analyses, I believe I under-weighted the specific features of this case. The public attention Mr. Abrego Garcia's case has received makes it an outlier compared to the 'average' deportation case. This notoriety increases the potential for successful political or legal advocacy that could result in an expedited, non-standard path to return, such as humanitarian parole. While the lack of any current news suggesting such a push is underway remains a powerful argument for a low probability, the other forecasters have convinced me that the potential for a surprise is higher than I first estimated. I am updating my forecast upward to reflect this reassessment. I am moving from 2% to 6%. I am not moving all the way to their 8% consensus because I remain highly skeptical given the complete absence of any new, positive information and the profound inertia of the system, but I acknowledge my initial forecast was too low.",
