    "review": "All three forecasters have converged on a remarkably tight range of 50-54%, which suggests we're interpreting the evidence similarly. Forecaster 2 and 3 both use the same two-step probability structure I employed, with fight occurrence around 85-90% and Pyfer's win probability if fighting around 55-60%. Forecaster 3 raises a valid point I hadn't explicitly considered: the Newark, New Jersey location could provide a modest home advantage for Pyfer. This is worth noting, though home advantage in UFC is typically smaller than in team sports. Forecaster 3 also adds ~2% for the possibility of a late replacement opponent, which is creative but speculative - if Gastelum withdrew, the replacement could be easier or harder for Pyfer. Forecaster 2's emphasis on 'MMA's inherent unpredictability' is well-taken and provides good justification for not pushing the forecast higher. However, none of these points represent major new information that fundamentally changes the calculus. The consensus clustering around 50-54% reinforces that this is genuinely close to a coin flip, with Pyfer having a modest edge based on recent form and physical advantages, but facing a dangerous veteran opponent.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, my original reasoning holds up well. The key components remain: (1) approximately 87% probability the fight occurs, based on it being scheduled 12 days out with both fighters apparently healthy, despite Pyfer's previous withdrawal; (2) approximately 60% probability Pyfer wins if the fight happens, based on his momentum (6 of last 7 wins, recent knockout), physical advantages (reach, grappling), but tempered by Gastelum's veteran experience (24th UFC fight, TUF 17 winner). The home location in Newark provides a minor additional edge I hadn't quantified, perhaps worth 1-2 percentage points. However, Forecaster 2's caution about MMA unpredictability is valid - upsets happen regularly. The tight consensus among all three forecasters (50-54%) validates that this is genuinely uncertain. My 52% forecast appropriately reflects Pyfer as a slight favorite without overconfidence. I'm not adjusting because the new considerations (home advantage, late replacement possibility) are approximately offset by the reminder of unpredictability, and my forecast already sits in the middle of the expert consensus range.",
