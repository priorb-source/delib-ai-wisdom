    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base-rate and structural arguments: the State Department rarely assigns countrywide Level 4 absent war/state collapse, major embassy posture changes, or nationwide threats. They add two useful nuances: (1) the cyclone season tapering reduces near-term disaster-trigger risk; and (2) the potential impact of SADC/Rwandan force posture on insurgency dynamics in Cabo Delgado. Neither presents evidence of current nationwide destabilization or U.S. Embassy drawdown signals. Overall, their reasoning strengthens the case for a slightly lower probability in the short window.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~60 days. Mozambique’s typical pattern is Level 2/3 with area-specific “Do Not Travel” in Cabo Delgado, and State tends to reserve Level 4 for nationwide crises or when consular support is degraded. The ATTA advisory amid protests suggests localized unrest, not a systemic nationwide breakdown. With cyclone season largely past, a catastrophic natural-disaster trigger is less likely in May–June. Base rates for new Level 4 countrywide designations over such a short horizon are low. A Yes outcome would likely require an abrupt, severe shock: multiple major attacks or sustained violent unrest in Maputo/southern cities, a nationwide state of emergency with lethal crackdowns, a sharp embassy posture change (authorized/ordered departure), or a catastrophic disaster. Lacking such signals, I slightly trim my estimate. I would update upward on credible reports of insurgent spread beyond the north, sustained nationwide unrest, or U.S. Embassy drawdown notices; downward if stability persists and embassy posture remains normal into June.",
