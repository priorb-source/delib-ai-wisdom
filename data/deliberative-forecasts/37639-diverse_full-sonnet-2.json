    "review": "Both forecasters provided analyses that closely align with mine, with all three forecasts clustering between 15-18%. They identified the same key factors: the May 11 TRO extension based on 'plausible' constitutional claims, multiple layers of legal protection, compressed timeline, and political pressure. However, they raised several points I hadn't fully elaborated: (1) Forecaster 3's 'procedural cascade' framing - showing that for a Yes outcome, the district court must deny the PI quickly, the Third Circuit must deny an administrative stay, AND ICE must have logistics ready, all within 6.5 weeks; (2) The institutional constraint that ICE rarely risks contempt by violating a live court order, even under political pressure; (3) The additional buffer of appellate administrative stays that can preserve status quo while emergency appeals are considered. These are compelling points that strengthen the case for a lower probability. Both forecasters converged on exactly 15%, suggesting careful calibration.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find their procedural cascade argument particularly persuasive. For deportation to occur by July 1, multiple sequential steps must align: the federal judge must deny the preliminary injunction and dissolve the TRO on an expedited schedule, Khalil's team must fail to obtain an administrative stay from the Third Circuit, and ICE must execute removal within days - all while the separate BIA appeal remains pending. This is a more granular breakdown than I initially provided, and it highlights how many potential failure points exist for the government. The institutional constraint point about ICE risking contempt is also significant - even with intense political pressure, federal agencies operate within legal frameworks where violating court orders carries serious consequences. However, I maintain slightly more weight than the other forecasters on the political pressure dynamic. The Trump administration's revocation of 1,000+ visas and Secretary Rubio's direct involvement suggest an unusually aggressive posture. The immigration judge's deportation order also provides a legal foundation that could facilitate expedited action if judicial barriers fall. While the 'plausible' finding is meaningful, it's a lower threshold than 'likely to succeed on the merits.' Balancing the strong procedural protections and institutional constraints against the unique political context and existing deportation order, I'm adjusting downward but not to the full 15%.",
