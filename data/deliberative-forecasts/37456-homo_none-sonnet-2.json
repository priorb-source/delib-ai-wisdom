    "review": "The other forecasters provide well-reasoned analyses that largely align with my own thinking. Forecaster 3's argument about institutional/food service distribution being easier to track than retail is a valuable point I hadn't explicitly considered - fewer distribution endpoints could indeed facilitate faster product recovery verification. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the status quo bias and noting that many recalls extend beyond 3 months is also compelling. All three of us converge on the 30-43% range, suggesting reasonable consensus. The key insight from the collective analysis is that while 95 days is sufficient for some recalls, it represents a moderately compressed timeline given typical USDA/FSIS thoroughness requirements. The most significant shared concern is that 40 days have already elapsed without closure, which suggests this isn't an exceptionally simple case.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' reasoning, I maintain that my original analysis was sound but can be refined. The strongest new consideration is Forecaster 3's point about food service distribution channels being more tractable than retail, which provides a modest positive update. However, this is counterbalanced by the reinforced observation that 40 days have passed without closure, strengthening the status quo bias argument. Forecaster 2's explicit mention that many recalls extend beyond 3 months is sobering, though Forecaster 3's 60-180 day range suggests 95 days is plausible. The cleaning solution contamination remains a relatively straightforward issue compared to pathogens, but FSIS's thoroughness requirements for verification don't change. Given the consensus range of 30-43%, and weighing the competing considerations (institutional distribution favoring faster closure vs. 40 days already elapsed favoring slower process), I'm adjusting slightly downward from 42% to 40%. This reflects greater weight on the status quo bias while acknowledging the reasonable timeframe remains intact.",
