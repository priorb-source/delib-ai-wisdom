  "information": "Reports from various news outlets indicate several planned or recent mobilizations. The Free Press Journal reported on a planned march involving 10,000 farmers. India Today has covered rallies organized by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) for teachers. Additionally, a global housing action day protest was scheduled for April 26, 2025, with events planned in multiple countries, including India.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Large-scale protests are a regular feature of India's political landscape, and the Global Protest Tracker has a history of documenting them.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The next two months see a period of relative calm, and planned protests either fail to materialize, are suppressed, or do not reach the 10,000 participant threshold. A qualifying protest could also occur but not be captured by the specific tracking source.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A planned protest, such as the farmers' march mentioned in reports, goes ahead and is documented. Alternatively, a new grievance related to political, economic, or religious issues triggers a mass mobilization that is recorded by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 80% is based on the high frequency of large-scale protests in India and several specific, near-term potential triggers. The historical data from the Global Protest Tracker itself establishes a strong base rate; it has recorded multiple protests in India exceeding 10,000 participants in the past year alone, making a two-month period without one statistically unlikely. \n\nThe forecast is further strengthened by current events. My research assistant's report points to a planned farmers' march explicitly stated to involve 10,000 people, which directly aligns with the question's criteria. It also notes political rallies by the Trinamool Congress and ongoing tensions highlighted by the recent violent protests against a land law, as reported by Reuters. These represent multiple, independent potential pathways to a 'Yes' outcome. The resolution criteria, which depend only on the protest's start date being before July 1, 2025, and not on the date it is entered into the tracker, mitigates the risk of a reporting lag influencing the outcome.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 80% because the timeframe is short, and the exact timing of social unrest is inherently unpredictable. Planned protests can be cancelled, postponed, or fail to gain traction. The 20% probability of a 'No' outcome accounts for this uncertainty and the chance of an unusually quiet two-month period. \n\nConversely, the probability is not lower because the confluence of a high base rate and several active, plausible triggers makes a 'No' outcome the less likely scenario. To forecast a lower probability, I would need to see evidence of successful de-escalation of current tensions or significant preventative actions by authorities that would suppress mobilization.\n\nI would update my forecast upwards if media reports confirm a specific date and large-scale mobilization plan for the farmers' march or another major protest. I would update downwards if key protest groups announced a postponement of activities or if there were a major political settlement related to current grievances.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in India with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nA protest with at least 10,000 participants that is active at the launch of this question does not count for resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nReports from various news outlets indicate several planned or recent mobilizations. The Free Press Journal reported on a planned march involving 10,000 farmers. India Today has covered rallies organized by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) for teachers. Additionally, a global housing action day protest was scheduled for April 26, 2025, with events planned in multiple countries, including India.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
