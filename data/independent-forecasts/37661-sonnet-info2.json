  "information": "In mid-May 2025, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, along with other Senate Democrats, called for a federal investigation into whether the Trump administration helped SpaceX secure foreign deals, including in Bangladesh. The senators allege that favorable treatment from foreign governments may have been exchanged for tariff favors, which they described as potential 'crony capitalism' and a 'quid pro quo' that could violate federal ethics laws. They have written to the Department of Justice and the White House ethics office requesting a probe into the matter.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 45 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Bangladesh is not currently listed as Available on the Starlink map, and the status quo would be for it to remain unlisted by the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite receiving final approval from Bangladeshi leadership, SpaceX does not complete the technical, regulatory, and operational requirements to list Bangladesh as Available before July 1. This could occur due to: the very tight 45-day timeframe proving insufficient for deployment; the ongoing Senate investigation causing SpaceX to slow or pause the rollout to avoid further political scrutiny; unexpected technical or logistical challenges; or bureaucratic delays in finalizing implementation details even after high-level approval",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "SpaceX moves swiftly following the final approval from Bangladesh's leadership, completing all necessary infrastructure setup, regulatory filings, and operational preparations within 45 days. The company updates its availability map to show Bangladesh as Available before July 1, demonstrating that pre-existing preparations allowed for rapid deployment once approval was secured, and the political investigation does not materially slow the rollout timeline",
    "rationale": "The key tension in this forecast is between the positive signal of 'final approval' from Bangladeshi leadership and the very short 45-day window until the resolution date. The research assistant's report about Senate Democrats calling for an investigation into potential quid pro quo arrangements is concerning and adds political risk that could slow deployment. While 'final approval' suggests high-level authorization is complete, typical country launches for Starlink involve months of preparation - technical infrastructure deployment, local partnerships, regulatory compliance, and operational setup. 45 days is an aggressive timeline. The investigation adds uncertainty: even if it doesn't legally prevent deployment, it may make SpaceX more cautious or cause Bangladesh to pause. However, if SpaceX had been preparing infrastructure in advance of approval, a quick launch is possible. The base rate for such rapid deployment seems low (perhaps 20-30% if approval alone were the factor). Status quo bias strongly favors No - the current state is that Bangladesh is not listed, and most things don't change quickly. I'm not going higher because: the timeframe is very tight, typical rollouts take longer, and the political investigation introduces meaningful uncertainty. I'm not going lower because: final approval has been given by the country's leader, SpaceX has demonstrated ability to move quickly in some markets, and 'Available' on the map may require less than full service deployment. I would update higher with: news of imminent launch, statements confirming near-term activation, or evidence of advanced preparation. I would update lower with: investigation intensifying, news of delays, or no launch progress in the next 2-3 weeks",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Bangladesh as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Bangladeshi leader gives final approval to Musk's Starlink service](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/bangladeshi-leader-gives-final-approval-to-musks-starlink-service/3551404)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Bangladesh listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn mid-May 2025, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, along with other Senate Democrats, called for a federal investigation into whether the Trump administration helped SpaceX secure foreign deals, including in Bangladesh.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
