  "information": "Under Ukrainian law, specifically Article 19 of the Law “On the Legal Regime of Martial Law,” scheduling or holding national elections is forbidden while martial law is in effect. On May 15, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) voted to prolong martial law and general mobilization until at least August 6, 2025. The parliamentary rules of procedure also stipulate that once martial law is lifted, the date for the next presidential election must be set no less than 90 days in advance.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's office officially denied media reports suggesting that presidential elections were being planned for July 2025. Sources within the president's office and the Ukrainian government told BBC News Ukraine that no meetings had been held nor instructions given to prepare for elections, labeling the reports as 'fake or manipulative information.' President Zelensky has repeatedly stated that the question of holding elections can only be considered after the conflict is resolved.\n\nFormer President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced on February 16, 2025, that the next presidential elections will take place on October 26, 2025. He claimed his information came from multiple sources, including the Office of the President, law enforcement agencies, the Central Election Commission, and a printing plant which, he alleged, was already calculating the number of ballots required. This followed earlier reports in March 2025 from The Economist, which, citing anonymous sources in the Ukrainian government, had suggested President Zelensky was planning to announce a surprise election for July 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until 2025-06-30 23:59 Kyiv time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — with martial law extended to at least Aug 6, 2025 and current law barring scheduling elections under martial law, no presidential election date is announced before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Martial law remains in force through June; no legal changes to permit scheduling; Zelensky’s office maintains its stance that elections are only considered after the conflict; the Verkhovna Rada and CEC make no announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid political/legal shift: either martial law is lifted in June or the Rada amends law to allow scheduling under martial law; the competent authority (likely the Rada) then sets and officially announces a specific election date (e.g., in late Oct/Nov 2025) before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No. Ukrainian law (Article 19 of the Law on the Legal Regime of Martial Law) forbids conducting and, per common interpretation, scheduling national elections during martial law. On May 15, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada extended martial law until at least Aug 6, 2025. President Zelensky’s office has explicitly denied reports of planning a July election and reiterated that elections are to be considered only after the conflict. Additionally, election law/procedure requires that once martial law is lifted, the election date must be set at least 90 days in advance; with martial law currently due to run to Aug 6, an Oct 26 election date (as claimed by Poroshenko) would require scheduling by late July—still during martial law—creating a legal inconsistency unless the law or martial law status changes. These factors make a pre–July 1 announcement highly unlikely. \n\nWhy not higher: A Yes requires multiple unlikely steps within ~6 weeks: either early termination of martial law or rapid legislative changes to allow scheduling under martial law, plus swift political consensus to announce a date. Recent actions (fresh extension to Aug 6 and official denials) point the other way. \n\nWhy not lower: I allow a small tail for sudden developments—e.g., a ceasefire or major de-escalation prompting early lifting of martial law; a tightly coordinated legal amendment enabling scheduling under martial law; or clear, credible parliamentary movement (draft bills, emergency sessions) to set a date before July 1. \n\nWhat would move me up: Reports of (a) a government-backed bill to permit scheduling under martial law, (b) plans to lift martial law in June, (c) credible, on-record statements from the Rada leadership or CEC about imminent scheduling, or (d) a significant security breakthrough/ceasefire. \n\nWhat would move me down: Continued firm denials from top officials, no legislative activity on election scheduling, and reaffirmations that martial law will remain through August with no exceptions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine announce a presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Next Ukrainian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_presidential_election)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nUnder Ukrainian law, specifically Article 19 of the Law “On the Legal Regime of Martial Law,” scheduling or holding national elections is forbidden while martial law is in effect.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
