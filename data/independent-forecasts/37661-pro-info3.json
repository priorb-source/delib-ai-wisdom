  "information": "The typical time between Starlink receiving a license and service being listed as 'Available' in a country has ranged from under three months to over one year. Faster rollouts have generally occurred in countries that issued express government invitations and where Starlink had an existing ground station or permission to use foreign gateways. SpaceX can serve Bangladesh using its existing laser-linked satellites without waiting for local gateways to be built. Following the license approval, it was reported that Starlink is preparing a tariff plan to be submitted to the Bangladeshi regulator for review.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, May 16, 2025, the Starlink availability map does not list Bangladesh as 'Available'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the high-level approval, the final regulatory steps, such as the review and approval of Starlink's tariff plan by the Bangladeshi Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC), encounter standard bureaucratic delays that push the official service launch past the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by the 'final approval' from the nation's leader, the BTRC expedites the review of Starlink's tariff plan. With the regulatory path cleared and technical service ready via laser-linked satellites, Starlink updates its map to show Bangladesh as 'Available' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The primary factor influencing this forecast is the recent 'final approval' from the Bangladeshi Prime Minister. This is a powerful signal of strong political will, which typically accelerates administrative processes. While the status quo is 'No' and the remaining timeframe of ~1.5 months is short compared to typical multi-month rollouts, this situation is not typical. The research notes that SpaceX can serve Bangladesh with its existing laser-linked satellites, removing the significant potential delay of building local ground stations. The main remaining hurdle is the regulatory approval of a tariff plan. The high-level political backing makes a swift approval more likely than not. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the deadline is very close. Any minor, unforeseen complication or even standard bureaucratic processing times within the BTRC could easily consume the available 45 days, pushing the launch just past the deadline. Bureaucratic inertia is a significant force to overcome, even with political pressure.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because dismissing the impact of a direct, final approval from a country's leader would be a mistake. This action signals that roadblocks are expected to be cleared. Given that the technical infrastructure is essentially in place, the final step is paperwork, which can be expedited under such circumstances. \n\nI would increase my forecast upon news that the tariff plan has been officially submitted or is in the final stages of review. I would decrease it upon reports of regulatory pushback or statements from officials indicating a more protracted review process.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Bangladesh as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Bangladeshi leader gives final approval to Musk's Starlink service](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/bangladeshi-leader-gives-final-approval-to-musks-starlink-service/3551404)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Bangladesh listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe typical time between Starlink receiving a license and service being listed as 'Available' in a country has ranged from under three months to over one year. Faster rollouts have generally occurred in countries that issued express government invitations and where Starlink had an existing ground station or permission to use foreign gateways.

Following the license approval, it was reported that Starlink is preparing a tariff plan to be submitted to the Bangladeshi regulator for review.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
