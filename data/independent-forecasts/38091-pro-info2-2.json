  "information": "The United Arab Emirates hosted an international Artemis Accords workshop in Abu Dhabi on May 21-22, 2025. Representatives from over 30 of the 55 signatory countries attended to discuss the implementation of the Accords' principles, including transparency, data sharing, and sustainability in space. In addition, the 2025 Humans to the Moon & Mars Summit (H2M2) was held in Washington, D.C., on May 28-29, bringing together leaders from government, industry, and international space agencies to discuss the future of human space exploration.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The resolution window is the month of June 2025, with the outcome known by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current trend shows new signatories joining at a rate of approximately one per month.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing diplomatic efforts, no country completes its domestic approval process and schedules a signing ceremony within the month of June. This could be due to normal administrative delays or the stochastic nature of international agreements.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the diplomatic momentum from the international space meetings in May 2025, a country that has been in advanced discussions finalizes its decision and formally signs the Accords at a ceremony during June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the consistent growth and recent momentum of the Artemis Accords. With two new signatories in the last two months (Bangladesh in April, Norway in May), the recent rate is approximately one per month. This established trend represents the status quo and suggests a high probability of continuation. The recent international workshops and summits mentioned in the research report, such as the one in Abu Dhabi, often serve as catalysts for such decisions, further increasing the likelihood of a signing in the immediate aftermath. My probability is not higher because the timing of these diplomatic announcements is inherently irregular. There have been previous multi-month gaps between signings, and it is plausible that June could be a quiet month before the next signatory joins. My probability is not lower because the recent rate is a strong positive signal, and the high-profile diplomatic events in May actively worked to build momentum for expansion, making a complete halt in June unlikely. I would increase my forecast upon credible news of a specific country preparing to sign. Conversely, I would decrease it if mid-June passes with no indications of a forthcoming signatory.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025. There are 55 signatories at the time of this question: Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay. [(source)](https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-oceans-and-international-environmental-and-scientific-affairs/artemis-accords)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country becomes an Artemis Accord signatory after May 30, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe United Arab Emirates hosted an international Artemis Accords workshop in Abu Dhabi on May 21-22, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
