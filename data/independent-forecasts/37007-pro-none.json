    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one week. The election is scheduled for April 28, 2025, and results are typically known within a day or two.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The People's National Movement (PNM), as the incumbent party that won the 2020 general election, maintains its political advantage and wins at least a plurality of seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The opposition United National Congress (UNC) successfully mobilizes its base and persuades voters in key marginal constituencies by focusing on public dissatisfaction with crime and the economy. This swing is sufficient for the UNC to win a plurality of seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The PNM leverages its incumbency advantage, running a disciplined campaign that highlights economic stability and national projects. The party successfully defends its marginal seats and holds off the UNC challenge to secure the most seats.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the principle of incumbency advantage in a historically stable two-party system. The People's National Movement (PNM) is the current governing party, having won the last two general elections in 2015 and 2020. The status quo, therefore, favors a PNM victory. Trinidad and Tobago's politics are characterized by tight races between the PNM and the United National Congress (UNC), often decided by a few thousand votes in a handful of marginal constituencies. Given no specific polling data or information suggesting a major political realignment, the most probable outcome is a continuation of the current trend, which is a narrow PNM win. The probability is not higher than 62% because these elections are consistently close, and a small swing in public mood could easily lead to a UNC victory. Public concern over issues like crime or economic performance represents a significant vulnerability for any incumbent government, making an opposition win a very plausible scenario. My forecast is not lower than 62% because overcoming an incumbent's structural advantages (e.g., state resources, media exposure, a proven electoral machine) is a difficult task for an opposition party. Without compelling evidence of a significant anti-incumbent wave, the advantage remains with the PNM. I would increase this forecast with the release of reliable polling showing a consistent PNM lead in key marginals. Conversely, I would decrease the forecast if polls indicated a UNC lead or if a major scandal impacting the PNM government were to emerge before election day.",
