  "information": "According to data from Drought.gov on May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents, representing 73.9% of the state's population, were in drought-affected areas. Reports from late April 2025 indicated that 84% of the state was classified under moderate to extreme drought conditions, a severity level not seen since April 2012. The state has recorded its 12th driest April-to-March period since 1895, and some regions are 6-10 inches below their average rainfall since mid-October 2024.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. As of May 29, 2025, the number of Florida residents in drought is 14.5 million, which is above the 14.0 million threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Florida experiences a wetter-than-average start to its rainy season in June. Widespread, consistent rainfall across populous regions alleviates drought conditions, causing the number of affected residents to fall below 14.0 million by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The onset of the June rainy season is delayed or brings below-average precipitation. The existing severe drought conditions, which are the worst since 2012, persist or worsen, keeping the number of affected residents above the 14.0 million threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored on the current situation, where 14.5 million residents are already in drought-affected areas as of May 29, 2025. This provides a strong basis for a 'Yes' outcome, as the status quo already meets the question's criteria. The drought is severe and widespread, with significant rainfall deficits that will require substantial and sustained precipitation to overcome in just one month.\n\nThe primary factor pushing against this is the timing. The resolution date of June 28 falls within the start of Florida's wet season (late May to October), a period that typically brings significant rainfall and thunderstorm activity. This introduces a high degree of uncertainty, as a particularly wet June could rapidly reduce the number of people in drought conditions.\n\nHowever, my probability remains at 68% for two key reasons. First, reversing a severe drought often takes more than a single month of even average rainfall. Second, the current surplus is 500,000 people over the threshold, meaning conditions only need to remain relatively static for the outcome to be 'Yes'.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the onset of the rainy season is a powerful variable, and an early tropical system or a series of significant storms could dramatically alter the situation, pushing the number below 14.0 million. It is not lower because the starting point is already above the threshold, and overcoming the existing moisture deficit in just 30 days is a significant challenge.\n\nI would update my forecast downwards with evidence of widespread, heavy rainfall in the first few weeks of June or the development of a tropical system projected to impact the state. I would update upwards if long-range forecasts for June show a persistent dry pattern.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to data from Drought.gov on May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents, representing 73.9% of the state's population, were in drought-affected areas.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
