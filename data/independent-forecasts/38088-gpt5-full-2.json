  "information": "As of April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy. As of May 29, 2025, the position was occupied by Vladimir Potanin of Russia.\n\nAnalysis of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index indicates several distribution patterns. U.S. representation is strongest in the top tiers but diminishes at lower rankings. In the 200-300 range, approximately 62% of positions are occupied by non-U.S. billionaires. Over the past year, overall U.S. representation in the top 500 has reportedly declined from 40% to around 35%. Some analyses suggest a seasonal variability, with U.S. billionaires showing stronger representation in the fourth quarter and weaker representation in the first and second quarters.\n\nIn late May 2025, several economic developments were reported. The US Consumer Confidence Index rebounded to a four-year high in May after falling to a five-year low the previous month, an improvement attributed to the temporary suspension of tariffs. US stock indexes, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, rose in anticipation of major tech earnings reports. The EU was given until July 9 to reach a trade deal with the US, a delay that experts considered a positive market signal. A prior 90-day delay in raising import tariffs led to a record $304 billion increase in the combined wealth of the world's richest people, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the 250th rank is currently held by a non-U.S. billionaire (Vladimir Potanin, Russia, as of May 29; previously Giancarlo Devasini, Italy, on Apr 30).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rank 250 remains with, or cycles among, non-U.S. billionaires as ex-U.S. equities/commodities and/or weaker USD support non-U.S. net worths; U.S. representation continues to be thinner in the 200–300 band.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A U.S. billionaire clustered near ranks ~245–255 edges into 250 by July 1 via U.S. equity outperformance, USD strength (denting non-U.S. USD wealth), an IPO/earnings-driven revaluation, or a dip in a current non-U.S. holder.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: In the 200–300 range, about 38% are U.S. per the assistant’s research (62% non-U.S.). That implies a baseline near 38% for a Yes. Current snapshots show non-U.S. holders at 250 on Apr 30 (Italy) and May 29 (Russia), and U.S. share in the top 500 reportedly fell from ~40% to ~35% over the past year. These tilt the odds modestly toward No and justify weighting the status quo more heavily given short lead time and the gradual nature of composition shifts. \nCountervailing factors: Recent U.S. equity strength and a possible stronger USD into early summer could push U.S. names up and non-U.S. down in USD terms; daily list churn around the threshold is common, so a flip remains plausible. I place limited weight on the cited seasonality; even if real, July 1 (start of Q3) is not in the historically weaker Q1–Q2 window. \nWhy not higher: U.S. share around this rank is below 40% and trending lower; the present holder is non-U.S., and persistence over a month is common absent a marked market/FX move. Why not lower: The cluster near rank 250 is dense; small moves, FX shifts, or a single news event can swap the occupant. I would update up if: USD strengthens notably vs. EUR/CNY/RUB; U.S. equities outperform ex-U.S. into late June; or I observe a U.S. name sitting at ~249–251 in the final week of June. I would update down if: ex-U.S. markets/commodities outperform (e.g., nickel rally), USD weakens, or the 250th spot cycles among non-U.S. names through late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked name on the list was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025. It resolves as **No** if the 250th-ranked person is from any other country.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the \"median\" from the question's title is defined as the 250th ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, no matter how many are on the list.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
