    "review": "The other two forecasters presented compelling arguments that have caused me to revise my initial assessment. I found their shared emphasis on the extremely short timeframe and the current government's explicit gradualist platform to be well-founded. Forecaster 2's specific mention of a \"commission with a multi-year mandate\" was a powerful piece of evidence I had not considered; such an institution mechanizes a slow, deliberate process, making a snap announcement in the next two months a direct contradiction of government action. Similarly, Forecaster 3's point about the complete \"lack of public discourse or political maneuvering\" is a crucial piece of negative evidence. A referendum announcement would not occur in a vacuum, and the absence of any preceding discussion strongly indicates that no such move is being planned. Their reasoning has convinced me that I overweighted the potential for recent international events to act as a catalyst and did not sufficiently appreciate the institutional inertia.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downwards from 15% to 5%. My initial reasoning placed too much emphasis on the increased political salience of the independence issue following recent international attention. The deliberation with my colleagues has highlighted stronger, more concrete evidence favoring the 'No' outcome. The Greenlandic government not only won the recent election on a gradualist platform but has also institutionalized this approach by creating a commission with a multi-year mandate for negotiations. This action provides a very strong signal of their long-term intentions and makes an abrupt announcement before July 1 highly improbable. Furthermore, as noted by my colleagues, there is a complete absence of the political and public discussion that would almost certainly precede such a momentous decision. The combination of a fresh electoral mandate for a slow approach, the creation of long-term political machinery, and the lack of any short-term political signaling convinces me that the probability of an announcement is much lower than I first thought. I am lowering my forecast by 10 percentage points to reflect these powerful constraints. The remaining 5% accounts for a low-probability shock event, such as a sudden diplomatic crisis with Denmark or a collapse of the ruling coalition, which could force a sudden change in strategy.",
