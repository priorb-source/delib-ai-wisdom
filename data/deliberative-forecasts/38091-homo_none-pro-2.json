    "review": "The other two forecasters' analyses are highly aligned with my own. We all identified the same primary driver: the recent, consistent rate of new signatories, which establishes a strong trend of approximately one country joining per month. We also all identified the same primary source of uncertainty: the unpredictable timing of diplomatic announcements, which could easily be delayed past the June 30th deadline for logistical or political reasons. Forecaster 3 introduced the concept of a 'bandwagon effect', which is a useful mechanism for explaining why the trend is likely to be robust. Forecaster 2's framing of the status quo as a 'dynamic process of expansion' is an effective counterpoint to a simple no-change baseline. Overall, there is a strong consensus on both the evidence and the reasoning.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I have decided not to change my forecast. Their reasoning strongly reinforces my initial assessment. The consensus view is that the recent trend of signings (one in April, one in May) is the most predictive indicator, making another signing in June more likely than not. The arguments raised by the other forecasters—such as the 'bandwagon effect'—strengthen the rationale for expecting the trend to continue, but they do not introduce new evidence that would warrant a quantitative adjustment. My initial 60% forecast already reflects the balance between this positive momentum and the inherent uncertainty in the precise timing of diplomatic agreements. The analyses of my peers confirm that this is the correct balance of factors to consider, solidifying my confidence in my original probability estimate.",
