    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~6 months (election expected by Oct 20, 2025; result known on election night)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — current polling and seat models imply Liberals well below the 172-seat majority threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Conservatives maintain a national lead of ~10–20 points into the campaign; Liberals lose ground in Ontario suburbs and Atlantic Canada, fail to recover in the Prairies, and face Bloc resilience in Quebec. Result: CPC majority or strong plurality; Liberals in the ~70–120 seat range, clearly under 172.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A dramatic late reversal: either (a) a leadership change that materially improves Liberal vote efficiency plus a CPC campaign stumble/scandal, or (b) a sharp economic/issue-driven swing that lifts Liberal national vote to ~39–41% with strong overperformance in GTA/905, Atlantic Canada, competitive gains in Quebec against the Bloc, and pickups in BC’s Lower Mainland—enough to reach 172+ seats in a 343-seat House.",
    "rationale": "The House will have 343 seats in 2025, so a majority is 172. As of April 2025, the public polling trajectory since 2023 shows sustained double‑digit Conservative leads and Liberal support in the mid‑20s, with unfavorable PM approval. Seat models like 338Canada have for months translated those polls into a likely CPC majority and a Liberal seat total far below even minority territory. To get to 172+, the Liberals would need an historically large swing: roughly a 10–15 point improvement in national vote share from current levels, highly efficient distribution in Ontario/Atlantic Canada, a meaningful rebound in Quebec despite the Bloc, and minimized losses to the NDP in urban cores. That is possible but very unlikely without a major shock (leadership change, opponent implosion, or extraordinary economic/policy reversal). The world changes slowly; thus the status quo (CPC well ahead, Liberal fatigue) deserves heavy weight. Why not higher: the structural map is unfavorable—Ontario suburbs and Atlantic Canada that powered past Liberal majorities currently lean away; Bloc and NDP constrain Liberal upside even if CPC softens. Why not lower: Canadian campaigns can move votes materially (e.g., 2015), and tail risks exist (leadership or scandal dynamics) that could compress the race quickly. What would move me up: sustained (4–6 weeks) national polls putting Liberals near 38–40%, clear 338Canada projections with Liberal median ≥160 seats, a leadership transition accompanied by a double‑digit favorability swing, or a major CPC error that measurably flips Ontario/Atlantic battlegrounds. What would move me down: continued CPC 10–20 point lead into late summer, further Liberal fundraising/candidate‑retirement signals, or Quebec polling showing Bloc gains. Research assistant provided no additional information beyond this context.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Liberal Party win 172 or more seats in the 2025 Canadian federal election?\n\nQuestion background:\n[338Canada Federal Projection](https://338canada.com/federal.htm): \"The 338Canada project is a statistical model of electoral projections based on opinion polls, electoral history, and demographic data. This web site is a creation of Philippe J. Fournier, physics and astrophysics professor at Cégep de Saint-Laurent in Montreal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Liberal Party of Canada wins greater than or equal to 172 seats in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
