    "no_outcome_scenario": "Muqtada al-Sadr continues his boycott of the formal Iraqi political process, believing it to be irredeemably corrupt. He maintains his influence through his large grassroots following and the threat of street protests, calculating that remaining outside the system preserves his credibility as an opposition figure more effectively than parliamentary participation would.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a characteristic political reversal, Sadr perceives a critical threat from his political rivals in the Coordination Framework solidifying their control over the state. To counter this, and perhaps after securing key concessions, he announces his movement's return to the electoral process to mobilize his base and re-assert his influence within formal government institutions.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored in the current and persistent status quo. Muqtada al-Sadr's movement withdrew from parliament in 2022 and has since maintained a consistent public stance of boycotting the electoral process, as highlighted by recent reporting. This is a strong baseline, as political positions of this magnitude are not easily reversed without significant cause.\n\nThe primary reason for my forecast being heavily skewed towards 'No' is this inertia and Sadr's stated position. He has framed the boycott as a principled stand against corruption, and reversing course without a clear political victory would risk damaging his credibility with his followers. With less than two months until the deadline, the window for the kind of major political realignment or concession that would precipitate his return is closing rapidly.\n\nHowever, the probability is not lower than 20% due to Muqtada al-Sadr's well-documented history of political unpredictability and dramatic reversals. He could calculate that a continued boycott would allow his rivals to consolidate power to a dangerous degree, making participation a strategic necessity. The stakes of the 2025 election are high, and Sadr may decide at the last minute that being inside the tent, even a flawed one, is better than being outside. This 'wild card' factor is the main driver for a non-trivial chance of a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nMy probability is not higher because there is currently no public evidence—such as reports of back-channel negotiations or a softening of his rhetoric—to suggest such a reversal is imminent. The default path is the continuation of his current policy.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of negotiations between the Sadrists and other major factions, or if a significant national crisis occurred that Sadr could use as a pretext to re-enter the political process as a 'savior'. I would decrease my forecast if Sadr issues another strong, unequivocal statement reaffirming the boycott closer to the deadline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Muqtada al-Sadr's Alliance Towards Reforms party announce that it will participate in the 2025 Iraqi parliamentary election?\n\nQuestion background:\nbasnews: [Sadr Rejects Iraqi President’s Plea, Reaffirms Election Boycott](https://www.basnews.com/en/babat/881132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the Alliance Towards Reforms announces that it will field candidates in Iraq's [2025 parliamentary elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Iraqi_parliamentary_election).\n\n\"Alliance Towards Reforms\" refers to the \"**تحالف سائرون للإصلا**ح\" or \"سائرون\" coalition, party or movement headed by Muqtada al-Sadr, as decribed at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Towards_Reforms). Name changes will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
