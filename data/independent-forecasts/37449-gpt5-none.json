    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China continues gray-zone pressure—air and naval sorties, temporary exercise or exclusion zones, selective maritime inspections near outer islands—without physically preventing access to a Taiwan main-island seaport; the U.S. condemns coercion but avoids the legally loaded term “blockade.”",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The PLA/China Coast Guard establishes and enforces a “maritime traffic control/inspection” or exercise zone that effectively stops commercial vessels from entering or leaving a named Taiwan port (e.g., Kaohsiung or Keelung) for a sustained period, prompting an on-record U.S. government statement (White House, State, or DoD) that China is “blockading” that port (including language such as “de facto blockade”).",
    "rationale": "- Base rate and incentives: A formal blockade of a Taiwan port would be a major escalatory move with high risk of U.S. and allied military countermeasures. Beijing has preferred reversible, plausibly deniable pressure. Washington tends to use careful language (“coercion,” “intimidation,” “maritime exclusion zones”) and avoids declaring a “blockade” unless the facts clearly meet that threshold, because the term carries significant legal and deterrence implications.\n- Short time window: With less than two months remaining, a first-time port blockade plus a U.S. accusation must both occur. That compresses the odds further.\n- Recent pattern: Past crises (e.g., large-scale PLA exercises encircling Taiwan) disrupted traffic but stopped short of an actual port blockade, and U.S. officials did not label them as such. Actions around Kinmen/Matsu have been coercive but not described by the U.S. government as a blockade of a Taiwan seaport.\n- Why not higher: A blockade would be an extraordinary step likely to trigger a major international response; the U.S. is cautious about invoking the term. The status quo favors gray-zone tactics short of blockade.\n- Why not lower: Tail risks remain. Beijing could time coercive moves around political or military milestones and test a port “inspection” regime that effectively halts traffic. If that happened, U.S. rhetoric could sharpen to “de facto blockade,” satisfying resolution criteria.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of China announcing/enforcing maritime control or inspection zones that impede access to a named Taiwan port; AIS/shipping data showing diversions or turnaways at that port; satellite or media evidence of port approaches being interdicted; U.S. messaging hardening toward “blockade” language in briefings.\n- What would move me down: Continued routine PLA activity and exercises with no port-targeted interdictions; explicit U.S. avoidance of blockade terminology even amid heightened drills; signals from Beijing emphasizing de-escalation or focus on other theaters.\n- Research assistant info: No new developments provided, consistent with low-probability, status-quo assessment.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of blockading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWSJ via MSN: [China Is Ready to Blockade Taiwan. Here’s How.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/china-is-ready-to-blockade-taiwan-here-s-how/ar-AA1BvnW8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of blockading at least one of Taiwan's seaports without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
