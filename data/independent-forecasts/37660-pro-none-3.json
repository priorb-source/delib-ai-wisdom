    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "45 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The process towards service launch began with the license approval in August 2024. The continuation of this process without major interruptions would result in availability before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Logistical delays in establishing ground infrastructure, navigating final local regulations, or a strategic decision by Starlink to prioritize other global markets pushes the official launch and website update to after the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the key regulatory license approval in August 2024, Starlink successfully completes its technical and logistical preparations, including ground station deployment, and officially launches service in Sri Lanka, updating its availability map to 'Available' an a date prior to July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The foundation for this forecast is the public announcement from August 2024 that Sri Lanka's regulator granted Starlink a license to operate. This is the most significant hurdle for entering a new market. With approximately 11 months between that approval and the July 1, 2025 deadline, there has been a substantial window for Starlink, a company known for its rapid execution, to complete the necessary preparations for launch. The status quo is not one of inaction, but of progress towards launch initiated by that license grant. Therefore, a 'Yes' outcome is the more likely scenario.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 75% because there is no public information confirming the completion of critical next steps, such as the deployment of local ground stations (gateways) or the specific timeline for the service going live. The launch could be dependent on infrastructure in neighboring countries like India, where regulatory approval is not yet finalized. Unforeseen logistical or minor bureaucratic delays are common in such rollouts and could easily push the activation date by a few weeks, past the deadline.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 75% because the primary obstacle has been cleared for over nine months. A failure to launch within an 11-month timeframe post-licensing would suggest a significant and unexpected issue has arisen, or that Starlink's deployment timeline is much slower than typically observed, neither of which is supported by current evidence. The commercial incentive is to launch and begin generating revenue as soon as is operationally feasible.\n\nI would increase my probability with news confirming the completion of ground station construction in Sri Lanka, or an official announcement from Starlink or the Sri Lankan government of a launch in Q2 2025. I would decrease my probability if reports emerged of new regulatory challenges or if Starlink's own map updated the timeline for Sri Lanka to a later date, such as 'Q3 2025'.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Sri Lanka as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Musk's Starlink wins Sri Lanka licence](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/sri-lanka-regulator-grants-licence-musks-starlink-satellite-broadband-2024-08-13/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Sri Lanka listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
