    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in broad agreement on the core dynamics: the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system is a formidable structural barrier for Reform UK, and the historical precedent set by UKIP's peak performance (17 seats) suggests a high bar for success. I found Forecaster 3's analysis particularly compelling. Two of their points stood out: first, the critical insight that a Conservative vote collapse will not solely benefit Reform, but will be fragmented across Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and Greens, potentially allowing Conservatives to retain seats with low pluralities. Second, their skeptical assessment of the single Electoral Calculus poll, framing it as a potential outlier given the unproven nature of local MRP modeling, is a prudent check on over-interpreting one data point. Forecaster 2's point about the short time remaining until the election also reinforces the case for the status quo being difficult to overturn.",
    "rationale": "After considering the other analyses, I am revising my forecast downward significantly from 25% to 15%. My initial forecast placed too much weight on the Electoral Calculus poll predicting a Reform win. The deliberation has convinced me of the need to more heavily weight the fundamental structural barriers that both other forecasters emphasized. Forecaster 3's argument about the anti-Conservative vote splitting among multiple parties is crucial; this dynamic makes it far more difficult for Reform to achieve the sweeping number of pluralities needed to become the largest party, even with a high overall vote share. I now view the EC poll less as a direct prediction and more as an indicator of a high-volatility environment and a significant, but likely overestimated, upside risk for Reform. Moving to 15% reflects my revised belief that while the structural and historical evidence points strongly to a 'No' outcome, the confluence of deep Conservative unpopularity and Reform's high national polling makes a shocking upset a non-trivial, though highly improbable, tail risk. I am not lowering my forecast to the single digits because a single reputable poll predicting such a specific, dramatic outcome cannot be dismissed entirely.",
