    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides critical hard data I lacked: March 2025 inflation was exactly 2.2% (down from 2.3% in February), and the Bloomberg/Reuters consensus for April is 2.1%. This fundamentally changes the analysis - we're not speculating about distant data, we have very recent context and expert consensus. Forecaster 3 raises an important technical point about rounding (need 2.3%+ displayed to resolve Yes) and highlights the late Easter timing effect on services prices, which is a legitimate upside risk I underweighted. However, Forecaster 3's claim that readings have 'generally been above 2.2%' contradicts Forecaster 2's data showing March at exactly 2.2% with a downward trend. The key tension: Forecaster 2's consensus-based 30% versus Forecaster 3's Easter-effect-driven 64%. I find Forecaster 2's analysis more compelling because it anchors on concrete consensus forecasts (2.1%) rather than speculative seasonal effects. To resolve Yes requires beating consensus by 0.2 percentage points - possible but not the base case. Forecaster 3's rounding insight is valuable but cuts both ways: 2.25% would show as 2.2% and resolve No, making the effective threshold higher.",
    "rationale": "My initial 18% was too low given the new information. March's 2.2% reading means we're right at the threshold, not well below it as I assumed. The Easter timing effect on services (travel, hospitality) that Forecaster 3 identifies is a real upside risk I hadn't adequately considered. However, the consensus forecast of 2.1% is decisive evidence - for Yes to occur, April would need to beat consensus by 0.2 percentage points to reach the 2.3% display threshold. This is possible but represents a tail scenario, not the base case. The disinflationary forces I outlined remain valid: weak PMI readings, decelerating wages, soft demand. Forecaster 2's 30% probability better reflects the balance of risks: meaningful upside possibility from Easter effects and services stickiness, but consensus and trend favor a reading at or below 2.2%. I'm updating from 18% to 30% - higher due to the proximity of March's reading to the threshold and seasonal risks, but not as high as 64% because consensus forecasts have proven reliable and the disinflationary trend remains intact.",
