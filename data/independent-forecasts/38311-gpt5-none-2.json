    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–3 weeks (the G7 Leaders’ Summit is scheduled for June 2025; exact mid/late-June dates).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — he attends in person.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A last-minute cancellation due to an acute domestic or international crisis, a health issue, or a deliberate boycott/substitution (sending the Vice President or Secretary of State instead), or an unexpected postponement of the summit.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He travels to Canada and appears in person at the leaders’ summit venue (e.g., plenary/photo ops/bilaterals), physically present with other heads of state.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: The White House has already confirmed he will visit Canada for the G7. Historically, sitting U.S. presidents almost always attend G7 summits; Trump himself attended prior G7s (2017, 2018, 2019), even when relations were strained, suggesting a strong status-quo pull toward attendance. Canada is nearby, lowering travel/logistical risks. Cancelling would incur diplomatic and political costs. Given the short lead time (mid/late June) and official confirmation, the default is attendance. \n- Why not higher: Residual risks remain, especially with an unpredictable principal: sudden domestic crises, health issues, security concerns, or a tactical decision to snub or send a surrogate. While unlikely, such events are non-negligible over a 2–3 week horizon. \n- What would raise the forecast: Firm, detailed schedule releases close to the date, pool reports of wheels-up, arrival notices from Canadian hosts, or photographic evidence of arrival at the venue. \n- What would lower the forecast: Credible reporting of illness, a major domestic emergency, indications of a boycott, or official guidance that a senior surrogate will lead the delegation. \n- Research assistant input: No additional information beyond the White House confirmation; this supports a status-quo expectation of attendance.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCTV: [Donald Trump will visit Canada for G7, White House confirms](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/article/white-house-confirms-trump-will-visit-canada-for-g7-leaders-summit/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
