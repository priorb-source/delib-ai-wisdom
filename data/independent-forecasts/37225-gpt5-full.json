  "information": "The most recent poll, conducted on April 22, 2025, projects the Progressive Reform Party (VHP) winning 29% of seats, the National Democratic Party (NDP) 24%, and the National Party of Suriname (NPS) 14%. An earlier poll from January 2025 showed the NDP at 54% and the VHP at 29%. The incumbent VHP, led by President Chandrikapersad Santokhi, aims to secure at least 26 of the 51 available seats in the National Assembly. The opposition NDP has publicly ruled out any post-election collaboration with the VHP.\n\nPositive economic factors for the incumbent VHP government include a reduction in inflation from 60% to 10%, compliance with an IMF program, and the signing of a Final Investment Decision with TotalEnergies for the Granmorgu oil field. The government also instituted a 15% salary increase for government employees and pensioners in 2024, with an additional 5% in January 2025. Conversely, negative factors include high public dissatisfaction, with 56% of the public dissatisfied with the current government and 66% believing the country is worse off than five years prior. The country faces persistent poverty and a $4 billion national debt. One report cited President Santokhi's approval rating at approximately 3%.\n\nThe general election is scheduled for May 25, 2025. A significant change in the electoral process is the shift to a National Proportional Representation system, which replaces the previous district-based system and will be used for the first time. The opposition is described as fragmented. The NDP is facing challenges after the death of former leader Desi Bouterse. Some smaller parties, including the Sociaal Democratische Unie (SDU), Permanente Voorspoed Republiek Suriname (PVRS), and De Nieuwe Wind (DNW), have formed an alliance to run together under the SDU banner.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 27 days until election day (May 25, 2025), with preliminary seat totals likely within 1–3 days afterward.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "VHP (Progressive Reform Party) wins a narrow plurality of seats under the new national PR system.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Late break toward the NDP (or another large party) driven by anti‑incumbent sentiment and turnout, or effective opposition coordination/alliance, results in VHP finishing second (or tied for first, which would still resolve as No).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Opposition remains fragmented and the NDP underperforms post‑Bouterse; with improving macro indicators and incumbency advantages, VHP holds a mid‑to‑high‑20s vote share that translates to the largest seat count by a slim margin.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: The latest available poll (Apr 22, 2025) has VHP projected at 29% of seats, ahead of NDP at 24% and NPS at 14%. An earlier January poll had NDP at 54% and VHP at 29%, implying substantial volatility or methodological differences. Public mood is negative toward the government (56% dissatisfied; 66% say the country is worse off), and one report pegs President Santokhi’s approval near 3% (if accurate, very poor). Positives for the incumbent include inflation falling from ~60% to ~10%, IMF program compliance, a TotalEnergies FID for the Granmorgu oil field, and public‑sector pay increases. The NDP reportedly faces leadership/headwinds after Desi Bouterse’s death and has ruled out post‑election cooperation with VHP. The election will, for the first time, use national proportional representation instead of the old district system. Some small parties are allied under SDU, but the broader opposition remains fragmented.\n- Interpreting this: Under national PR, the largest party’s seat share should map roughly to its vote share, and fragmentation makes a low‑30s or even high‑20s plurality plausible. The electoral reform likely reduces the old system’s geographic distortions that historically could advantage parties with strong interior/district bases; this could slightly favor VHP relative to NDP. The April poll placing VHP first is consistent with a fragmented opposition landscape.\n- Why not higher: Headline public dissatisfaction, austerity fatigue from IMF measures, and very low leader approval (if reliable) are significant headwinds. Polling in Suriname is sparse and potentially low‑quality; the January–April swing highlights uncertainty. New electoral rules add model risk, and a tie for most seats would resolve as No. A late pro‑NDP swing or better opposition coordination could easily push VHP to second place.\n- Why not lower: The most recent poll shows VHP ahead; incumbency typically ensures strong baseline recognition and resources. Opposition fragmentation and NDP’s adjustment to post‑Bouterse leadership reduce the likelihood of a unified anti‑VHP plurality. Macro stabilization (inflation down, oil FID) and public‑sector raises could blunt some anti‑incumbent sentiment enough for VHP to remain first even if far from a majority.\n- What would move me: Upward if multiple independent polls show VHP leading, if opposition parties fail to coordinate lists, or if credible seat simulations under the PR formula systematically award the top party an edge. Downward if reputable polling puts NDP (or another party) ahead, if a significant opposition alliance forms that consolidates votes, or if new scandals/economic shocks drive late defections from VHP. Clarification of any formal threshold or allocation quirks that disadvantage the largest party would also move me down.",
