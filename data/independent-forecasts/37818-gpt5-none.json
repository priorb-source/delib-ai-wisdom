    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (resolution checked on/after July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Pilot reports for June are sparse and dispersed: Florida has 0–1, or ties at 1 with other states, or a high-traffic state like California, Texas, Arizona, Nevada, or New York has the most.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Florida uniquely tops the month—e.g., it logs 3+ pilot reports while every other state has fewer (≤2), perhaps driven by multiple coastal/nighttime events or misidentified launch/space activity visible to pilots over Florida.",
    "rationale": "Note: The prompt headline mentions March 2025, but the stated resolution criterion specifies June 2025; I forecast to the written criterion (June 2025, as posted by NUFORC and checked on/after July 1, 2025). Base rate: NUFORC pilot reports per month are typically few, with counts concentrated in a handful of high-aviation states. Florida is consistently among the top states by aviation activity and general NUFORC reports, and has features that could boost pilot sightings (dense GA/airline traffic, flight training, coastal routes, frequent night operations, and occasional rocket launches from the Cape). However, low monthly counts make ties common; ties resolve No, which materially depresses the chance of a Yes. Competition from California and Texas (and at times AZ/NV/NY) is strong, and any single cluster elsewhere can easily outpace Florida in a given month. Status quo thus leans No: either a tie at a low count (e.g., 1 each across several states) or another large state leads. Why not higher: tie penalty plus strong rivals and inherently low monthly totals. Why not lower: Florida’s structural advantages—very high flight volume and sky visibility—put it near the top contenders in most months, so a unique-leader outcome is plausible. Upward updates: early indications of multiple June pilot reports in Florida; high-visibility events over Florida (e.g., bright reentries/launches) that generate pilot reports; NUFORC/social chatter hinting at Florida pilot clusters. Downward updates: visible clusters in California/Texas (or others), or a quiet month for Florida’s pilot category. Research assistant provided no additional data; this forecast relies on base rates and qualitative priors about NUFORC pilot-report distributions and Florida’s aviation context.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
