  "information": "On January 1, 2025, a pilot report was logged in the NUFORC database describing a sighting of a four-craft inline formation of UFOs in Rwanda. Additionally, a separate, non-pilot sighting of a glowing sphere was reported over Cape Town, South Africa, on January 22, 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months. The resolution window is the month of June 2025, and the outcome will be checked on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Pilot reports of UFOs from Africa posted on NUFORC are historically rare. The status quo is that in any given month, no such report will be posted.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "During the month of June 2025, no pilots flying over Africa report a UFO/UAP sighting to NUFORC, or if a report is made, it is not processed and posted on the NUFORC website by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial, military, or private pilot observes an unusual aerial phenomenon while flying over a country in Africa during June 2025. They submit a report to NUFORC, which is then published on its website and is visible on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the low base rate of this specific event, tempered by recent, relevant evidence. Historically, pilot reports of UFOs from the African continent are infrequent compared to those from North America. The criteria are highly specific: it must be a pilot report, occur in Africa, happen within a one-month window (June 2025), and be reported to and posted by a specific organization (NUFORC). This combination makes the event inherently unlikely, favoring a 'No' outcome.\n\nHowever, the information provided by my research assistant is critical. The fact that a pilot report from Rwanda was logged by NUFORC for a January 1, 2025 sighting is a powerful piece of evidence. It confirms that the entire event chain—from sighting by a pilot in Africa to successful submission and posting on NUFORC—is not only possible but has occurred very recently. This single data point significantly elevates the probability from near-zero.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because a single report, while important, does not establish a trend. It could easily be an outlier. Without a series of such reports over the preceding months, it is difficult to justify a belief that they have become a common occurrence. The status quo of rarity remains the dominant factor.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because ignoring the January 2025 precedent would be a mistake. It provides a concrete anchor demonstrating feasibility. A probability below 10% would understate the significance of this recent, directly comparable event.\n\nTo update my forecast higher, I would need to see evidence of a 'flap' or cluster of reports from the region in the months leading up to June 2025. To update lower, I would need information suggesting the January report was anomalous, or that NUFORC's posting delays for international reports are typically longer than a few weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn January 1, 2025, a pilot report was logged in the NUFORC database describing a sighting of a four-craft inline formation of UFOs in Rwanda. Additionally, a separate, non-pilot sighting of a glowing sphere was reported over Cape Town, South Africa, on January 22, 2025.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
