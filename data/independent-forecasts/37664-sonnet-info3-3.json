    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks (46 days) until the July 1, 2025 resolution date",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Claude 4 has not been released to the general public and continues to be unavailable",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic does not complete development and safety testing in time, or releases Claude 4 in a limited beta/waitlist format, or delays the release until after July 1, 2025 as suggested by reports indicating 'later in 2025'",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic surprises the market with a rapid launch announcement in late May or June, completing all necessary preparations and making Claude 4 immediately available to the general public without waitlist requirements before July 1",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No resolution. As of mid-May 2025, there have been no announcements of an imminent Claude 4 launch. The research assistant's report indicates that multiple sources from February and March 2025 frame the release as expected 'later in 2025', which typically refers to the second half of the year (July onwards, after our resolution date). With only 6.5 weeks remaining, a major AI model launch would typically require: (1) advance announcement weeks ahead, (2) infrastructure preparation, (3) safety and testing completion, and (4) often a phased rollout starting with waitlist/early access before general availability. The question specifically requires general public access without waitlist, making the bar higher. Major model releases rarely happen as surprise launches without advance marketing. The February report about Claude 4 being a hybrid model suggests sophisticated architecture that would require extensive testing. Why not lower (than 18%): Six weeks is still enough time technically for a launch, companies occasionally do surprise releases, and development is presumably well advanced given we're already in 2025. Why not higher: No announcements yet, industry pattern suggests later release, 'later in 2025' language in reports, and insufficient time for typical launch patterns. I would update higher with any official announcement of a pre-July launch date or credible leaks. I would update lower if more time passes without news or if Anthropic officially indicates a post-July timeline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA February 2025 report from Sina Finance described plans for Claude 4 to be a hybrid model combining a general-purpose model with a reasoning model, which would allow users to adjust the computational resources used for a given task.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
