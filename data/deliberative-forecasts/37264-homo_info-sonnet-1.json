    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that have caused me to reconsider my initial assessment. Forecaster 2 raises a critical point I hadn't fully weighted: the advisory hasn't been updated since March 2023, before the July 2023 coup, yet it remains at Level 3. This 2+ year stability despite a major coup actually strengthens the status quo case significantly. Forecaster 3's South Sudan precedent (March 2025 upgrade following ordered departure) is instructive - it shows Level 4 changes require acute triggers like personnel evacuations, not just persistent poor conditions. Both forecasters correctly emphasize that the existing security concerns are likely already priced into Niger's current Level 3 status. Forecaster 2's point about existing regional Level 4 designations within Niger (Diffa, Lake Chad basin, Mali border) is interesting - this suggests the State Department can and does contain extreme risk assessments to specific areas rather than upgrading the entire country. The consensus around 18-20% from the other forecasters, versus my 28%, suggests I may have underweighted bureaucratic inertia. Their reasoning about status quo persistence despite ample historical reasons to escalate is sound.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm revising downward from 28% to 22%. The key factors driving this revision are: (1) The remarkable persistence of Level 3 status through the July 2023 coup and 2+ years of ongoing instability demonstrates stronger bureaucratic inertia than I initially credited; (2) The South Sudan example reinforces that upgrades need acute triggers (ordered evacuations, attacks on Americans) rather than ongoing poor conditions that are already reflected in current advisory levels; (3) Both forecasters correctly note that the 2-month timeframe compounds the status quo advantage. However, I'm not going as low as 18% because: (1) The regional security environment remains genuinely volatile with Mali and Burkina Faso already at Level 4; (2) Active terrorist groups operate in the region making an acute incident plausible within 2 months; (3) The outdated advisory (if truly not reviewed since March 2023) could mean a comprehensive review is overdue, though this cuts both ways. My updated 22% reflects stronger weight on status quo persistence while acknowledging non-trivial tail risk from the volatile security environment.",
