    "review": "Both forecasters converge on the same core drivers I used: short window to July 1, a workable SNS-led majority that can install a new PM without elections, and Serbia’s snap-election propensity keeping odds non-trivial. The most useful refinement is their emphasis on announcement lead times: Serbian snap polls are typically decreed 6–10 weeks before voting, which implies that any announcement before July 1 would likely schedule a mid-July to late-August vote—an unattractive summer window. That strengthens the case for “No” in this timeframe. Neither added concrete evidence of coalition fracture or presidential intent to dissolve, so there’s no reason to move upward.",
    "rationale": "With ~46 days left, a pre–July 1 announcement would almost certainly set an election date in mid-July to late August, given legal/operational lead times. Summer timing is politically suboptimal, reducing the incentive to call elections now. The SNS-led bloc appears capable of installing a replacement PM, and constitutional processes after a resignation can stretch beyond July 1 before forcing dissolution. While Serbia’s leadership has a history of using snap polls and the PM resignation raises hazard, there are no public signals pointing to imminent dissolution or a decree. Taken together, the narrow window and summer disincentive nudge the probability slightly lower than my initial take.",
