    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6-7 weeks. The US Census Bureau typically releases monthly trade data about 6-8 weeks after month end, so April 2025 data should be published in early-to-mid June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo would be NO. The threshold of $262,578 million appears to represent April 2024 export levels. With Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs mentioned in the context, this suggests significant new trade barriers have been implemented. Historically, major tariff actions and resulting trade tensions tend to suppress rather than boost exports due to retaliatory measures from trading partners.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "US exports remain flat or decline compared to April 2024 due to: (1) retaliatory tariffs from trading partners reducing demand for US goods, (2) trade policy uncertainty causing businesses to delay export orders, (3) a stronger dollar (often associated with trade tensions) making US goods less competitive globally, and (4) disrupted supply chains affecting export-oriented manufacturers.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "US exports exceed April 2024 levels because: (1) foreign buyers rush to purchase US goods before anticipated retaliatory measures fully take effect, creating a temporary surge, (2) the dollar weakens significantly, making US exports more competitive, (3) strong global economic growth offsets tariff impacts in key sectors, or (4) the tariffs primarily affect imports while major export sectors remain relatively unaffected.",
    "rationale": "The key challenge is that major tariff implementations typically create headwinds for bilateral trade flows. The reference to 'liberation day' tariffs suggests a significant trade policy shift that would likely prompt retaliation from US trading partners, directly harming US export competitiveness. However, several factors create uncertainty: First, we're measuring nominal dollar values, so even modest inflation or currency movements could push exports slightly higher despite volume declines. Second, the timing matters - April 2025 might capture anticipatory effects or be too early for full impact. Third, without specific data on January-March 2025 export trends, I cannot assess momentum. Historical patterns show US exports have grown roughly 3-7% annually in normal years, but trade war periods (like 2018-2019) saw flat or declining exports. The lack of information from the research assistant means I'm forecasting blind on recent trends. Given trade policy headwinds but acknowledging uncertainty about magnitude, timing, and offsetting factors, I assess roughly 35% probability that April 2025 exports will exceed the April 2024 baseline. This forecast would increase if: early 2025 data showed strong export momentum, the dollar weakened substantially, or tariff impacts proved less severe than typical trade wars. It would decrease if: retaliatory measures were swift and comprehensive, or if preliminary 2025 data showed export weakness.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US exports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of exports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 262,578 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
