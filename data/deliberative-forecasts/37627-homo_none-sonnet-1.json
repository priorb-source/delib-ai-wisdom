    "review": "The convergence around 60-65% across all three forecasters is notable and suggests this range appropriately captures the uncertainty. Key shared insights include: the active war creates regular communication needs, Trump's unconventional diplomatic approach introduces uncertainty, the 33-day window is substantial, and alternative communication channels exist. Forecaster 3's emphasis on base rates is valuable - if US presidents typically communicate monthly with critical allies during active conflicts, this supports the higher end of our range. However, I note we all share a significant blind spot: none of us have information about recent communication patterns or whether a call already occurred on May 12 (the first qualifying day). This is now day 2 of the resolution period. The mutual acknowledgment requirement, while mentioned by all, seems like a minor rather than major friction point - strategic reasons for non-acknowledgment seem unlikely between these particular leaders on this topic. One consideration not fully explored: the definition specifies 'telephone or equivalent device' with specific technical requirements, which should include modern telecommunications but the precision of this definition doesn't materially change the forecast. The lack of information about upcoming diplomatic events (summits, meetings) that could either substitute for or necessitate calls remains a gap in our analysis.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I find the collective reasoning sound and my initial assessment well-calibrated. The 60-65% range represents appropriate confidence given: (1) Strong base rate expectation of monthly contact during active conflicts involving major US interests; (2) Trump's documented willingness to engage directly with world leaders when it serves his interests, particularly around his stated goal of ending the Ukraine war; (3) The substantial 33-day window making complete avoidance unlikely; (4) However, genuine uncertainty from Trump's unconventional style, possible preference for intermediaries or alternative formats, and the historically complex Trump-Zelenskyy relationship. The convergence of independent forecasts in this narrow range validates rather than challenges my reasoning. I'm not updating higher because the Trump factor and lack of current information prevent higher confidence. I'm not updating lower because the geopolitical stakes, time window, and diplomatic base rates make a call more likely than not. My forecast remains at 65%.",
