    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my base-rate reasoning and timeline logic. Forecaster 2 added a useful point about The Hague/ICC being a non-issue for a sitting U.S. president, which removes a hypothetical downside tail I hadn’t explicitly addressed. Both emphasized that weeks out from the event, attendance is the status quo path and that skipping would be unusually costly—points I agree with. Their update triggers (official White House guidance, pooled press logistics, or credible reports of a surrogate/skip) mirror mine. I find their arguments credible and slightly strengthening of the attendance case.",
    "rationale": "I previously set 78% based on strong historical precedent, Trump’s prior NATO attendance, and the high platform value for his agenda, haircutted for his norm-breaking tendencies and late-stage volatility. After reviewing the others: (1) the ICC/Hague concern is negligible for a U.S. president, trimming a small downside tail; (2) proximity to the summit without contrary reporting increases the weight on the status quo plan; (3) incentives remain strongly pro-attendance. I still reserve non-trivial probability for a last-minute snub, delegation to VP/State, or an acute domestic/international disruption, and for the edge case of a date shift out of June. On balance, I move up modestly to reflect reinforced likelihoods, but keep room for Trump-specific unpredictability.",
