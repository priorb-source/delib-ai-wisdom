    "no_outcome_scenario": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia remains in El Salvador. Any legal petitions for his re-entry, if active, are not adjudicated within the two-month timeframe. He does not attempt or does not succeed in re-entering the United States without authorization before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Due to a significant and unforeseen change in his family's circumstances or a successful high-profile advocacy campaign, he is granted a rare and expedited form of entry like humanitarian parole. Alternatively, he successfully enters the United States without authorization, and his presence is verified by a credible source.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the significant legal and bureaucratic barriers to re-entry for a deported individual, especially within the very short two-month timeframe. The status quo is that Mr. Abrego Garcia is in El Salvador and legally barred from returning to the US following his 2018 deportation. For a legal return, he would require an immigrant visa and likely a waiver of inadmissibility due to his prior criminal convictions. These processes are notoriously slow, with standard processing times measured in many months or years, not weeks. The two months remaining before the resolution date is an insufficient period for these legal pathways to be completed under normal circumstances. The research assistant's report of 'no additional information' indicates there is no publicly known evidence that his case is being expedited or that any special circumstances have arisen. While an unauthorized entry is a possibility given his strong family ties in the United States, it is a perilous undertaking with a low probability of success that also meets the 'credible source' reporting criteria within the specific timeframe. My probability is not lower than 2% because there remains a small chance of a non-standard event, such as a successful unauthorized entry or a 'black swan' event like a sudden grant of humanitarian parole, perhaps spurred by political intervention from his past high-profile supporters. My probability is not higher because of the immense inertia of the US immigration system and the lack of any positive indicators for his case. I would increase my forecast if credible news emerged about a scheduled visa interview, an approved waiver, or a significant political or public campaign advocating for his immediate return. Conversely, I would lower it if reports confirmed he had no immediate plans to attempt a return.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kilmar Abrego Garcia return to the United States before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Kilmar_Abrego_Garcia)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kilmar Abrego Garcia after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of the United States according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nSubsequently leaving the United States, such as a deportation, will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
