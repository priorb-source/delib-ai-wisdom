    "review": "Both forecasters provide thoughtful analyses with converging evidence but divergent conclusions. Forecaster 2's 5% and Forecaster 3's 12% bracket my initial 8%, all based on the same core factors: absence of visible preparations, tight scheduling windows, and Trump's unpredictability.\n\nForecaster 3 raises a particularly compelling point I hadn't fully weighted: the tariff deadline of July 9 actually creates pressure for an EARLY July meeting rather than late June. If leaders are racing to finalize before tariffs snap back on July 8, meeting on July 2-5 would be logistically easier and still achieve the objective. This shifts the modal meeting date OUT of the resolution window, which should lower my forecast.\n\nForecaster 3's higher 12% seems somewhat inconsistent with their own tariff-timing argument. They acknowledge this deadline 'slightly biases the modal meeting date to early July rather than late June,' yet maintain the highest forecast. The mention of 'short stopover' possibilities doesn't overcome the fundamental preparation requirements.\n\nForecaster 2's emphasis on the 'single most critical factor' of absent preparations aligns with historical precedent. Their 5% appropriately weights the overwhelming logistical barriers while preserving some probability for Trump's unconventional decision-making.\n\nBoth forecasters reinforce what I already identified but Forecaster 3's tariff-timing insight is genuinely new and important. It suggests that even IF a Trump-Xi meeting happens soon, the path of least resistance is early July, not late June.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast downward based primarily on the tariff deadline analysis. The July 9 deadline for tariffs to snap back creates genuine urgency for a leaders' meeting, but that urgency doesn't specifically favor late June over early July. In fact, early July would be logistically preferable - it provides more preparation time while still meeting the deadline. This shifts probability mass outside the resolution window.\n\nThe complete absence of preparation signals remains the dominant factor. No advance teams, no security preparations, no leaked itineraries - these are not things that can be hidden or organized in days for a presidential visit to China. The two available windows (June 19-23 and June 26-30) are each only 5 days, bracketing already-scheduled major summits.\n\nI maintain that the forecast shouldn't drop to zero because: (1) Trump has demonstrated willingness for unconventional moves, (2) an explicit invitation exists, (3) there's political incentive for a dramatic signing ceremony, and (4) even a brief technical stopover would resolve Yes. However, the tariff-timing argument meaningfully reduces the probability that any such meeting would be forced into the pre-July 1 window rather than early July.\n\nMy updated forecast of 6% reflects slightly greater confidence that IF a Trump-Xi meeting happens soon, it will occur in early July rather than late June, while still preserving non-trivial probability for Trump's unpredictability and the theoretical possibility of a rapid, short visit.",
