  "information": "For its first fiscal quarter of 2025, Domino's Pizza reported a 0.5% decline in U.S. same-store sales and missed revenue forecasts, but it exceeded earnings per share expectations. During that same quarter, the company repurchased 115,000 of its own shares. The company's 'Hungry for More' strategy aims to open over 1,000 new stores annually until 2028 and achieve 7% annual sales growth. As part of this strategy, Domino's is set to begin a collaboration with DoorDash in 2025, following a previous partnership with Uber Eats in 2023.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 9 days (Berkshire’s 13F for period ending 2025-03-31 is due by 2025-05-15)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the 13F reports the same or fewer DPZ shares (at or below 2,382,000)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire holds roughly the same DPZ position it revealed last quarter or trims it slightly; or it adds but obtains confidential treatment so the Q1 13F does not report an increased DPZ share count; or any additional buying happens after March 31 and thus won’t appear in the Q1 filing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire (likely Todd/Ted) continues accumulating DPZ during Q1 2025 and the 13F filed for 2025-03-31 shows any increase above 2,382,000 shares (even a small add), without confidentiality masking it.",
    "rationale": "Base rates and status quo favor no change. After initially disclosing a new DPZ stake, Berkshire often either pauses or builds gradually, but many positions are not increased in the immediately following quarter. The threshold here is strict: we only get a Yes if the 13F explicitly reports more than 2,382,000 shares. Equal or any form of non-disclosure resolves No.\n\nConsiderations supporting a modest chance of an increase: (1) Berkshire sometimes scales into mid-sized consumer/brand positions over multiple quarters; (2) Domino’s long-term fundamentals (asset-light franchising, expanding aggregator partnerships like Uber Eats and DoorDash, and growth plan) fit the Todd/Ted profile; (3) Q1 saw mixed company news (U.S. same-store -0.5%, revenue miss, EPS beat) that could have created dip-buying windows.\n\nConsiderations pushing against a higher probability: (1) Status quo inertia—most holdings don’t change quarter-to-quarter; (2) If Berkshire wanted to accumulate stealthily, they could seek confidential treatment, in which case the Q1 13F would not report an increase and this question would resolve No; (3) The stake size implied by 2.382M shares is already substantial, making immediate, visible add-ons less likely than a slower build; (4) Without clear evidence of significant Q1 price weakness relative to Berkshire’s perceived value, a pause is plausible.\n\nAssistant’s info used: Domino’s Q1 mix (comp softness, revenue miss, EPS beat), 115k shares repurchased by DPZ, and strategic growth/aggregator partnerships. These are supportive of the long-term thesis but not definitive catalysts for immediate additional Berkshire buying in Q1.\n\nWhy not higher: confidentiality risk plus typical Berkshire pacing and the likelihood of no change make a reported increase less than a coin flip. Why not lower: Berkshire does often leg into positions, and even a small add would meet the criterion.\n\nWhat would move me up: credible indications Berkshire was net buyer in Q1, notable DPZ price dips in Feb–Mar that align with Berkshire’s buying patterns, or any interim ownership filing hinting at accumulation. What would move me down: reports that Berkshire was a net seller of equities in Q1, signs of a confidential treatment request affecting positions like DPZ, or evidence DPZ rallied strongly through most of Q1, reducing the incentive to add.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Domino's Pizza stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nRetailWire: [Domino’s Pizza Stake Purchased by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Group](https://retailwire.com/dominos-pizza-warren-buffett/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 2,382,000 shares of Domino's Pizza, Inc.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
