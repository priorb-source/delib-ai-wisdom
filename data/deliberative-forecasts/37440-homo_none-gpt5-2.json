    "review": "Both forecasters converge on the same key hinge: whether a qualifying bill cleared both chambers before Sine Die. They add two useful emphases: (1) database-driven verification changes would not satisfy the resolution criterion if they don’t require voter-provided proof, and (2) Florida’s Senate often trims litigation‑exposed provisions late in session, increasing the chance any late push was softened. Forecaster 3 also notes Florida’s “law without signature” pathway, which marginally increases the conditional probability of enactment if passage occurred. Overall, their arguments reinforce the default that the regular session likely ended without enactment and that a special session focused on this before July 1 is uncommon. I find their reasoning largely convincing and directionally consistent with my prior, nudging me slightly downward.",
    "rationale": "Time left is short (~8 weeks), and the regular session is likely over. Given GOP control and gubernatorial support, if a bill passed near adjournment, enactment before July 1 would be highly likely. However, absent confirmation of passage, base rates and calendar friction suggest it probably did not clear both chambers. The NVRA/legal‑risk dynamic also makes it more likely leaders favored back‑end verification over documentary proof by voters, which would not trigger a Yes under this question. Special session odds before July 1 devoted to this issue look modest. Balancing these, I slightly lower my prior from 38% to 34%: roughly (25% chance it passed × ~95% enactment if passed) + (10% chance of a special session including this policy × ~60% passage/enactment) ≈ 24%–30%, with a small premium for the possibility it was tucked into an omnibus. Without concrete passage evidence, I shade toward the low‑mid 30s.",
