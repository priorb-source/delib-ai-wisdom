    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Muqtada al-Sadr's party currently boycotts the political process and is not expected to participate in the 2025 election.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Muqtada al-Sadr maintains his current position that the Iraqi political system is too corrupt for meaningful participation. He continues his boycott, viewing it as a more effective way to exert influence and maintain his image as a populist reformer. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without any announcement of his party's participation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing growing pressure from his base and the risk of political irrelevance as his rivals in the Coordination Framework consolidate power, Sadr makes a last-minute tactical reversal. Seeing a political opening, perhaps due to infighting among his opponents, he announces his participation to rally his supporters, catch his rivals off-guard, and re-assert his influence within the formal political system.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. Muqtada al-Sadr has not only been boycotting the political process but also recently reaffirmed this position, as noted in the background information. This is not a passive stance; he took the dramatic step of ordering his entire bloc of 73 MPs, the largest in parliament, to resign in 2022. This history indicates a deep and serious commitment to his boycott, which he justifies as a protest against endemic corruption and foreign influence. The fundamental political conditions that led to his withdrawal have not significantly changed, making a return to the same system without major concessions unlikely. The short timeframe of less than two months also reduces the likelihood of the kind of major political realignment that might entice him to reverse his decision.\n\nHowever, my forecast is not lower than 15% because Muqtada al-Sadr is notoriously unpredictable and has a history of abrupt strategic shifts. The primary reason he might choose to participate is the significant risk of his movement being permanently sidelined. If he perceives that his rivals in the Iran-aligned Coordination Framework are on the verge of cementing their power for another term, he might calculate that participation is the lesser of two evils to maintain his movement's relevance. He could frame a return as a response to popular demand to 'save the nation.'\n\nConversely, the probability is not higher because reversing such a firm and public boycott without a clear political victory would be a significant climb-down, potentially damaging his credibility with his followers. As of now, there are no public signals of negotiations or changing conditions that would provide him with the political cover needed for such a reversal.\n\nI would increase my probability forecast if credible reports emerged of high-level negotiations between the Sadrists and other major political blocs or if a significant political crisis unfolded that created a clear opportunity for his return. I would lower it further if Sadr were to issue a new, even more definitive statement explicitly ruling out participation in the 2025 election cycle.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
