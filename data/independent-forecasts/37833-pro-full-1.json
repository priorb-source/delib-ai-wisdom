  "information": "The relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has recently shown signs of strain. After investing heavily in Trump's 2024 campaign, Musk was appointed co-director of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). However, disagreements arose over Musk's proposals for drastic government spending cuts and his support for policies like H-1B visas, which conflicted with Trump's agenda. In May 2025, Musk announced he would reduce his political involvement and spending to focus on his businesses, leading to a mutually agreed-upon withdrawal from his role in DOGE. Correspondingly, analyses show that Trump has not mentioned Musk on his Truth Social account in over a month, a significant decrease from his previous frequency.\n\nThe Trump administration's current immigration policy focus is on a new 'Gold Card' visa plan designed to attract foreign investors with at least $5 million in funds. The plan, which is not yet passed by Congress, would grant permanent residence and work rights. Elon Musk confirmed on the social media platform X that the government is conducting a 'silent test' of the application website. The proposal has sparked debate on whether it will replace or supplement the existing EB-5 investment visa program. Separately, the administration opened the registration period for the H-1B visa program, which both Trump and Musk have supported, for the 2026 fiscal year in March 2025.\n\nRecent activity shows a shift in the priorities and communication styles of both Elon Musk and Donald Trump. An analysis of Musk's posts on X revealed that his content has shifted away from U.S. government and politics, with only 19% of his posts in May being on these topics compared to 51% in February. He is now posting more about his business ventures, including space travel, electric vehicles, and AI. Meanwhile, Donald Trump primarily uses Truth Social for his communications, with reports noting that posts from his account on X are rare.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (resolution on or after July 1, 2025; current date is May 22, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, neither Donald Trump nor Elon Musk will tweet the exact phrase \"diversity visa\".",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Donald Trump remains focused on his 'Gold Card' visa initiative and continues to use Truth Social as his primary communication platform. Elon Musk continues his trend of posting less about U.S. politics and more about his business ventures. No major political event or news story elevates the Diversity Visa program to a level that would compel a comment from either individual before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant news event, such as a high-profile crime or security incident involving a Diversity Visa recipient, becomes a major topic of national debate. In response, Donald Trump breaks his pattern and uses his X account to condemn the program with the exact phrase \"diversity visa\" to energize his base. Alternatively, Elon Musk gets into a public debate on X about immigration policy and uses the phrase while criticizing or comparing different visa systems.",
    "rationale": "The probability of a 'Yes' outcome is very low based on the current behaviors and stated priorities of both individuals. \n\n1.  **Platform Usage:** Donald Trump almost exclusively uses Truth Social. A post from his account on X is a rare event, significantly lowering the baseline probability of him posting anything there, let alone a specific phrase.\n\n2.  **Shifting Focus:** The research shows Elon Musk is deliberately pivoting away from U.S. political commentary on X, with such posts dropping from 51% to 19% of his content between February and May. His focus is on his businesses. This makes a spontaneous tweet on a niche political topic unlikely.\n\n3.  **Policy Priorities:** The Trump administration's current immigration focus is the new 'Gold Card' plan for wealthy investors. Musk's stated interest is in high-skill H-1B visas. The Diversity Visa lottery aligns with neither of these priorities, so it is unlikely to be a topic they are actively discussing or planning to comment on.\n\n4.  **Strained Relationship:** The reported cooling of the relationship between Trump and Musk makes it less likely Musk would tweet in support of a Trump-driven talking point, or vice versa.\n\n**Why the probability isn't lower (e.g., 1%):** Both individuals are known for their unpredictable and reactive social media behavior. Immigration is a volatile political issue, and an unexpected news event could easily trigger an impulsive post. The barrier to posting is very low, and a single tweet is all that is required.\n\n**Why the probability isn't higher (e.g., 10%):** The confluence of factors—Trump's absence from X, Musk's intentional depoliticization of his feed, and their joint focus on other areas of immigration policy—creates a strong case for the status quo. The ~6-week timeframe is also relatively short for a non-urgent topic to capture their attention.\n\nAn update towards 'Yes' would require a major news event focused on the Diversity Visa or a significant, visible change in the social media habits of either Trump or Musk.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**. If not, it resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has recently shown signs of strain.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
