    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. Forecaster 2 provides a compelling bearish case, framing the nine months since licensing as a 'prolonged delay' and evidence of slow progress. This perspective astutely highlights the risk posed by the very short remaining time frame (~45 days) and forces a critical look at the status quo. Forecaster 3 presents a bullish case similar to my own but adds a crucial piece of new information: that the Starlink map's current status for Sri Lanka is 'Starting Soon.' This detail is highly significant. I find Forecaster 3's reasoning, supported by this new positive evidence, more convincing than Forecaster 2's interpretation of inaction. The 'Starting Soon' status directly counters the 'slow progress' narrative and is a strong leading indicator of an imminent launch.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 75% was based on the August 2024 license approval, which cleared the primary regulatory hurdle, and my assumption that the subsequent nine months was a reasonable period for operational setup. The deliberation has introduced two conflicting interpretations of this nine-month period. Forecaster 2's argument that this represents a 'delay' was a valid risk I had not fully weighted. However, Forecaster 3's information that the official Starlink map shows Sri Lanka as 'Starting Soon' is a decisive piece of evidence. This status is typically the final stage before service becomes 'Available' and indicates that Starlink's internal processes and preparations are nearly complete. It reframes the nine-month period not as a delay, but as the time required to reach this pre-launch phase. This direct, positive signal from the company itself significantly outweighs the inference of slow progress. While the risk of a last-minute logistical or bureaucratic snag pushing the launch past the close deadline still exists, the 'Starting Soon' status suggests the company is on track and intends to launch imminently. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast to reflect this higher certainty.",
