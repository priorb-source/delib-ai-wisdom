  "information": "Somalia's National Communications Authority granted Starlink a full operating license in mid-April 2025, following approximately two and a half years of discussions. On April 13, 2025, Elon Musk announced on social media, \"Starlink is in Somalia.\" At a ceremony in Mogadishu, Starlink representatives stated the service would be available nationwide soon. Somali government officials, including the Minister of Communications and Technology, publicly welcomed the service, highlighting its potential to provide internet access across the country. As of mid-May 2025, the official Starlink availability map listed Somalia as \"Not Available\" or \"Coming Soon.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks from May 15, 2025 to the July 1, 2025 deadline",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the Starlink availability map currently shows Somalia as 'Not Available' or 'Coming Soon', which does not meet the resolution criteria of showing 'Available'",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the April 2025 license approval and Musk's announcement, Starlink encounters delays in establishing the necessary ground infrastructure, payment systems, or operational capacity in Somalia. The map continues to show 'Coming Soon' through July 1, reflecting ongoing deployment work but not yet full availability",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Having secured the license in mid-April 2025, Starlink completes its technical infrastructure setup including ground stations and local partnerships over the next 6 weeks. The company updates its availability map to show Somalia as 'Available' in late May or June 2025, delivering on the 'soon' promise made at the Mogadishu ceremony",
    "rationale": "The question has significant uncertainty despite positive indicators. Favoring YES: Somalia granted a full operating license in mid-April 2025, Elon Musk made a public announcement on April 13, Starlink representatives promised availability 'soon', and there are still 6.5 weeks until the deadline - a reasonable timeframe for completing rollout. Starlink has demonstrated ability to deploy quickly in other markets once licensing is secured. Favoring NO: Status quo bias is critical here - the map still shows 'Not Available' or 'Coming Soon' despite 4+ weeks passing since the license and announcement. Moving from approval to actual 'Available' status requires operational infrastructure including ground stations, payment systems, and local partnerships. Somalia's challenging security and infrastructure environment may complicate deployment. The vague timeline of 'soon' could extend beyond July 1. I weight the status quo heavily because worlds change slowly. While the regulatory approval is complete and public commitments have been made, the lack of map updates after a month suggests deployment complexity. For this forecast to move higher (70-80%), I would need evidence of actual service testing, specific launch dates announced, or ground infrastructure completion. For it to move lower (40-50%), I would need reports of deployment delays, technical challenges, or Starlink backing away from the 'soon' timeline. At 60%, I'm giving slightly better than even odds, acknowledging that the major regulatory hurdle is cleared and the timeline is feasible, while respecting that operational deployment takes time and the current status remains unchanged",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Somalia as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Musk announces Starlink license for Somalia](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Musk_announces_Starlink_license_for_Somalia_999.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Somalia listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSomalia's National Communications Authority granted Starlink a full operating license in mid-April 2025, following approximately two and a half years of discussions.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
