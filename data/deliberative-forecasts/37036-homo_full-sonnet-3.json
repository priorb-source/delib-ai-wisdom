    "review": "All three of us independently arrived at 30%, which is notable convergence. The other forecasters made essentially the same key points: Osborn's 'early summer' statement naturally refers to June/July (after the deadline), his exploratory committee formed only 2-3 weeks ago, typical exploratory periods are 3-6 months, and his 2024 pattern suggests June-July 2025 for a 2026 race. They also identified the same upward pressures: Trump's endorsement, other candidates announcing in April, and definitional ambiguity around 'early summer.' Neither forecaster presented genuinely new evidence or arguments beyond what was in the research report and my initial analysis. The convergence itself is weak evidence that 30% is approximately correct, but this could simply reflect similar analytical approaches to identical source material rather than independent information. No forecaster identified compelling reasons to significantly deviate from 30%, and the balance of factors remains unchanged.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find no compelling reason to update my forecast. The convergence at 30% strengthens my confidence that this probability appropriately captures the tension between two forces: (1) the base rate evidence strongly suggesting a post-June 1 announcement (Osborn's explicit 'early summer' timeline, recent exploratory committee formation, historical patterns showing 3-6 month exploratory periods, and his own 2024 precedent of July announcement), and (2) meaningful upside risk from potential timeline acceleration (Trump's attack, other candidates moving faster, definitional ambiguity, and 38 remaining days being sufficient time for circumstances to change). The 30% probability reflects that while the modal outcome is a June/July announcement, there's roughly a 1-in-3 chance of factors pushing the timeline forward into late May. This balances the strong directional evidence toward 'No' against genuine uncertainty about political pressures and timeline flexibility. The absence of any new evidence or novel arguments from the other forecasters confirms that the analysis is stable given available information.",
