    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a critical piece of information I completely missed: UFC 315 is scheduled in Perth, Australia. This is a game-changing detail that fundamentally alters the analysis. Both F2 and F3 independently emphasize that Trump has virtually never attended international UFC events, which makes perfect sense given the logistical barriers, security complexities, time commitment (20+ hours each way), and reduced political value of appearing before a foreign audience. F2's reasoning is particularly compelling - the international location breaks Trump's established pattern of US-only UFC attendance. F3's 30% forecast seems inconsistent with their own acknowledgment that international locations dramatically reduce probability. F2's 5% appears more aligned with the evidence. My original 20% was based on incomplete information about the event location, which was a significant analytical error.",
    "rationale": "Upon learning UFC 315 is in Perth, Australia, I must dramatically revise my forecast downward. The key factors are: (1) Trump has no documented history of attending international UFC events despite numerous opportunities; (2) The logistical burden of intercontinental travel for a single sporting event is prohibitive for a former president with security requirements and scheduling constraints; (3) The political benefit to Trump of appearing before an Australian audience is minimal compared to domestic events; (4) The time commitment alone (40+ hours round-trip travel plus event attendance) makes this highly impractical. My forecast is not 1% because Trump's unpredictability and strong personal relationship with Dana White leave open a small possibility of an extraordinary arrangement, perhaps if he had other business in the Asia-Pacific region. However, the overwhelming evidence points to non-attendance. The international location transforms this from 'unlikely but plausible' to 'highly improbable.' I should have researched the event location before making my initial forecast.",
