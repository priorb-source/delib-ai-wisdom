    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: short window, consistent authoritarian consolidation since 2020–21, weak external leverage after ECOWAS withdrawal, AES alignment, and low likelihood of a court-driven reversal. They add two useful angles I hadn’t emphasized: (1) MINUSMA’s exit further reduces external pressure, and (2) regional comparators (Burkina Faso, Niger) haven’t quickly reversed similar restrictions. They also flag WAEMU as a conceivable but presently inactive lever. I find their reasoning sound and well-calibrated for a short horizon; no clear overlooked pro-reversal mechanism emerged.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is about 40 days. The May 13 dissolution is a high-salience move consistent with the junta’s trajectory: suspending party activity in 2024, exiting ECOWAS, and tightening control. Reversing soon would signal weakness absent a shock. External coercive leverage is limited: ECOWAS pressure is muted; MINUSMA is gone; Russia-aligned support reduces Western leverage. WAEMU-related financial pressure could, in theory, bite, but there’s no clear sign it will do so on this specific issue within the window. Domestic triggers (large-scale unrest, elite fracture, or acute fiscal crisis) could force a tactical U-turn and a decree could be rescinded quickly, but such shocks are infrequent and typically take longer to translate into formal reversals. Partial measures (e.g., allowing independents or regime-created structures) wouldn’t satisfy resolution criteria. Given the convergence of analyses and added considerations (MINUSMA exit and regional comparators), I make a small downward adjustment from my prior 8% to 7%.",
