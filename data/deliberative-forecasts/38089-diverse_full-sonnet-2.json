    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I should consider more carefully. Forecaster 3's observation that Erdoğan has historically polled higher than Sánchez on Morning Consult introduces a reversion-to-mean risk I hadn't fully weighted. If the current 3-point Sánchez lead represents a deviation from historical norms, it may be less stable than I assumed. Forecaster 3 also highlights resolution technicalities (tie = No, timing of updates, measurement noise, potential data availability issues) that add legitimate uncertainty. Forecaster 2's point about Sánchez's narrow coalition making him vulnerable to sudden domestic crises is valid, though somewhat speculative given no immediate indicators of crisis. The emphasis on Turkey's underlying structural challenges (high inflation, tight monetary policy) as headwinds to Erdoğan despite improved consumer confidence is a useful counterbalance. However, I note that the historical reversion claim lacks direct evidence in our materials, and the 32-day timeframe significantly limits how much reversion can occur. The convergence of our forecasts (60-67%) suggests we're all weighing similar factors with modest differences in emphasis.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I remain anchored on the May 8 status quo (Sánchez 35%, Erdoğan 32%) but acknowledge the other forecasters identify legitimate risks I underweighted. The historical reversion argument has merit - if Erdoğan typically polls higher, the current ordering may be more fragile. Resolution technicalities (ties count as No, measurement noise, data timing) add small but real downside risk to a narrow lead. Turkey's structural economic challenges (inflation, monetary tightening) may cap Erdoğan's upside despite April's consumer confidence gains. However, the 32-day horizon remains the dominant factor - large swings in leader approval are uncommon over such short periods absent major shocks. The 3-point gap, while narrow, still requires meaningful movement to reverse. Spain's relatively strong economic position in Europe provides Sánchez some stability. I'm updating modestly downward to acknowledge reversion and resolution risks while maintaining that the status quo more likely than not favors YES. My forecast moves from 67% to 64%, aligning more closely with the consensus range while still reflecting that the current data point favors Sánchez continuing to lead.",
