    "review": "Forecaster 3 identified the critical piece of information that both Forecaster 2 and I missed: the actual finalist list shows only ONE woman (Cassie Piuma) among the Outstanding Chef finalists. This is a fundamental error in my analysis. I was forecasting under uncertainty about the finalist composition, assuming 2-3 women based on regional award trends, when the actual data was available in the provided source. Forecaster 3 correctly recognized that with only 1 woman out of approximately 5 finalists, the structural probability is much lower than my 45% forecast. Their reasoning about no vote-splitting among women is sound, as is their modest upward adjustment from the naive 20% to account for Piuma's strong profile at Sarma and the Foundation's equity values. Forecaster 2 made the same mistake I did by not checking the actual finalist list. This is a significant oversight that requires a substantial downward revision of my forecast.",
    "rationale": "Upon reviewing the arguments, I must significantly revise my forecast downward. The key new information is that Cassie Piuma is the ONLY woman finalist for Outstanding Chef in 2025. This changes everything. My original 45% forecast was based on assumed finalist compositions of 2-3 women out of 5, which would have supported a near-50% probability. With only 1 of 5 finalists being a woman, the structural baseline drops to approximately 20%. I should adjust upward from this baseline for several reasons: (1) Piuma leads Sarma, a nationally acclaimed restaurant, (2) the equity initiative may influence voting even with a male-dominated slate, (3) no vote-splitting among female candidates, and (4) women have won from male-dominated fields historically. However, the adjustments are modest because: (1) the male-dominated finalist slate itself suggests the equity initiative hasn't fully transformed this particular award category, (2) recent winners in 2023 and 2024 were both men, indicating current voting patterns favor male chefs, and (3) with 4 male finalists, probability of a male winner remains structurally high. My revised forecast of 30% reflects a baseline 20% with modest upward adjustments for Piuma's credentials and equity considerations, while acknowledging the structural disadvantage of being 1 of 5 finalists.",
