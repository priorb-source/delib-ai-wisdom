    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The Wikipedia page currently lists all seven countries as blocking X (Twitter). If the page remains unchanged, the question will resolve as Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the seven countries is removed from the 'currently blocked' list on the Wikipedia page before July 1, 2025. This could be due to an editorial change, perhaps re-evaluating the nature of the block in a country like Venezuela, or in the less likely event of a sudden policy reversal by one of the governments that is then reflected on the page.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The governments of China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela maintain their existing censorship policies regarding X. The Wikipedia article continues to reflect this established reality, and the list of countries currently blocking the platform remains unchanged at the time of resolution.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high degree of inertia for two key factors: the censorship policies of the specified countries and the content of the Wikipedia page itself. All seven nations are authoritarian states where blocking western social media is a long-standing and integral part of state information control; a policy reversal in any of them within the next month is extremely improbable. Furthermore, the facts are well-established and sourced on Wikipedia, making it unlikely that an editor would remove a country from the list without a significant, verifiable real-world event, such as a formal announcement that a ban has been lifted. The short timeframe of less than a month makes such a major change even less likely. My forecast is not higher because the resolution depends on the state of a publicly editable webpage. There is a small but non-zero chance of an edit war, a successful but inaccurate edit, or a re-interpretation of the sourcing for one of the countries (most plausibly Venezuela, where blocks are sometimes described as intermittent) that could lead to a 'No' resolution. My forecast is not lower because the dual inertia of entrenched geopolitical policy across seven different countries and established Wikipedia consensus creates a very high barrier for a 'No' outcome to occur. The lack of any new information from my research assistant reinforces that the status quo is stable.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
