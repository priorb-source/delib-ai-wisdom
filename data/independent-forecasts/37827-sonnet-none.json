    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days until outcome is known (9 days until June 2025 begins, plus 30 days of June, plus verification time on or after July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - if current reporting patterns continue unchanged, pilot UFO reports from Africa to NUFORC are rare enough that having zero reports in any specific one-month period is the most likely outcome",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No pilots in African countries observe or report UFO/UAP phenomena to NUFORC during June 2025, or any such reports are delayed in processing and not posted to the NUFORC database by the time Metaculus checks on July 1, 2025",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one commercial, military, or private pilot operating in any of Africa's 54 countries observes an unusual aerial phenomenon during June 2025 and submits a report to NUFORC, which then posts it to their database during or shortly after June",
    "rationale": "The provided example demonstrates that pilot reports from Africa do reach NUFORC (Rwanda, January 1, 2025), establishing that such reports are possible and that African pilots are aware of and use this reporting mechanism. However, several factors suggest this is a relatively low-probability event for any single month. First, pilot UFO reports are inherently rare compared to civilian reports - pilots represent a small fraction of potential observers and face professional disincentives to report unusual sightings. Second, the timeframe is narrow at just 30 days. Third, if we assume roughly 1-2 pilot reports from Africa reach NUFORC annually (extrapolating from the single January 2025 example), the probability for any specific month would be approximately 8-17% assuming even distribution. However, reports may cluster unevenly throughout the year. Africa's large size (54 countries, extensive airspace) and active aviation sector increase the probability somewhat, as does the fact that only ONE report is needed for resolution. The forecast is not higher because pilot reports remain rare events requiring both an unusual sighting AND the pilot's willingness to report it to a U.S.-based database. The forecast is not lower because we have concrete evidence such reports do occur from this region. I would update higher if data showed a higher historical rate of African pilot reports to NUFORC, or if there were reports of increased unusual aerial activity in the region. I would update lower if the January report appeared to be an anomaly or if pilot reporting rates from Africa appeared to be declining.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
