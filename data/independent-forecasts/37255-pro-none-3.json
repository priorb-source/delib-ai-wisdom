    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current political division between the rival governments in Libya persists. The legislature remains deadlocked and focused on internal power struggles, preventing it from addressing and completing the multi-step process of ratifying an international trade agreement before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unexpected, major political breakthrough occurs, leading to the formation of a unified government. Seeking to demonstrate legitimacy and international cooperation, this new government prioritizes and fast-tracks the ratification of AfCFTA, completing the entire legislative and diplomatic process in the short time remaining.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly driven by Libya's severe and protracted political fragmentation and legislative paralysis. The country is effectively run by two rival administrations, making any cohesive national policy, let alone the ratification of a complex international treaty, exceedingly difficult. The status quo is one of deadlock, which heavily favors a 'No' outcome. With only two months remaining until the deadline, the timeline is extremely tight even for a stable, functioning government. The process of legislative debate, approval, and depositing the instrument of ratification is unlikely to be completed in this timeframe given the current political environment where priorities are squarely focused on security, power consolidation, and managing the national economy. My probability is not lower than 2% to account for a small, but non-zero, chance of a sudden political settlement where ratifying AfCFTA is included as a quick, symbolic win to signal unity and progress to the international community. For my forecast to increase, I would need to see concrete evidence of a political unification deal being implemented and the Libyan legislature scheduling a vote on ratification. Conversely, any further escalation of internal conflict would decrease the probability further.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Libya ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [African Continental Free Trade Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Continental_Free_Trade_Area)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Libya ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
