    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Francis Suarez has not announced his candidacy as of June 5, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Suarez continues deliberating but does not make a formal announcement before July 1st, either deciding to announce later in the summer or choosing not to run at all for Florida governor",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Suarez completes his decision-making process in the next 3-4 weeks and makes a formal announcement of his gubernatorial candidacy before the July 1st deadline",
    "rationale": "The Axios article from May 2, 2025 indicates Suarez was actively considering a gubernatorial bid approximately 34 days ago. However, over a month has passed since that report with no announcement materializing and no additional information suggesting an imminent decision. This creates a strong status quo bias toward a No outcome. While 26 days is technically sufficient time to announce a candidacy, the lack of movement over the past month suggests either indecision, a decision not to run, or planning for an announcement after July 1st. Political campaigns typically generate increasing buzz and media attention leading up to announcements, and the absence of such signals in my research assistant's report is telling. The probability is not lower (e.g., 10-15%) because the May article demonstrates genuine consideration and 26 days does provide a reasonable window for announcement. It's not higher (e.g., 50%+) because the extended period without action strongly suggests the announcement, if it happens, will likely come after July 1st or not at all. I would update higher if new reporting emerged about campaign infrastructure being built or announcement events being scheduled. I would update lower if reports suggested Suarez was backing away from the race or if we got within a week of July 1st with no signals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Francis Suarez announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Miami mayor weighs gubernatorial bid](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/02/florida-governor-miami-mayor-francis-suarez)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Francis Suarez announces his candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
