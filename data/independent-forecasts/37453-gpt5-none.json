    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 55 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Alberta government continues combative rhetoric with Ottawa and advances autonomy files (e.g., pension, policing, tax collection) but does not cross the line into formally announcing a secession referendum date. With a likely federal election approaching and strong national conservative polling, the Premier opts to keep leverage without risking backlash from investors, moderates, and allies by scheduling a referendum.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp escalation with Ottawa (e.g., federal emissions cap enforcement or a high-profile federal intervention in Alberta’s resource sector) or a deliberate political gambit leads the Premier and Cabinet (or equivalent authorized entity) to announce—via an official statement or Order in Council—a referendum date on Alberta independence, potentially set for later in 2025 or beyond, but the announcement occurs before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Scheduling an independence referendum is an extreme, high-salience step that governments generally telegraph well in advance. There are only ~8 weeks left. The Alberta government has pursued assertive autonomy measures but has consistently stopped short of advocating outright separation; scheduling such a referendum would risk significant economic and political costs and is unnecessary given the prospect of a friendlier federal government after the next election. The Politico piece highlights rising sentiment, but that is far from a formal scheduling within weeks. Practical signals that would typically precede scheduling—cabinet orders in draft, legislative preparation, public consultations, or credible media reports—have not surfaced to my knowledge. The research assistant provided no additional information, which I interpret as no known ongoing formal process. Incentives: - Near-term political calculus favors maintaining pressure without triggering a national crisis. - Business community and many UCP moderates would likely oppose a secession vote, especially announced on short notice. - With the legality of the referendum deemed irrelevant for resolution, only political will matters—but the political bar is still high. Why not higher: The short timeline, absence of preparatory steps, Premier’s prior positioning against outright separation, and the availability of less risky leverage tools (e.g., Sovereignty Act posturing, litigation, policy opt-outs) keep the odds low. Why not lower: Alberta politics can be confrontational; an external shock or a strategic move to energize the base before a federal campaign could prompt an announcement. The question resolves Yes even if the scheduled date is far in the future, so a low-probability ‘announce now, vote later’ path exists. What would move me up: - Credible reporting of cabinet considering an Order in Council for a referendum. - Premier or key ministers explicitly committing to announce a referendum date. - A major, acute Ottawa–Alberta clash (e.g., punitive federal action on energy) paired with strong pro-referendum caucus momentum. - Tabling of referendum-related legislation or official consultations specifically about secession. What would move me down: - Clear denials from the Premier ruling out an independence referendum this year. - Shift of government focus to other referendums (e.g., pension plan) or economic files. - Calmer federal–provincial tone or signs Alberta is waiting on the federal election outcome.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
