    "review": "Both forecasters provide crucial information I had not fully incorporated. Forecaster 3's specific detail that the tariffs took effect April 9, 2025, and that Lesotho was explicitly excluded from the 90-day pause given to other countries is critical new evidence. This strongly suggests the 50% tariff is already posted in the HTS system. Forecaster 2's emphasis on bureaucratic procedures for HTS updates is also compelling - even if diplomatic negotiations succeeded, actually implementing changes to the HTS database within 39 days would be challenging. Both forecasters appropriately weight the short timeline more heavily than I did initially. However, I find Forecaster 2's 85% slightly overconfident given the extreme international pressure and catastrophic impact on Lesotho, which could motivate unusually rapid action. Forecaster 3's 75% seems more calibrated, appropriately balancing the strong status quo bias against non-trivial pathways for change. The key insight I missed was that with the tariff already implemented and active since April 9, we're not forecasting whether it will be imposed, but whether it will be removed or modified within a very short window.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast upward based on three key factors: (1) The tariff is already in effect as of April 9, 2025, meaning the status quo heavily favors a 'Yes' resolution - the burden is now on removing or modifying it rather than imposing it; (2) Lesotho was deliberately excluded from the 90-day pause extended to other countries, indicating the administration has already made a conscious decision to maintain this tariff level; (3) The 39-day timeline combined with bureaucratic procedures for updating the HTS creates substantial inertia, meaning even successful negotiations would struggle to produce implementation before June 1. My initial 58% underweighted these status quo factors. However, I'm not going as high as 85% because the extreme circumstances (catastrophic impact on a small developing nation, international pressure from SADC, negative optics) could motivate faster-than-usual executive action, and we cannot be 100% certain the current posted rate is exactly 50% rather than a nearby figure. The resolution criterion that 'suspended' still counts also supports a higher probability. Balancing the strong status quo bias against these modest downside risks, I'm settling at 72%.",
