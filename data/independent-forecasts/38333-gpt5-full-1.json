  "information": "The 2026 Florida gubernatorial race involves several candidates. For the Republican nomination, Congressman Byron Donalds has launched his campaign and received an endorsement from former President Trump. Other potential Republican candidates include Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis, former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, and Lt. Governor Jeanette Nuñez. On the Democratic side, former U.S. Representative David Jolly has announced his candidacy. State senator Jason Pizzo also announced he will run as an independent. Florida's primary election is scheduled for August 18, 2026, with the general election on November 3, 2026.\n\nAs of early June 2025, Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has publicly stated he is considering a run for governor. A poll conducted by The James Madison Institute in May 2025 showed Suarez with 5% support in the Republican primary field. In local politics, the Miami City Commission was set to vote on a proposal to move the city's November election to 2026, which would extend the terms of current commissioners and Mayor Suarez by one year.\n\nHistorically, in the last two open Florida gubernatorial cycles (2018 and 2022), major candidates typically announced their campaigns 12 to 18 months before the primary election. For the 2026 cycle, some contenders, such as Republican Byron Donalds and Democrat David Jolly, had already announced their candidacies by early June 2025. Reports note that as of early June, there have been no leaks of a launch date, no exploratory committee paperwork filed by Suarez, and no scheduled kickoff events for a gubernatorial campaign.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Suarez continues to publicly “consider” the race but holds off announcing through June, waiting for the field to clarify (e.g., Casey DeSantis’ decision), donor commitments, and the Miami City Commission’s election-timing decision. July 1 arrives with no formal launch.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Suarez quickly lines up key donors and staff, the city election-timing issue breaks favorably (or he decides it won’t deter him), and he schedules a mid-to-late June kickoff event in Miami, announcing before July 1 to position himself 14 months ahead of the 2026 primary.",
    "rationale": "Time window: ~26 days. Status quo favors inaction; absent concrete launch signals, a No is more likely.\nEvidence and context: Per the assistant’s report, Suarez is only at ~5% in a May 2025 GOP primary poll, has not filed paperwork, formed an exploratory vehicle, or scheduled a launch event. Axios (May 2) frames him as weighing a bid. Byron Donalds has already launched and reportedly has Trump’s endorsement; David Jolly is in on the Democratic side. Historically, viable Florida gubernatorial candidates often announce 12–18 months before the primary, which puts June 2025 inside the typical window—so some chance exists. However, the lack of leaks or visible ramp-up this close to month-end lowers the near-term probability. The Miami City Commission’s pending decision to move the city election to 2026 (extending terms) could further complicate a June announcement by raising potential resign-to-run issues or personal calculus—another reason to delay. Suarez’s 2023 presidential bid shows he’s willing to take swings, but after that experience, caution now is plausible.\nWhy not higher: No clear preparatory signals (staff hires, finance chair, event permits, web domains/launch video hints), weak early polling, and a Trump-aligned rival already running reduce incentives to jump in immediately. The municipal election-timing uncertainty also argues for waiting past June.\nWhy not lower: The calendar is still within the common 12–18 month announcement window, and a late-June announcement is feasible if donors coalesce or if he wants a clean Q3 fundraising start and early narrative. Political decisions can move quickly once a green light is given.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting of a set launch date/venue, opening a state campaign account, visible staffing or vendor hires, major donor commitments, or clarity that the city election won’t extend his term (reducing legal/political friction). Signals that Casey DeSantis won’t run or that Donalds stumbles could also spur an earlier move.\nWhat would move me down: Reports he’s passing on the race, endorsing another candidate, filing for a different office, the city extending terms to 2026 (increasing costs/complexity), or new polling showing very limited viability.",
