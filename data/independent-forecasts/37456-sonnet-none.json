    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall remains Active",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FSIS investigation continues beyond July 1, 2025. The recall stays Active as regulators verify that all contaminated product has been removed from distribution, confirm corrective actions at manufacturing facilities, and ensure no additional safety concerns exist. The verification process extends beyond the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cargill successfully completes its corrective actions within the next 55 days. The FSIS verifies that all affected liquid egg products have been removed from commerce, confirms that the cleaning solution contamination issue has been resolved at the source, and changes the recall status to Closed before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The recall was issued on March 28, 2025, making it approximately 40 days old as of today (May 7, 2025). The question asks if it will close within the next 55 days, giving a total window of about 95 days (roughly 3 months) from issuance to deadline. USDA-FSIS food recalls typically take several weeks to several months to close, depending on the scope of distribution, the nature of the contamination, and the speed of corrective actions. The recall involves an unapproved substance (cleaning solution) in liquid eggs, which is a serious food safety issue but appears to have an identifiable source. Since the recall has already been active for 40 days without closure, the status quo strongly favors it remaining active. However, 95 days total represents a plausible timeframe for some recalls to close, particularly if Cargill acts swiftly and the product distribution was limited. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the recall is still active after 40 days, suggesting complexity or breadth requiring more time; (2) many FSIS recalls take 4-6 months to close; (3) verification processes are thorough and time-consuming. My forecast is not lower because: (1) 3+ months is a reasonable resolution timeframe for straightforward cases; (2) Cargill is a large, established company likely capable of rapid response; (3) some recalls do close within 2-3 months. I would revise upward with evidence of imminent closure or precedents showing similar recalls closing quickly. I would revise downward with information about wide distribution, complex investigation, or statements suggesting extended timelines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/cargill-kitchen-solutions-recalls-liquid-egg-products-due-unapproved-substance) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
