  "information": "At the 16th BRICS Summit, a 'partner country' framework was introduced. Of the initial invitees, Indonesia has since become a full member. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed their participation in the partner framework. On May 30, 2025, Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev publicly ruled out seeking full membership, stating that his country would maintain its observer status. He cited the organization's lack of permanent structures and a formal charter as reasons for this decision.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5–6 weeks (cutoff 00:00 on July 8, 2025 in Rio time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new country is invited as a full BRICS member before or at the 17th Summit.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BRICS emphasizes institutional deliverables and the new partner-country track in Rio, notes Saudi Arabia’s pending status (which doesn’t count), and defers further enlargement to build consensus. India remains cautious; Brazil balances ties with the West and avoids controversy. No country achieves unanimous backing in time.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Unanimous agreement coalesces to upgrade one partner to full membership—e.g., Algeria, Malaysia, Thailand, Nigeria, Belarus, or Vietnam—and the invitation is announced at foreign ministers’ meetings in June or at the Rio Summit. A single, politically ‘balanced’ addition is framed as manageable, following Indonesia’s accession.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and timing: We are roughly five weeks from the Rio summit, and there have been no credible leaks naming the next accession candidate. Historically, BRICS expansions (2023) and the 2024 partner rollout were preceded by signaling. The lack of public consensus cues this close to the summit tilts toward no new invite by July 7.\n- Process and unanimity: Unanimous consent is required. China and Russia push for expansion; India has been the main brake. Brazil (as 2025 chair/host) supports Global South leadership but tends to balance relations and may prefer consolidation over rapid enlargement in its host year.\n- Recent expansion momentum cuts both ways: The bloc added four new members on Jan 1, 2024, then introduced the partner track in 2024, and—per the assistant’s note—Indonesia acceded on Jan 6, 2025. That shows capacity to expand, but also suggests “one-and-done” for the cycle before Rio, making another addition within months less likely without strong advance notice.\n- Candidate readiness signals: Among 2024 partner invitees, Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not even confirmed partner participation, which reduces near-term odds of their leap to full membership. Kazakhstan’s president publicly ruled out seeking full membership on May 30, 2025, removing a plausible near-term candidate. Others (e.g., Malaysia, Thailand, Nigeria, Belarus, Cuba, Uzbekistan, Uganda, Bolivia) vary in alignment and readiness; several would be politically sensitive for Brazil/India in a compressed timeline.\n- What doesn’t count: Any new steps related to Saudi Arabia’s pending acceptance or a re-invitation to Argentina would not resolve this market, lowering headline chances from otherwise plausible “news” at the summit.\nWhy not higher: No concrete, convergent signaling; India’s known caution; compressed timeline; some key partners not even confirmed at partner level; one fresh accession (Indonesia) already this year could reduce appetite for another before July.\nWhy not lower: Expansion remains a stated goal; the partner track is a pipeline; a single, consensus pick is still feasible if leaders strike a late deal. Brazil could seek a tangible summit ‘win.’\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of consensus on a named candidate; joint Brazil–India statements endorsing a shortlist/timeline; summit agenda leaks featuring membership expansion; partner countries publicly signaling readiness and bilateral green lights with India and Brazil.\nWhat would move me down: Public statements from India or Brazil signaling a pause on new full members for 2025; reporting that the Rio agenda focuses on institutional and financial initiatives with no membership items; continued lack of pre-summit chatter by late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a new country be invited to BRICS at the 17th BRICS Summit?\n\nQuestion background:\n[BRICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS) is an intergovernmental organization originally founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which held their first formal summit in 2009. South Africa was invited to join in 2010, completing the original five-member grouping. BRICS serves as a forum for cooperation among major emerging economies, with a focus on economic development, political coordination, and reform of international institutions.\n\nAt the [15th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_BRICS_summit) in August 2023, the group announced a major expansion. Full membership invitations were extended to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Argentina later declined the invitation, while Saudi Arabia has not formally accepted. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE officially joined on January 1, 2024.&#x20;\n\nAt the [16th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_BRICS_summit) in October 2024, held in Kazan, Russia, BRICS formally introduced a new partner country framework. Thirteen countries were invited as partners at the 16th Summit: Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed participation. Indonesia later joined as a full member on January 6, 2025.\n\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled to take place on July 6–7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many countries have formally expressed interest in joining BRICS, but new members can only be admitted with unanimous agreement from existing members. While expansion remains a stated goal of the bloc, no new invitations have been confirmed.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if at least one previously not invited country is invited to join BRICS as a full member during or before the 17th BRICS summit.\n\nThis question will only resolve based upon an invitation for full membership, not partner status or any other status in the organisation.\n\n* An invitation of a partner country to become a full member will resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* Reinvitation of Saudi Arabia or Argentina will not be sufficient to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Whether or not a country accepts its invitation will have no impact on this question.\n* If the 17th BRICS summit is delayed, that will not impact this question unless the delay is to after August 31, 2025, in which case this question will be annulled.\n* The specific cutoff for resolution will be 00:00 following the final day of the summit. For example, if the summit is held as expected on July 6-7, the cutoff will be July 8, 00:00. This question will use the timezone of the summit's location, if the summit has no physical location, it will use UTC.\n* For the purposes of this question, \"country\" is defined as a UN member state.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAt the 16th BRICS Summit, a 'partner country' framework was introduced.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
