  "information": "A proposal to ban the 'Tush Push' play, initially submitted by the Green Bay Packers, was discussed at the NFL's annual meeting in early April 2025. The proposal was tabled after receiving support from 16 of the NFL's 32 teams, short of the 24 votes required to pass a rule change. The proposal is scheduled to be revisited at the spring league meeting on May 20-21, 2025, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nMultiple reports indicate that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell favors the ban. Goodell has stated that the play 'feels more like rugby' than football and that returning to pre-2005 rules that banned pushing players 'makes a lot of sense.' The NFL league office also reportedly wants to eliminate the play. Additionally, the NFL's Competition Committee and health and safety officials, including Dr. Allen Sills, have expressed concerns about the play's potential for injury.\n\nThe original proposal is being reworked into a broader rule that would prohibit pushing or pulling a ball carrier anywhere on the field, not just in the specific quarterback sneak formation. This change aims to frame the issue around general football principles rather than targeting a specific team. On the other hand, the NFL's health and safety department possesses no data indicating any injuries have occurred from the 'Tush Push'. The Philadelphia Eagles, who have used the play with a high success rate, have vocally opposed the ban.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known by June 1, 2025. The critical event is the scheduled NFL spring league meeting on May 20-21, 2025 (8 days away), which is the last realistic opportunity for a rule change before the resolution date. The question fully resolves in 20 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the Tush Push remains legal. The play is currently permitted under NFL rules and has not been banned.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At the May 20-21 meeting, the reworked proposal fails to secure the required 24 votes from NFL owners, either falling short of the threshold, being tabled again for discussion beyond June 1, or being withdrawn entirely. The play remains legal through June 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At the May 20-21, 2025 meeting, the reworked broader proposal to ban pushing/pulling ball carriers gains sufficient traction. With strong backing from Commissioner Goodell and league officials, enough additional owners flip their position from April, reaching the 24-vote threshold. The NFL officially announces the rule change before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No. The proposal already failed in early April 2025 with only 16 of the required 24 votes - a significant 8-vote shortfall. Converting 8 additional owners in just over a month represents a substantial shift. Factors working against the ban include: the recent failed vote, lack of injury data supporting safety concerns, opposition from teams using the play successfully, and general resistance to mid-course rule changes that might appear to target specific teams' strategies. Factors supporting a potential ban include: explicit support from Commissioner Goodell and the league office (which carries meaningful influence), backing from the Competition Committee and health officials, the reworked proposal framing it as a general principle rather than targeting one play, and the fact the proposal was tabled rather than killed outright, suggesting ongoing momentum. The May 20-21 meeting provides one final opportunity before the deadline. While institutional support from leadership is significant, it doesn't guarantee owner votes. The 8-vote gap is substantial but not insurmountable if leadership applies strong pressure and the reframing resonates. I'm not higher because the recent failure demonstrates clear resistance and the math remains challenging. I'm not lower because there's genuine institutional support, a scheduled meeting before the deadline, and rule changes can occasionally pass when leadership unifies behind them. To revise upward, I'd need evidence of significant owner sentiment shifts or explicit commitments from previously opposed teams. To revise downward, I'd need signals the proposal won't be seriously considered at the May meeting or additional owners stating opposition.",
