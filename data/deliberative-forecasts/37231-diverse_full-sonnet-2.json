    "review": "Both forecasters converged on 85%, slightly lower than my 87%. Their analyses align with mine on the fundamental story: March 2025's 2.2% unemployment is exceptionally strong, and a 0.8+ percentage point jump in one month would be historically unusual outside major crises. We all recognize that tariff impacts typically manifest over months rather than weeks.\n\nHowever, Forecaster 3 raised an important issue I underweighted: **Trading Economics data series uncertainty**. I was implicitly assuming TE mirrors INEGI's official numbers exactly, but there could be differences in seasonally adjusted vs. unadjusted series, reporting lags, or most importantly, rounding conventions. If TE rounds to one decimal and the actual rate is 2.95-2.99%, it displays as 3.0% and resolves No. This adds measurement uncertainty beyond economic uncertainty.\n\nForecaster 3 also emphasized that exactly 3.0% resolves as No (threshold effect), and both forecasters noted the rising underemployment (6.6%) as a potential leading indicator of labor market stress. The concentrated risk in tariff-affected sectors (auto, steel) could theoretically produce faster employment effects than typical.\n\nThese are valid concerns that warrant slightly more caution than my initial 87%. The convergence at 85% by two independent forecasters using similar but complementary reasoning suggests this is the more defensible probability.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm updating down from 87% to 85% for two main reasons:\n\n1. **Measurement/reporting uncertainty**: The resolution depends specifically on what Trading Economics displays, not necessarily INEGI's headline number. If TE uses different rounding, adjustments, or has reporting peculiarities, this introduces uncertainty I initially underweighted. Even if the 'true' rate is 2.9%, certain display conventions could push it to 3.0%.\n\n2. **Appropriate epistemic humility**: When two experienced forecasters independently arrive at the same probability using sound reasoning that addresses factors I didn't fully weight, this is evidence I should update toward their consensus, especially when the difference is modest (2 percentage points).\n\nMy core reasoning remains unchanged: the March 2025 baseline of 2.2% provides substantial buffer, month-to-month unemployment changes are typically small absent major shocks, and tariff employment effects typically lag by months. However, the additional considerations around data reporting and the rising underemployment signal justify slightly greater uncertainty about crossing the 3.0% threshold.",
