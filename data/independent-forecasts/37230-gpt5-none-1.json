    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month (until the final trading day of May 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Slight monthly gain (Yes), consistent with equities’ positive drift and typical monthly up-rate near 55–60%.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Hot inflation prints or a hawkish Fed tone in early May push yields higher; several large-cap earnings disappoint; risk-off move or geopolitical shock drives a negative month-end close vs April.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Inflation data cools or is in line; Fed guidance is steady-to-dovish; earnings broadly beat with constructive guidance; buybacks resume after blackout, supporting equities into late May, finishing above April’s close.",
    "rationale": "Base rates matter most given limited current info. Historically the S&P 500 finishes higher in a given month roughly 58–60% of the time, and May’s seasonality is slightly below average but still modestly positive, not outright negative. With no new assistant data provided, I overweight the status quo: ongoing earnings season tends to produce net-positive surprises, buyback windows reopen through May, and absent shocks, equities exhibit a small upward drift. Countervailing risks keep me from going higher: May often underperforms summer months, valuations are likely elevated after strong multi-year gains, and key catalysts (FOMC early May, CPI/PCE mid-May, jobs data) can move rates and risk appetite. If April ends on a sharp rally at a local high, the hurdle for May to finish higher increases, nudging odds lower; if April closes on weakness, odds would improve. I would raise the probability if: April month-end shows a pullback setting an easier comparison; early May Fed communication is neutral/dovish; inflation data is benign; breadth stays healthy and credit spreads remain tight. I would lower it if: April ends at new highs after a big run; early May data are inflationary; the Fed sounds more hawkish; yields back up materially; or there’s notable geopolitical risk. Given these considerations, I forecast a slight edge to Yes, but not by much.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the S&P 500 index go up in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Times: [What Is a Bear Market? Are We in One?](https://www.nytimes.com/article/bear-market-stocks-tariffs.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if the closing value of the S&P 500 Index on the final trading day of May 2025 is higher than that of the final trading day of April 2025.\n\nThe \"close\" values shown on the [history page of Yahoo finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC) will be used.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
