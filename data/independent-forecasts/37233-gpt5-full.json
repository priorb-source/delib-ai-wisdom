  "information": "In a January 2025 address to the diplomatic corps, President Alassane Ouattara stated he was in 'perfect health and ready to continue serving my country', but clarified that he had 'not yet made a decision' regarding a candidacy in the October 2025 presidential election. He noted that his party, the RHDP, has at least a dozen potential candidates. Previously, in 2020, Ouattara had announced his intention to step down but reversed this decision to run for a third term after the sudden death of his designated successor.\n\nPresident Ouattara's party, the RHDP, has referred to him as its 'natural candidate' and has been calling for him to run since 2024. In late December 2024, Minister of State Anne Désirée Ouloto announced Ouattara would be the candidate. Similarly, in early January 2025, Minister of Transport Amadou KONÉ stated that Ouattara 'will be the candidate of the RHDP in October 2025.' In late April 2025, a supporter group, the Jeunesse pour la Renaissance du Grand Nord (JRGN), held a press conference publicly calling on Ouattara to run.\n\nSeveral key opposition figures face eligibility challenges ahead of the 2025 election. In late April 2025, a court ruled that potential challenger Tidjane Thiam, leader of the PDCI party, was ineligible to run for president due to his French nationality. Former President Laurent Gbagbo was excluded from electoral lists in 2023 following a conviction for embezzlement. Another political figure, Guillaume Soro, remains in exile and is ineligible due to a 2021 conviction; in April 2025, a trial began for his former aide-de-camp for an alleged coup attempt against Ouattara.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until 00:00 on June 1, 2025, local time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ouattara continues to say he has not yet decided and defers any formal declaration until a later RHDP congress or a July/August timetable closer to candidacy filings, maintaining leverage and minimizing early opposition mobilization.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "RHDP holds an extraordinary congress or major rally in May where Ouattara accepts the party’s appeals and formally declares; alternatively, he makes a national address or issues an official party/government communiqué declaring his candidacy before June 1.",
    "rationale": "Key facts from the assistant’s report: (1) In January 2025, Ouattara said he was in good health but had not yet decided to run. (2) Senior RHDP figures have publicly said he will be the candidate (late Dec 2024/early Jan 2025), and pro-Ouattara groups renewed calls in late April 2025. (3) Major opposition figures face eligibility hurdles (Tidjane Thiam ruled ineligible in April; Gbagbo off voter rolls; Soro in exile), lowering the urgency for an early declaration.\n\nBase-rate and incentives: In 2020, Ouattara declared relatively late (August) for the October election. Incumbents often delay formal announcements to retain bargaining power, manage intra-party dynamics, and avoid early mobilization by opponents. Given weakened opposition and no immediate procedural need to declare, the status quo points to no declaration by June 1.\n\nSignals for an earlier-than-usual declaration: Multiple ministers have publicly framed him as the inevitable candidate, and Ouattara’s January remarks emphasized readiness to serve. If RHDP schedules a May congress or communicates a May timetable, a pre–June 1 declaration becomes plausible to consolidate the party and start campaigning.\n\nWhy not higher: There is no direct statement from Ouattara committing to a timeline, and his past pattern—and common practice—favors later declarations. The opposition’s weakened state further reduces pressure for an early move.\n\nWhy not lower: The drumbeat from senior RHDP figures and pro-Ouattara groups, plus his signaling of good health and willingness to continue serving, keep a May declaration on the table, especially if the party wants to lock in unity and fundraising.\n\nWhat would move me up: Official notice of an RHDP congress or major event in May with Ouattara headlining; credible reports that he will address the nation on candidacy; leaks of a prepared campaign rollout before June. What would move me down: Continued statements from Ouattara that he is still consulting, absence of any RHDP May event, or signs of grooming/announcing a successor timeline that pushes a decision into June/July.",
