    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize bureaucratic inertia and the short two‑month window, which I agree are dominant factors. Forecaster 2’s 15% leans on tail risks (terrorism spillover, a single major incident) being sufficient to trigger a rapid upgrade; that’s reasonable but may slightly overweight low‑base‑rate events without specific indicators. Forecaster 3’s argument foregrounds base rates for Level 3 upgrades and the rarity of such changes absent a catalyst; I find this especially persuasive. Neither presents concrete, recent signals of deteriorating conditions, so there’s no new event‑based evidence to move higher.",
    "rationale": "Status quo is Level 2 and has been stable. To hit Level 3 before July 1 would likely require a significant security incident, sustained deterioration, or a major health event—none of which has identifiable momentum right now. The elections timeline (likely October 2025) reduces near‑term political unrest risk. Spillover from Mozambique or a high‑profile attack is possible but not indicated. Given the short horizon and the State Department’s tendency to handle localized risk with regional cautions rather than nationwide upgrades, the base rate for an upgrade in the next ~60 days is low. I’m nudging my estimate down slightly from 12% to 11% to reflect Forecaster 3’s stronger base‑rate emphasis and the absence of specific triggers, while still keeping a nontrivial tail for an unforeseen incident.",
