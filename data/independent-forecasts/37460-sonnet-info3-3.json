  "information": "Turkey's high inflation rate was reported at approximately 48.6% in early 2025. In the legal sphere, an indictment was prepared for 14 youths arrested during the Saraçhane protests, with their first hearing scheduled for May 30, 2025. Separately, the trial for manager Ayşe Barım, related to her alleged role in the 2013 Gezi Park protests, is scheduled for July 7, 2025. Amnesty International's 2024-25 report highlighted what it described as human rights violations in Turkey, including restrictions on peaceful protests and the prosecution of journalists and opposition figures. The organization also condemned the arrests made ahead of the May 1st protests and called for the lifting of the ban on demonstrations in Taksim Square.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - The status quo is that no protest with 10,000+ participants will be reported by the Global Protest Tracker",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Turkey continues suppressing large-scale protests through bans, preemptive arrests, and restrictions. The May 30 hearing and other potential catalyzing events fail to trigger mass mobilization exceeding 10,000 participants. Any protests that do occur remain smaller or are quickly dispersed before reaching the threshold, or are not documented by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The severe economic conditions (48.6% inflation) combined with a catalyzing event - such as the May 30 hearing for arrested Saraçhane protesters, a government action, or another triggering incident - leads to mass demonstrations. Despite government restrictions and bans on key protest locations like Taksim Square, protesters successfully mobilize in numbers exceeding 10,000, and the Global Protest Tracker documents the event.",
    "rationale": "Several factors create tension in this forecast. On one hand, Turkey faces genuinely severe economic conditions with 48.6% inflation, which historically creates conditions for mass protests. There is documented recent protest activity (Saraçhane protests, May 1st demonstrations), and the existence of a Wikipedia article titled '2025 Turkish protests' suggests notable protest activity this year. Upcoming events like the May 30 hearing could serve as rallying points. Turkey also has historical precedent for large-scale protests, particularly the 2013 Gezi Park protests. However, the status quo heavily favors 'No' for several reasons. The government has demonstrated active suppression capabilities through bans (including on Taksim Square demonstrations), preemptive arrests before May 1st protests, and restrictions on peaceful assembly documented by Amnesty International. The Saraçhane protests resulted in only 14 arrests, suggesting relatively small scale. The 10,000+ participant threshold is substantial and requires both successful mass mobilization AND documentation by the Global Protest Tracker - a double hurdle. In repressive environments, most protests fail to reach large scale before being dispersed. With only 55 days remaining, while there's time for a catalyst event, the compressed timeframe limits opportunities. This forecast is not higher because the government's demonstrated capacity and willingness to suppress protests creates significant barriers to mass mobilization. It's not lower because the economic conditions are severe enough to create real grievance-based mobilization potential, and the timeframe provides multiple potential catalyzing events. I would update higher if I saw evidence of growing mobilization campaigns, social media organizing for mass protests, or easing of restrictions. I would update lower if there were reports of increased crackdowns or evidence that recent protests were very small without signs of escalation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 Turkish protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Turkish_protests)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in Turkey (Türkiye) with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nPlease note that the Global Protest Tracker uses the name Türkiye in its database.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nTurkey's high inflation rate was reported at approximately 48.6% in early 2025. In the legal sphere, an indictment was prepared for 14 youths arrested during the Saraçhane protests, with their first hearing scheduled for May 30, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
