    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully emphasizes the exact-phrase constraint and short window, and adds the claim that Musk said he would reduce political involvement in May—if accurate, that slightly lowers odds. However, F2’s baseline seems inflated: calling both Trump and Musk “extremely active on X” overstates Trump’s current X activity (he mostly uses Truth Social), and the “strained Trump–Musk relationship” is largely irrelevant to whether either uses the specific phrase. Given those issues, 18% looks too high. Forecaster 3’s analysis aligns with my base-rate view: the exact phrase requirement and lack of a clear trigger dominate. Their mention of attention to other visa programs (Gold Card, H‑1B) isn’t substantiated by the provided research, but it doesn’t materially change the outlook. Overall, F3’s reasoning is closer to mine; F2 adds a potentially relevant (but unverified) data point about Musk de-emphasizing politics, which nudges downward rather than up.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is short (~40 days). The outcome requires the exact phrase “diversity visa” from @realdonaldtrump or @elonmusk. Trump’s posting on X remains rare, so his contribution to the hazard rate is minimal despite his historical criticism of the program. Musk remains active but has shifted away from politics; even with high volume, he seldom uses this specific term and is more likely to say “visa lottery” or discuss other immigration topics. There’s no visible, imminent trigger (e.g., major controversy, policy action, or court ruling specific to DV) before July 1. A Yes path would likely require a viral DV-related post Musk reacts to or a sudden news spike; absent that, the daily probability remains very low. F2’s suggested political pullback by Musk, if true, slightly lowers odds; other elements in F2’s case don’t raise them. F3’s base-rate framing and emphasis on the exact-phrase filter reinforce my prior. Net: I keep a low forecast and do not update upward.",
