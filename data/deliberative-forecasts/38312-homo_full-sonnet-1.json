    "review": "All three forecasts cluster in the 3-10% range, showing strong consensus that Modi's attendance is highly unlikely. Forecaster 3 makes the most compelling additional point by explicitly framing the timeline as 'logistical impossibility' rather than just 'highly unusual.' This is a stronger constraint than I initially weighted - arranging proper security for a head of state visit in under two weeks isn't merely difficult or against protocol, it's essentially impossible without extraordinary circumstances. Forecaster 2's 10% seems slightly optimistic given this constraint, as diplomatic goodwill alone cannot overcome the physical impossibility of coordinating security, logistics, and protocol in this timeframe. However, I disagree with going as low as 3% because while logistics are binding, they're not absolutely impossible in extreme scenarios - emergency summits have happened with compressed timelines when political stakes are sufficiently high. The real question is whether the political will exists to attempt the impossible, and here the evidence points strongly toward No: Canada's selective invitations to other countries but not India, active domestic opposition from Sikh organizations, and absence of any signals suggesting urgent diplomatic movement all reinforce the status quo outcome.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast downward from 6% to 5%. The 'logistical impossibility' framing from Forecaster 3 is more accurate than my initial 'logistically challenging' characterization. With security, advance teams, protocol arrangements, and bilateral meetings all requiring coordination, organizing a PM visit in 12 days represents not just poor practice but a genuine operational barrier. This constraint is more binding than I initially assessed. However, I'm not going as low as 3% because: (1) diplomatic surprises, while rare, do occur when political stakes are high enough; (2) the Carney-Modi positive messaging, though not yet concrete, leaves a window for unexpected action; (3) rounding to near-zero risks overconfidence when dealing with human decision-making under political pressure. My 5% reflects high confidence in non-attendance while acknowledging irreducible uncertainty about last-minute political decisions. To update further downward, I would need explicit statements from India or Canada ruling out participation. To update upward, I would need an invitation issued within the next 24 hours plus signs of expedited preparations.",
