    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds concrete, new-to-me specifics: BTRC issued two 10‑year licenses on Apr 30 (commercial ops + equipment import), Starlink registered with BIDA on Mar 29, a public trial occurred Apr 9, and officials were targeting a May 2025 launch. Those details materially increase near‑term feasibility and reduce the risk that we’re still pre‑license or stuck at customs/type approval. Forecaster 3 usefully stresses a likely gating item I underweighted: tariff/price approval and commercial enablement (payments/FX/tax), and notes that Starlink typically flips the map to “Available” only when it can accept and ship orders, not merely on legal clearance. F2’s 78% feels a bit high given the need for tariff sign‑off and local payment readiness; F3’s 35% feels too low given the strength of the licensing signals and explicit May targeting plus the ability to operate via ISL without a local gateway. Overall, I find F2’s evidence compelling but discount the probability for execution/administrative slippage highlighted by F3.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~6 weeks. The key update is confirmation of final BTRC licensing and import permission, BIDA registration, and an April trial with a stated May target. Historically, when Starlink has long‑term licenses and political top‑cover, the gap to map “Available” can compress to weeks, especially where ISL removes the need for a local gateway. Those facts move me up from my prior 62%. Countervailing risks keep me short of 70–75%: (1) tariff/price approval by BTRC and taxation setup; (2) enabling local payments/FX in Bangladesh (which has tighter controls than many markets); (3) logistics and customs at scale even with import permission; (4) Starlink’s practice of flipping to “Available” only when immediate orders/shipments can be fulfilled; (5) calendar friction (Eid al‑Adha early June) that can slow administrative steps. The U.S. political inquiry is unlikely to affect Bangladeshi execution before July. Net: the licensing evidence and public May target materially improve odds of a June go‑live and corresponding map update, but the remaining commercial/administrative gating items argue for a modest, not aggressive, upward revision.",
