  "information": "According to multiple independent news sources from April 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker showed significant progress. A Blick.ch report from April 8 stated that 100 out of 302 objectives were completed. A week later, on April 16, a Medium.com article reported the number had risen to 105 completed objectives, with an additional 44 listed as \"in progress\". An earlier report from The Daily Dot on February 25 noted that over 36% of its monitored objectives were implemented. One analysis contained in the reports calculated the historical completion rate at approximately 2.2 objectives per day.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, with the outcome to be determined on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Based on the most recent data, the project is on track to exceed the 120-objective threshold. Extrapolating the completion rate observed between April 8 and April 16 (0.625 objectives/day) projects a final total of approximately 152 completed objectives.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The rate of completing objectives slows dramatically over the next month and a half. This could be because the remaining objectives are more complex, controversial, or face unexpected legislative or legal hurdles, preventing the project from completing the necessary 15 objectives to reach the 120 threshold by the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The rate of completion remains at or near its recently observed pace. The administration, possibly pushing to demonstrate progress, successfully converts a portion of the 44 objectives already 'in progress' to 'Done', easily surpassing the 120-objective mark before July 1.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on a straightforward extrapolation of the most recent, reliable data. As of April 16, 2025, 105 objectives were classified as 'Done'. To reach the threshold of 120 by July 1, an additional 15 objectives must be completed in the 76 days remaining from that date. This requires an average completion rate of approximately 0.2 objectives per day.\n\nThe research indicates that between April 8 (100 done) and April 16 (105 done), the project completed 5 objectives in 8 days, an observed rate of 0.625 objectives per day. This rate is more than three times what is required to meet the target. Projecting this rate forward suggests another ~47 objectives could be completed, for a total of ~152. The presence of 44 objectives already listed as 'in progress' further supports the likelihood that at least 15 will be finalized in the given timeframe.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 90% because rates of progress are not always linear. The earlier, higher completion rates suggested by some reports (e.g., the 2.2/day analysis) compared to the more recent 0.625/day rate indicate a possible slowdown. It's plausible that the 'low-hanging fruit' has been addressed, and the remaining objectives are more difficult. Political friction or unforeseen events could further stall progress.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the required rate is very low (0.2/day) and the project has a significant buffer. Even if the recent completion rate were to be cut in half, the project would still comfortably exceed the 120 objective threshold. To fail, progress would need to grind to a near-halt.\n\nI would increase my forecast if new reports in late May or June showed the completion rate was being maintained or accelerating. I would decrease it if reports showed a significant slowdown, with fewer than 5-6 objectives being completed over the next month.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it is less than 120, this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple independent news sources from April 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker showed significant progress.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
