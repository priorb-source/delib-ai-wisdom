  "information": "According to reports from sources including The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Ars Technica in March 2025, Discord is planning an initial public offering (IPO) for 2025. The company is reportedly in discussions with investment banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase to prepare for a potential listing. While some sources describe the talks as exploratory, others mention the hiring of a new CEO with IPO experience as a signal of late-stage readiness. Discord's valuation was estimated at approximately $15 billion in 2021, and it has over 200 million monthly active users.\n\nDiscord had previously considered going public in 2021 but postponed those plans due to market volatility. That same year, Microsoft offered to acquire Discord for $10 billion, but the company's leadership rejected the offer and a potential IPO was considered as an alternative. Responding to the recent 2025 IPO reports, a Discord spokesperson stated that the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. Discord's revenue is generated through a 'freemium' model, selling subscriptions for premium features.\n\nThe environment for technology IPOs in 2025 is described with mixed signals. Some reports mention a favorable IPO window, noting that other tech firms like CoreWeave, Klarna, and Figma have recently filed to go public. Other reports highlight market volatility, pointing to a recent 7-8.7% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and uncertainty surrounding Fed rate and trade policies as potential headwinds for companies considering a public launch.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discord continues preparations privately, possibly submits or refines a confidential S-1, and waits for a stronger window (late summer/fall). No specific IPO announcement appears on its news blog, and no public S-1 is filed by June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Discord publicly files an S-1 with the SEC in June or posts a specific announcement on its news page stating it plans to go public via IPO in 2025.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: Multiple reputable outlets in March 2025 (NYT, Bloomberg, Ars Technica) reported Discord is preparing an IPO this year, engaging J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs. A leadership move with IPO experience has been interpreted as late-stage readiness. Discord is large (200M+ MAU) and reportedly valued near $15B in 2021. The company previously weighed an IPO in 2021 but delayed. A spokesperson declined to comment on rumors.\n- Market backdrop: The 2025 tech-IPO window is mixed. Some peers reportedly filed recently (CoreWeave, Klarna, Figma), suggesting an open window. Countervailing factors include recent Nasdaq volatility (7–8.7% drawdown) and macro uncertainty that could nudge companies to delay public steps.\n- Resolution mechanics matter: The question resolves Yes only if there is a public S-1 filing or a specific IPO announcement on Discord’s news blog by June 30. Many companies first file confidentially and go public with the S-1 much closer to the roadshow. If Discord targets a fall listing, a public S-1 before July is not necessary and may be unlikely. Summer seasonality also slightly lowers the odds of a public move before July.\n- Status quo weighting: As of May 23, there’s no public S-1 or corporate blog announcement. With ~5.5 weeks left, the base/seasonal pattern and the availability of a confidential filing option make “no public announcement yet” a strong prior.\nWhy not higher: Even if Discord is indeed planning a 2025 IPO, the bar for resolution is a public action (S-1 or explicit blog post). The ability and common practice to file confidentially, plus potential preference for a post-summer roadshow, reduce the probability within this short window.\nWhy not lower: Credible reporting of active bank mandates and 2025 timing, plus signals of IPO readiness and peers moving, keep a nontrivial chance that Discord opts to go public with its S-1 in June or issue a clear planning announcement.\nWhat would move me up: Concrete press reports of a public (not confidential) S-1 imminent; Discord scheduling investor events; a blog teaser about going public; visible stabilization/rally in tech indices; more peers successfully filing/pricing in June.\nWhat would move me down: Fresh market turmoil; credible reporting of a delayed timeline to fall/winter; executive turnover, financing via private rounds, or strategic alternatives (M&A) that obviate a near-term IPO; lack of any listing-related breadcrumbs by mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to reports from sources including The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Ars Technica in March 2025, Discord is planning an initial public offering (IPO) for 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
