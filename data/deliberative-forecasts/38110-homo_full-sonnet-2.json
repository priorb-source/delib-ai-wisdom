    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses are remarkably consistent with my own and reinforce the key factors. All three of us identified the same critical elements: the 20% base rate for 60-day reopenings, the deteriorating security environment per the May 30 AFRICOM briefing, Benin's escalation to Lagos borders on May 9, the lack of diplomatic progress despite Nigeria's House resolution, and the compressed 31-day timeframe. Forecaster 2's slightly higher 15% forecast versus the 12% from Forecaster 3 and myself represents a reasonable disagreement within a narrow range, but their reasoning doesn't introduce new evidence that would shift my assessment. The convergence around 12-15% suggests we're appropriately weighing the evidence. One point worth emphasizing that all analyses captured: we have LESS than half the time window of the 20% base rate (31 days vs 60 days), and the most recent intelligence (May 30) shows deterioration not improvement. This suggests the probability should arguably be below the base rate, not above it.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my initial 12% forecast remains appropriate and well-calibrated. The clustering of all three forecasts between 12-15% with identical reasoning validates the key analytical framework. The critical factors all point in the same direction: (1) Only 31 days remain versus the 60-day window underlying the 20% base rate, (2) The May 30 AFRICOM assessment explicitly noted deteriorating conditions, not improvement, (3) Benin escalated operations to additional borders rather than signaling openness to reopening, (4) Despite economic pressure and Nigeria's legislative resolution, there are zero public signals of progress toward reopening, and (5) The security nature of the closure (terrorism and arms smuggling) historically correlates with extended closures. While I acknowledge non-zero probability due to the possibility of private diplomatic progress or rapid high-level intervention, the complete absence of public indicators combined with recent negative developments justifies remaining at the lower end of the range. I see no compelling reason to update from 12%.",
