    "review": "All three of us independently arrived at 30%, which suggests this is a reasonable anchor given the available information. Forecaster 2 made a valuable point I had underweighted: Keep_Track is a watchdog subreddit known for thorough documentation, which likely means they use rigorous criteria for marking objectives as 'Done' rather than giving credit for superficial progress. This is important context about the source. Both forecasters also appropriately emphasized that we don't know what 'Done' actually means operationally - whether it requires full implementation, substantial progress, or merely initiation. Forecaster 3's calculation of ~22 objectives per month aligns closely with my ~24 per month estimate. The convergence across all three analyses reinforces that the core challenge is the same: achieving 120 completed objectives in roughly 5.5 months requires an aggressive implementation pace that seems difficult but not impossible.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I'm refining my thinking slightly. The point about Keep_Track using rigorous criteria pushes me toward thinking 'Done' likely means substantial or full implementation, not just initiation. This makes 120 completions in 5.5 months more challenging. However, I'm also recognizing that we're all assuming 120 is a high absolute number without knowing the total objective count. If Project 2025 has 500+ objectives tracked and many are already complete, then 120 by July 1st becomes more plausible. The fundamental uncertainty remains: without knowing (1) current baseline, (2) total objectives, and (3) precise 'Done' criteria, we're essentially estimating in a fog. The 46 days remaining provides little room for acceleration. Given the rigorous criteria point from Forecaster 2, I'm inclined to shade slightly lower, but the convergence at 30% and the possibility that simple executive actions could drive progress keeps me from moving far. The timeframe constraint is the strongest factor keeping probability below 35-40%.",
