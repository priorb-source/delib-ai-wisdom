    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite receiving five nominations, Chris Stapleton does not win in any category. This could occur if another artist, such as Luke Combs or Lainey Wilson, has a dominant year and sweeps the major awards, or if voters in each specific category favor a different nominee's work, leading to Stapleton being shut out.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Chris Stapleton wins at least one of the five awards for which he is nominated. Given his consistent critical and commercial success, his work is recognized by the Academy voters in at least one category, which could range from a major award like Male Artist of the Year to a more specific one.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on Chris Stapleton's extensive history of success at the ACM Awards and the significant number of opportunities he has this year. Stapleton is a 17-time ACM Award winner, establishing a strong precedent and demonstrating his high standing within the country music industry. The status quo is that he is a frequent winner when nominated.\n\nThe most critical factor is the five nominations, which provide multiple, independent (to a degree) chances for a win. The probability of being shut out across five separate categories is statistically low for an artist of his caliber. While I lack specifics on the categories and his competition, a simple probabilistic model suggests a high likelihood of a win. For example, if we conservatively estimate his average chance of winning any single category at 30%, the probability of him losing all five is (0.7)^5, which is approximately 17%. This implies an 83% chance of winning at least one award.\n\nMy forecast of 78% is slightly more conservative than this model for a few reasons. First, award show voting is not perfectly independent; a strong narrative around another artist could lead to them winning in multiple categories Stapleton is also nominated in, creating correlated losses. Second, 'voter fatigue' is a plausible factor, where voters may choose to spread recognition to newer or different artists. Finally, the specific field of competitors in each category is unknown and could be exceptionally strong.\n\nHowever, a forecast lower than 70% would understate the advantage that five nominations provide. It is more likely than not that his body of work will be recognized in at least one of these five attempts. I would increase my forecast if I learned some of his nominations were in less competitive, more technical categories. I would decrease my forecast if pre-show buzz and industry sentiment strongly consolidated around a single competing artist, indicating a potential sweep.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chris Stapleton win an award at the 60th Academy of Country Music Awards?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe awards are scheduled to be held on May 8, 2025. Stapleton has 5 nominations.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Chris Stapleton wins an award at the [60th Academy of Country Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/60th_Academy_of_Country_Music_Awards).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
