    "review": "- Useful points from both: the June 17–20 conference is a real catalyst; France’s leadership and Arab coordination raise the short‑term hazard; UK signaling adds momentum. \n- Concerns: Forecaster 2’s specific claim about Malta preparing a June 20 recognition looks incorrect—Malta already recognizes Palestine (since 1988), so it’s not a new recognizer candidate. That weakens their 60% case. \n- Forecaster 3 overweights the UK’s role: the July 4 UK election and caretaker conventions make a June UK recognition very unlikely, so “two P5s in motion” doesn’t translate to a June action window. \n- Both lean high given base rates and Western caution. France is the pivotal actor; absent solid reporting that Paris will announce in June, >60% seems optimistic for a one‑month window.",
    "rationale": "What would have to happen? A new recognizer in June likely comes from: \n- France: most plausible mover. Macron has framed recognition as a moral/political obligation but tied to “conditions” and sequencing; Paris often prefers coordinated timing and might link recognition to progress on ceasefire, hostage/prisoner deals, governance reforms, or post‑conference diplomacy. Still, France could stage a June announcement for maximum impact at the UN conference. I put this around 30% on France alone. \n- Other EU holdouts: Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Italy, Germany. Signals point to caution and preference for coordination; several have domestic/coalition constraints. Small states (Luxembourg/Portugal) may wait for France. Nordics (ex‑Sweden) are unlikely in June. Germany/Italy/Netherlands are very unlikely. \n- UK: joined France’s initiative, but June recognition is constrained by pre‑election caretaker rules. Very low probability this month. \n- Non‑EU OECD (Australia, Canada, Japan, ROK, NZ): all historically cautious and likely to seek allied alignment; no credible June‑timed reporting. \n- Wildcards: a small Pacific or Caribbean holdout could flip, but many non‑recognizers in those regions already moved in 2024; remaining holdouts tend to align with the US and move slowly. \nNetting these: the conference meaningfully raises the probability vs. a normal month, but most plausible candidates either already recognize (e.g., Malta) or face timing/coordination hurdles. I keep the forecast modestly below even odds, with France as the swing. I would move sharply higher on credible reporting of a French June announcement or a mini‑bloc (e.g., France plus one or two small EU states) tied to the conference; I’d move lower if Paris signals post‑conference delay or linkage to conditions unlikely to be met in June.",
