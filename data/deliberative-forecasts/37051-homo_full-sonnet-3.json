    "review": "All three forecasters converge on a very low probability (3-6%), reflecting strong consensus on the fundamental analysis. We all emphasize the same critical barriers: the 67-day timeframe is extraordinarily compressed compared to historical precedent (7+ years for Bob Jones), multiple procedural safeguards exist, no major university has lost status in recent decades, and Harvard's active lawsuit creates additional obstacles. Forecaster 3 raises an interesting counterpoint that IRS leadership chaos might make the agency MORE susceptible to political pressure rather than less capable of action. However, I find this less persuasive because executing a legally defensible revocation of a major university's tax-exempt status requires substantial coordination, documentation, and legal justification - all harder with organizational turmoil, not easier. Forecaster 3's point about the administration's 'willingness to push boundaries' is valid, and their slightly higher 6% forecast reflects this. However, willingness alone doesn't overcome the fundamental constraint: there is no legal mechanism for ultra-fast-track revocation, and courts would almost certainly issue preliminary injunctions. The fact that IRS is 'making plans' is distinct from actually executing and completing a revocation within 67 days.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, I maintain my core reasoning. The binding constraint remains the 67-day timeframe, which is simply insufficient for even an expedited revocation process. While both forecasters appropriately note that unprecedented political circumstances create non-zero risk, none of us identify a credible pathway for completing this action by July 1, 2025. The convergence around 3-6% suggests we're all properly calibrating the tension between: (a) genuine political pressure and reported IRS planning, and (b) overwhelming procedural, legal, and temporal barriers. I considered moving to 3% with Forecaster 2 given their emphasis on 'nearly insurmountable' barriers, or to 5-6% with Forecaster 3 given their emphasis on boundary-pushing. However, I see no new evidence that meaningfully changes the probability calculation. The most likely scenario remains that any revocation process, even if initiated, extends far beyond July 1, 2025, and that courts intervene with injunctions before completion.",
