    "review": "The other forecasters provided critical context that significantly altered my perspective. Forecaster 2's characterization of the delay as being due to sensitive 'data interception guarantees' with discussions at a 'preliminary stage' as of late March is a much stronger negative signal than the 'dashboard system' implementation delay I had initially considered. This reframes the problem from a technical hurdle to a significant political and security negotiation, which aligns better with the fact that the TRCSL's own April 2025 deadline was missed. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the nine-month lag since the initial license was granted effectively highlights the powerful inertia of the status quo and suggests the remaining hurdles are non-trivial. Their mention of other potential logistical delays (type-approval, customs) further strengthens the case for 'No'. Both analyses convincingly argue that the short remaining timeline is insufficient to resolve these complex issues.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward from 45% to 15%. My initial analysis was too optimistic, anchoring on the license being granted and perceiving the reported 'dashboard system' as a manageable, short-term technical delay. The other forecasters' analyses and a reconsideration of the missed April deadline have convinced me that the obstacles are more fundamental. The argument from Forecaster 2, that the core issue is a sensitive data interception negotiation that was still in a 'preliminary stage' two months ago, is the most compelling reason for my update. Such negotiations between a government and a foreign tech company are notoriously slow and complex. Resolving this, plus handling the subsequent regulatory and logistical steps mentioned by Forecaster 3 (approvals, infrastructure, customs), all within the remaining six weeks, is highly improbable. The nine-month period of inaction on the availability map since the license was granted serves as strong evidence that these are not simple issues to resolve. My new forecast of 15% reflects a small chance of a sudden, unexpected political breakthrough, but acknowledges that the overwhelming evidence points towards continued delays beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
