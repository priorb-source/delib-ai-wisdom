    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 provided critical operational details I lacked. The most significant new information: (1) AquaBounty has CEASED all core operations - stopped farming, closed facilities, laid off nearly all staff; (2) Cash plummeted from $9.2m (end-2023) to just $0.23m (Dec 31, 2024); (3) Management issued explicit going-concern warnings; (4) Former CFO stated insufficient liquidity to continue; (5) Capital-raising efforts have failed for over a year. This is far more severe than I initially assessed from market signals alone - this is a company in active wind-down, not merely distressed.\n\nHowever, I find Forecaster 2's 85% too high for one crucial reason: we're now in early May, and despite these dire circumstances being known since at least March 27, no filing has occurred. This delay is meaningful information suggesting either (a) some minimal funding source exists, (b) an asset sale is in progress, or (c) they're pursuing alternatives. Forecaster 3's 57% better accounts for realistic off-ramps while acknowledging severity.\n\nThe low debt-to-equity ratio (0.05) that Forecaster 3 noted is important - minimal secured creditor pressure reduces forced bankruptcy timing. Additionally, with only $0.23m cash 4+ months ago and ongoing expenses, they should theoretically be out of cash already, yet they haven't filed. This suggests some form of interim support or alternative pathway.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast upward from 25% to 60%. My initial assessment relied too heavily on market signals and status quo bias without understanding the operational reality. The combination of operational cessation, near-zero cash position, explicit going-concern warnings, and failed fundraising attempts creates a fundamentally different picture than a distressed-but-operating company.\n\nThe math is stark: $0.23m cash at year-end 2024, now 4+ months later in early May, with even minimal burn rate for skeleton staff and legal/compliance obligations, means they should be effectively out of cash. The natural pathway is bankruptcy filing.\n\nHowever, I'm not going as high as Forecaster 2's 85% because the fact pattern creates a puzzle: if the situation is THIS dire, why hasn't bankruptcy already been filed? The delay from March 27 to May 5 suggests either undisclosed minimal funding, an asset sale negotiation in progress, or pursuit of non-bankruptcy wind-down options. The low leverage (D/E 0.05) means creditors aren't forcing urgent action.\n\nWith 57 days remaining until July 1, there's enough time for: a quick asset sale closing that provides minimal liquidity to avoid bankruptcy; a small bridge loan; or management deciding to file in June/July rather than May. But the window is tight, and absent fresh developments, bankruptcy is the most probable path.\n\nI place my forecast at 60% - acknowledging the severity while accounting for the meaningful fact that filing hasn't occurred despite months of terminal conditions.",
