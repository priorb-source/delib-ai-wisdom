  "information": "Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has stated that her government will permit a citizen-led referendum on independence in 2026 if a public petition gathers sufficient signatures. Smith has personally said she does not support separation but believes the decision should be made by Albertans. To facilitate this process, her government introduced Bill 54, which lowers the threshold for initiating a referendum from 20% to 10% of eligible voters (approximately 177,000 signatures) and extends the time for collection from 90 to 120 days. The government also formed a panel called 'Alberta Next' to explore the province's autonomy and future relationship with the federal government.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Pro-independence groups in Alberta may begin the process of collecting signatures for a citizen-led referendum initiative under the new, more lenient rules. However, the logistical challenge of gathering and verifying approximately 177,000 signatures will take far longer than the time remaining before July 1, 2025. The Alberta government will continue its focus on autonomy within Canada but will not proactively schedule a referendum, and the deadline will pass without an announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and severe political crisis erupts between the Alberta and federal governments, perhaps over a new federal energy policy or a Supreme Court decision seen as hostile to Albertan interests. This sparks a massive, rapid surge in public support for independence. To capitalize on the political momentum and pressure Ottawa, Premier Danielle Smith's government bypasses the citizen-led initiative process and makes a surprise announcement before July 1, 2025, officially scheduling an independence referendum for a future date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the extremely short timeline and the procedural framework established by the Alberta government itself. The July 1, 2025 deadline is less than two months away. The official government policy, as outlined by Premier Smith and supported by legislation like Bill 54, is to permit a citizen-led referendum, not to initiate one unilaterally. This process requires proponents to collect approximately 177,000 signatures. It is logistically infeasible for such a petition drive to be launched, completed, and verified, leading to an official government announcement of a referendum date, all within the next seven weeks. The Premier herself has spoken of a potential referendum in 2026, indicating a much longer timeline is envisioned. Therefore, the status quo strongly points to a 'No' outcome.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 5% because the political environment remains volatile. Premier Smith has demonstrated a willingness to take bold actions to defend provincial autonomy. A 'black swan' event, such as a deeply unpopular federal action that galvanizes separatist sentiment overnight, could theoretically compel the Premier to act decisively and call a referendum to consolidate support and pressure Ottawa, bypassing the standard procedure. The government has already laid the legislative groundwork, making such a pivot possible, if politically risky.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 5% because such a 'black swan' scenario is, by definition, a low-probability event. Absent a major, unforeseen crisis, there is no clear driver that would push the government to deviate from its stated, slower, citizen-led path. Premier Smith has also said she does not personally support separation, making her unlikely to champion a referendum without enormous external pressure. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see evidence of a rapidly escalating federal-provincial conflict or credible information that a separatist group was about to submit a fully verified petition with the required signatures.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith has stated that her government will permit a citizen-led referendum on independence in 2026 if a public petition gathers sufficient signatures.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
