    "review": "Both forecasters sharpened the base-rate framing. The naïve independence math (≈59% with 5 nominees and four shots) is a useful floor. Their correlation caution matches my view, but Forecaster 2 and 3 add a credible offset: at least one category (especially Music Event/Single) is likely stronger than an average 20% shot given the dominance of “I Had Some Help.” That argument nudges the union probability above the naïve baseline. I also agree with their counterweights: strong incumbents (Wilson, Combs, Stapleton, Wallen) and the risk that a crossover narrative leads to an all-or-nothing outcome. Overall, their reasoning is coherent and largely aligned with mine, with the main incremental value being the explicit baseline math and the emphasis that one category could be closer to favorite than coin-flip.",
    "rationale": "I started at 62% on the logic that four nominations yield a >50% chance even with correlated outcomes, and that Malone’s dominant collaboration provides at least one relatively strong path. The deliberation adds two refinements: (1) 59% is a reasonable floor under equal-strength assumptions; (2) category mix likely includes at least one of Music Event/Single/Visual Media, where blockbuster status historically converts at ACMs. Those points justify a modest upward adjustment despite correlation and tough fields. I’m not moving higher because correlation across his entries (same song/era sentiment) and heavyweight rivals make a shutout plausible. Net: slight uptick to reflect at least one near-favorite category while retaining caution on correlation and competition.",
