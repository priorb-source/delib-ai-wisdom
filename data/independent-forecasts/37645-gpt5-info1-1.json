  "information": "Student-led protests demanding the immediate dissolution of parliament and early elections have been ongoing in Serbia for over six months, originating from a tragic canopy collapse in Novi Sad in November 2024. Protestors threatened to escalate their actions if their demands were not met by mid-May. A survey conducted by the CRTA research center indicated that 59% of Serbian citizens support the students' actions. However, reports also suggest that the momentum of the protests has been waning and the political opposition remains fragmented.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement is made by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ruling SNS-led majority swiftly installs a new prime minister after the PM’s resignation, rides out waning protests, and avoids the logistical/political downsides of a mid-summer vote. With a stable majority and fragmented opposition, there is no compelling need to dissolve parliament before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "To defuse protest pressure or capitalize on opposition disarray, the president dissolves parliament and an official election date is set for late July or August (within the 45–60 day legal window), prompting an announcement before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time window and legal timing constraints: Serbian law’s 45–60 day window between calling elections and holding them narrows the pathways to a pre–July 1 announcement. To announce before July 1, authorities would likely be aiming at a late July or August election—dates that are less attractive due to summer turnout and logistics. If they prefer early September, they would need to announce in July, which would miss this question’s cutoff.\n- Status quo weight: The default is to avoid snap polls in a short, inconvenient window, especially when the government controls a parliamentary majority and can nominate a new PM without elections. World changes slowly most of the time, so I overweight the no-announcement baseline.\n- Factors pushing toward “Yes”: Serbia has a history of frequent early elections under President Vučić; the reported PM resignation raises the probability of a reset; protests (with notable public support per the assistant’s summary—CRTA poll showing 59% support) create pressure. If the government sees a tactical advantage in striking while the opposition is fragmented, a quick announcement is plausible.\n- Factors pushing toward “No”: The assistant notes protest momentum is waning and the opposition is fragmented—reducing urgency to concede early elections. The ruling bloc can likely replace the PM without dissolving parliament. International scrutiny after past elections could incentivize reforms/timing that don’t align with a rushed mid-summer vote.\n- Why not higher: The narrow 46-day window plus summer-electoral aversion and the government’s parliamentary control make an immediate announcement less likely.\n- Why not lower: Serbia’s pattern of snap elections, the PM resignation, and protest pressure keep a non-trivial chance of a rapid move.\n- What would move me up: Clear signs the ruling party seeks a late July/August election (e.g., public hints by Vučić or SNS leaders, failure to promptly nominate/confirm a new PM, escalating protests with broad participation, or credible polling showing a peak for SNS encouraging a quick contest).\n- What would move me down: Swift nomination and parliamentary confirmation of a new PM, de-escalation of protests, or explicit statements ruling out summer elections/timing talks suggesting September or later (implying any announcement would come after July 1).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Serbia announce a general election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Serbia could face snap elections as PM’s resignation confirmed](https://tvpworld.com/85681783/serbia-could-face-snap-elections-as-pms-resignation-confirmed-)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a general election will be held is officially announced by the government of Serbia or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nStudent-led protests demanding the immediate dissolution of parliament and early elections have been ongoing in Serbia for over six months, originating from a tragic canopy collapse in Novi Sad in November 2024. Protestors threatened to escalate their actions if their demands were not met by mid-May. A survey conducted by the CRTA research center indicated that 59% of Serbian citizens support the students' actions. However, reports also suggest that the momentum of the protests has been waning and the political opposition remains fragmented.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
