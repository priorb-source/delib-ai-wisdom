  "information": "Data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) indicates that California has the most reported UFO sightings in the US, with 36,286 sightings since 1974. Following California in total sightings are Washington, Florida, Oregon, and New York. NUFORC's public archive shows approximately 100-150 pilot-flagged reports are logged nationwide in a typical year, which averages 8-12 per month. The distribution of these pilot reports is skewed, with California and Florida being the two most common states for such reports, followed by a tier including Arizona, Texas, and Washington. In March 2025, a US Air Force pilot in California reported seeing 'three orange-like lights' hovering above Los Angeles.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, as the outcome will be determined on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "California reports one or more pilot sightings in June 2025, while Florida reports fewer or an equal number. For instance, if both states report one sighting each, the tie results in a 'No' outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Florida has at least one pilot report filed for an event in June 2025, and every other state, including California, has fewer reports. For example, Florida could have one report while all other states have zero.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on historical data from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) and the statistical nature of the event. The research indicates that while Florida is a top state for pilot-reported UFO sightings, California has historically recorded more sightings overall and is also a top contender for pilot reports. The total number of pilot reports nationwide is very low, averaging 8-12 per month. This small sample size introduces a high degree of randomness, meaning any given month's leader could be determined by a single sighting. The decisive factor is the resolution criterion that a tie resolves as 'No'. In a low-number environment, ties are relatively common. For Florida to win, it must have strictly more reports than any other state. California's status as a historical leader in sightings makes it the marginal favorite. Therefore, the status quo points towards a 'No' outcome. My probability is not lower than 25% because Florida is explicitly named as one of the two most common states for pilot reports, making it a very strong challenger. My probability is not higher because of California's strong historical position and, critically, the 'tie resolves as No' rule, which significantly disadvantages the 'Yes' outcome. I would increase my forecast if there were specific information pointing to increased flight operations or unusual atmospheric testing in Florida's airspace scheduled for June 2025. Conversely, I would decrease it if more granular historical data showed California consistently outperforming Florida on a month-to-month basis for pilot reports.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nData from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) indicates that California has the most reported UFO sightings in the US, with 36,286 sightings since 1974.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
