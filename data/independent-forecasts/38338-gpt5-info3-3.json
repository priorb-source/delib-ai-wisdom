  "information": "The field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race has seen recent developments. On June 5, 2025, former Republican Congressman David Jolly announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination. Additionally, State Senator Jason Pizzo has stated his intention to run as an independent. On the Republican side, Congressman Byron Donalds has launched his campaign, and Florida's First Lady, Casey DeSantis, is reportedly considering a run.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 25 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Morgan continues to tease a run, but defers a formal decision until later in the summer or fall, or explicitly says he’s not running yet; he may prefer to run as an independent and sees no need to announce this early.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Morgan decides to capitalize on current attention and announces within the next few weeks via a press event or social media, declaring either a Democratic bid despite Jolly’s entry or an independent run, leveraging his ability to self-fund and set the agenda.",
    "rationale": "With roughly three and a half weeks left, the base case is that he does not announce by July 1. John Morgan has a history of publicly flirting with runs and then waiting or bowing out, and an independent path would not force an early 2025 announcement. The Politico piece (May 15) signals genuine interest and a concrete blueprint, which raises the odds somewhat versus a generic tease. However, the recent entry of David Jolly (June 5) into the Democratic primary reduces the incentive for a quick Democratic announcement, and if Morgan prefers an independent bid, timing pressure before July 2025 is minimal. On the Republican side, Byron Donalds has launched and Casey DeSantis is reportedly considering, but GOP developments don’t materially compress Morgan’s timeline. The world changes slowly: absent a strong signal (event date, filings, staff hires, venue bookings), the status quo favors no announcement within the next 25 days. I’d raise the forecast if credible reports surface of Morgan hiring key campaign staff/consultants in Florida, creating or reactivating a candidate committee, reserving venues or media buys, or circulating internal polls alongside a stated decision window in June. I’d lower it if he reiterates that he’s undecided until later in the year, signals preference for an independent run with no near-term deadline, or publicly praises/defers to Jolly or another candidate.",
