  "information": "Broader labor market indicators suggest a softening trend. A report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed that U.S.-based employers announced 93,816 job cuts in May, which is 47% higher than in May 2024. Separately, the ADP employment report revealed that only 37,000 jobs were created in the private sector in May, the lowest figure in a year. Both the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report and an Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey pointed to weakening conditions, with widespread comments about economic uncertainty delaying new hiring.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days. The initial jobless claims for the week ending June 21, 2025 will typically be reported by the Department of Labor on Thursday, June 26, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Given the softening labor market indicators, the status quo suggests initial jobless claims are on an upward trajectory and likely to approach or exceed the 220,000 threshold. If claims are currently near historical moderate levels (200,000-215,000), continued deterioration would push them above 220,000.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The labor market stabilizes despite warning signs. Companies respond to economic uncertainty by freezing hiring rather than conducting layoffs. The elevated job cut announcements don't translate into immediate unemployment claims, either due to severance periods, internal transfers, or delayed implementation. Initial jobless claims remain in the 200,000-220,000 range.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The labor market softening accelerates. The 93,816 job cuts announced in May begin to materialize as actual layoffs in June. Economic uncertainty causes additional companies to reduce headcount. Weak private sector hiring (only 37,000 jobs in May) means fewer opportunities for displaced workers. These factors combine to push initial jobless claims above 220,000 for the week ending June 21.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report provides multiple converging indicators of labor market deterioration: job cut announcements up 47% year-over-year, historically weak private sector job creation at just 37,000 in May, and both the Federal Reserve Beige Book and ISM survey documenting widespread economic uncertainty and hiring delays. These are forward-looking indicators that typically precede increases in jobless claims with a lag of several weeks. The 220,000 threshold sits at the boundary between a healthy and concerning labor market - it's neither extremely low nor extremely high. The key uncertainty is that I don't have the current baseline level of initial jobless claims. If they're currently around 210,000-215,000, the deteriorating trend could easily push them above 220,000 within 2-3 weeks. However, if they're currently below 200,000, it would require a more significant acceleration. Labor markets typically change gradually, which argues for modest probability adjustments from the status quo. My forecast is not higher because: (1) there's uncertainty about the current baseline, (2) there's often a lag between announced job cuts and actual claims, (3) only 2-3 weeks remain, which may not be enough time for a dramatic shift, and (4) some economic indicators can give false signals. My forecast is not lower because: (1) multiple independent sources confirm the softening trend, (2) the magnitude of changes (47% increase in job cuts, lowest hiring in a year) is substantial, (3) the threshold of 220,000 is moderate and achievable given current trends. I would update higher if: current claims data showed levels already at 215,000+, or major layoff announcements occur in the next two weeks. I would update lower if: current claims data showed levels below 200,000, or positive economic data emerged suggesting the softening is temporary.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 exceed 220,000?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer. The claim requests a determination of basic eligibility for the Unemployment Insurance program.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 is greater than 220,000 according to [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA).&#x20;\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBroader labor market indicators suggest a softening trend.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
