    "review": "Forecaster 2 contributes useful specifics (303 lbs; best-by Feb 21/23/25; vending machines in WA; possible Class II). Those details, if accurate from the FSIS page, strengthen the case for a relatively quick closure given the highly perishable product and very limited scope. I also agree with their point about a weekend cutoff risk. I’m a bit cautious about the “Class II” label since undeclared fish is often Class I, but either way the operational implications here (small, short shelf-life, limited distribution) are favorable for closure by late May.\nForecaster 3’s caution about status quo (still Active as of May 8) and government update cadence is valid; administrative lag can easily push an otherwise-complete recall closure into early June, which would resolve No. However, I think 34% underweights the small scale, perishable nature, and that we’ll be ~95–100 days post-posting by end of May—timing that often sees closure for contained allergen/misbranding recalls.\nNet: Forecaster 2’s concrete details keep me modestly above even odds; Forecaster 3’s emphasis on lag nudges me down slightly from my prior.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~3 weeks. The product volume appears small and the affected items expired in late February, making on-the-ground recovery/disposition straightforward. Distribution was limited to WA vending machines, likely through one or a few operators, which simplifies effectiveness checks. No illnesses and company-initiated discovery further support a clean close once documentation is complete.\nCountervailing factors are the current Active status and the real possibility that FSIS administrative closure lands in early June rather than May, especially if staff prioritize higher-risk or larger recalls. The weekend cutoff heightens that risk.\nBalancing these, I still see better-than-even odds of a May closure, but I trim my estimate slightly to reflect the administrative-lag risk with only ~24 days left.\nChange from prior: down a few points (from 63% to 59%) due to the lack of any visible progress signal as of May 8 and acknowledging the update cadence risk highlighted by Forecaster 3.",
