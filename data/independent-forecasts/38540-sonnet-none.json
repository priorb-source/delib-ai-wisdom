    "status_quo_outcome": "Without current leaderboard data, the status quo is uncertain. However, given the very short time horizon of 16 days, whatever position OpenAI holds today is highly likely to persist until July 1st, as major model releases and significant ranking changes are unlikely in such a brief window.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "OpenAI is currently ranked #2 or lower on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard, with competitors like Anthropic's Claude series, Google's Gemini models, or other advanced models holding the top position. No significant model update or performance improvement occurs in the remaining 16 days to change this ranking.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "OpenAI currently holds the #1 position on the leaderboard with models like GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, or potentially GPT-5, and maintains this position through July 1st. Alternatively, OpenAI could be tied for #1 with another model, which would also satisfy the resolution criteria since ties count as #1.",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces significant epistemic uncertainty due to the lack of current leaderboard data. The research assistant provided no information about the present standings as of June 15, 2025. Key considerations: (1) Time horizon: With only 16 days until resolution, the status quo is paramount - major ranking shifts are unlikely in this window unless a surprise model release occurs. (2) Historical context: Through early 2024, OpenAI maintained strong competitive positions with GPT-4 variants, but faced intense competition from Anthropic's Claude 3 series and Google's Gemini models. (3) The 'ties count' provision increases the probability somewhat, as OpenAI could share #1 rather than exclusively hold it. (4) OpenAI has substantial resources, talent, and a track record of frontier model development. (5) However, the competitive landscape has intensified significantly, with multiple well-resourced competitors. Without knowing whether OpenAI currently holds #1, I'm forecasting under maximum uncertainty. The very short time horizon means the current state will likely persist. Given OpenAI's historical strength and resources, I place the probability slightly above 50%. My forecast would increase significantly if I learned OpenAI currently holds #1 (to 85%+) or decrease substantially if learning they're currently #2 or lower (to 20-30%). A surprise model release by any competitor in the next 16 days could also shift probabilities.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill an OpenAI model be ranked #1 overall on the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard at the end of the 2nd Quarter of 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMethodology: [Chatbot Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating LLMs by Human Preference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04132)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a model owned by OpenAI is in the number 1 overall rank (ties count) at the [Chatbot Arena Leaderboard](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this is not the case, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nScroll down to Arena Overview and the resolution is based on the \"overall\" rank.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
