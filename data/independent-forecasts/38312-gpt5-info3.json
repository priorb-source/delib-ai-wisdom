  "information": "Sikh organizations in Canada, including the 'Sikh Federation' and the 'World Sikh Organization', have publicly demanded that the Canadian government not invite Prime Minister Modi to the G7 summit. They have cited the Indian government's alleged involvement in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and other human rights concerns. In a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney, the World Sikh Organization of Canada stated that inviting the Indian Prime Minister would be an 'irresponsible decision' and would signal that Canada is willing to ignore foreign interference.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–4 weeks (the G7 leaders’ summit is in June 2025; the outcome will be known by the summit dates).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of early June there is reportedly no invitation for India; absent a late change, Modi will not attend in person.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Canada does not include India among outreach invitees, amid bilateral tensions and domestic political pressure; alternatively, a late invitation is issued but Modi declines or sends a representative, so he does not appear in person.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Canada, nudged by other G7 members or after a bilateral thaw, issues a late invitation; India accepts and Modi travels to Canada and participates in the outreach sessions in person.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: India has been invited to most recent G7 summits and Modi often attends in person (2022, 2023, 2024), reflecting India’s growing strategic role. That would normally favor a Yes. Host-specific factors: Canada is chair in 2025 and bilateral relations are strained by the Nijjar case and broader accusations of interference. This is a material headwind relative to other hosts. Timing: As of June 3, media reports indicate Canada has invited Australia and Ukraine but not India yet. With the summit weeks away, logistics and security needs make a new invite increasingly unlikely. Research assistant input: Sikh organizations in Canada publicly urged the Canadian government (in a letter reportedly addressed to PM Mark Carney) not to invite Modi, citing the Nijjar killing and human-rights concerns. If accurate, that underscores domestic political costs to inviting Modi and lowers the odds further. Why not higher: No invitation reported this late, Canada–India tensions, and visible domestic opposition in Canada reduce the chance of both invitation and acceptance. Why not lower: G7 often seeks India’s participation for Indo-Pacific and global economic discussions; other G7 members may push for India’s inclusion, and a late diplomatic accommodation is possible. What would move me up: Credible reports that an invitation has been extended to India; signals of a bilateral thaw; Indian government travel preparations or public scheduling hints. What would move me down: Official confirmation that India is not on the invite list; clear Indian statements ruling out travel; any escalation in Canada–India tensions or security concerns that would preclude attendance. Note: A virtual appearance would not satisfy the in-person criterion; only physical attendance counts.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill India's PM Narendra Modi attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of India: [Canada invites Australia, Ukraine for G7 meet but no call for India yet](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-invites-australia-ukraine-for-g7-meet-but-no-call-for-india-yet/articleshow/121398906.cms)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSikh organizations in Canada, including the 'Sikh Federation' and the 'World Sikh Organization', have publicly demanded that the Canadian government not invite Prime Minister Modi to the G7 summit.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
