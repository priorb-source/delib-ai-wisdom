  "information": "According to reports in mid-April 2025 from sources including uol.com.br and Sports.ru, Johnny Walker was scheduled to fight the undefeated Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316 on June 7-8 in Newark, New Jersey. At the time of the announcement, Murzakanov held a professional record of 14-0 and was noted for winning three of his four UFC bouts by knockout or technical knockout. He was returning from an 180-day suspension for an anti-doping violation, which was set to end on May 1, 2025. Walker's record was cited as 21-9, and he was entering the fight on a two-fight losing streak.\n\nMultiple news outlets, including RotoWire on May 6, 2025, and MMA Fighting on May 9, 2025, reported that Johnny Walker had withdrawn from his scheduled bout against Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316. The reason provided for the withdrawal was an injury. Walker's official Wikipedia page was also updated to reflect his withdrawal from the event.\n\nFollowing Johnny Walker's withdrawal, it was announced that Azamat Murzakanov would remain on the UFC 316 card against a new opponent. As reported by MMA Fighting and Championat.com around May 7-9, 2025, Brendson Ribeiro was signed as the replacement fighter. Ribeiro entered the fight with a professional record of 15-7. The updated UFC 316 bout sheet officially listed the light heavyweight clash as Azamat Murzakanov vs. Brendson Ribeiro.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12-13 days until UFC 316 takes place on June 7-8, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Johnny Walker will not fight Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Walker remains withdrawn from UFC 316 due to injury and Murzakanov fights Brendson Ribeiro as currently scheduled. This is the current status quo and what is officially on the UFC 316 card.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Walker makes an unexpected recovery from injury, gets medically cleared, Brendson Ribeiro is removed from the fight for some reason, Walker is reinstated to face Murzakanov, and then Walker wins the fight. This would require multiple unlikely events to occur in sequence.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report makes it clear that Johnny Walker has already withdrawn from this bout due to injury, with the withdrawal announced in early May 2025. A replacement fighter, Brendson Ribeiro, has been officially signed and the UFC 316 bout sheet has been updated to reflect Murzakanov vs. Ribeiro. With only 12-13 days until the event, the status quo is firmly established. For a YES outcome, we would need: (1) Walker to recover from injury, (2) medical clearance, (3) UFC to reverse the replacement decision and remove Ribeiro from the card, (4) Walker to be reinstated against Murzakanov, and (5) Walker to actually win the fight. Each of these steps is individually unlikely, and their combined probability is extremely low. There are no reports suggesting Walker is close to recovery or that the UFC is reconsidering the matchup. The event is too close for such major card changes absent extraordinary circumstances. My forecast is not 0% only because theoretically Ribeiro could withdraw and Walker could be available as a last-minute replacement, but even then Walker would need to win. It's not lower because complete certainty is rarely warranted. It's not higher because the status quo is clear and the timeframe makes reversal extremely improbable.",
