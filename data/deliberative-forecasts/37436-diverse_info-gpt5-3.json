    "review": "Both forecasters rightly emphasize how low the threshold is (only 5 more deaths) and how dangerous conditions remain. Forecaster 2’s “even at a quarter of recent pace we still cross 300” is a compelling way to frame it; that strengthens the case versus my initial 70%. I’m less convinced by Forecaster 3’s use of an 18‑month average (16–17/month), which likely overstates the current hazard because fatalities were front‑loaded in late 2023. Both appropriately flag ceasefire/de‑escalation and the key reporting risk: if OCHA stops posting snapshots, the count could freeze at 295. I put somewhat more weight than Forecaster 2 on those risks (posting cadence, verification lags, operational pullbacks), so 90% feels too high, but their trend argument warrants nudging my probability up.",
    "rationale": "Baseline is 295 as of Apr 30. We need 5 by the final snapshot before Jul 1. The implicit required rate is ~0.08/day over ~62 days. Recent observed increments were ~15 over 42 days (~0.36/day) from Mar 19 to Apr 30; even at a sharply reduced pace (≤25% of that), we’d still expect ≥5. The May 5 indication of intensified Israeli operations raises hazard for UN staff, and most fatalities are UNRWA local staff who remain in Gaza even if operations are curtailed, so exposure persists. Key downside risks: (1) reporting mechanics—nontrivial chance OCHA posts no further snapshot before Jul 1 or delays updating the UN staff figure; (2) a ceasefire/major de‑escalation or staff withdrawals reducing exposure; (3) verification lags causing undercount in time for the final pre‑July snapshot. I weight these combined at roughly 20–25%. Given the very low threshold and recent trend, I increase my forecast but stay below the 80s/90s to reflect posting/verification and de‑escalation risks.",
