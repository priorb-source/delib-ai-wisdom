  "information": "Recent polling data shows a shift in voter support in Quebec. Bloc Québécois support has declined from 37% to a range of 23-27%. Conservative support has remained stable at approximately 23%. The Liberal Party has seen its support surge to between 40-42%. Aggregated polls from sources like Nanos, CROP, Abacus Data, and Ipsos show the Bloc leading the Conservatives by 5 to 17 percentage points province-wide.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The 2025 Canadian federal election must be held by October 2025 at the latest, approximately 5-6 months from now, though it could be called sooner.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo based on current polling strongly suggests a Yes outcome. The Bloc Québécois is polling at 23-27% in Quebec while the Conservatives are at approximately 23%, giving the Bloc a 5-17 percentage point lead across multiple polling aggregators.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Conservatives surge in Quebec to overtake the Bloc in popular support, or the geographic distribution of votes heavily favors Conservative seat efficiency. This could happen if Conservative momentum builds nationally and spills into Quebec, or if the Bloc's vote becomes inefficiently distributed while Conservative support concentrates in winnable ridings.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Bloc maintains its current 5-17 point polling lead over Conservatives in Quebec and converts this to more seats. Given the Bloc's concentrated support base in Quebec and historical efficiency at converting votes to seats in the province, even their current diminished support level (down from 37% to 23-27%) would likely translate to more seats than the Conservatives' 23%.",
    "rationale": "The polling evidence strongly favors a Yes outcome. Multiple aggregated polls from Nanos, CROP, Abacus Data, and Ipsos consistently show the Bloc leading Conservatives by 5-17 percentage points in Quebec. While the Bloc has lost significant ground due to Mark Carney's Liberal surge (dropping from 37% to 23-27%), they retain a meaningful advantage over the Conservatives. Crucially, the Bloc's support is geographically concentrated in Quebec, making them more efficient at converting votes to seats compared to the Conservatives whose Quebec support is more diffuse. The article notes that in Quebec City, a Conservative candidate cannot run, directly benefitting the Bloc. The status quo principle suggests this polling advantage should persist absent major developments. I'm not forecasting higher because: (1) the Bloc has experienced significant erosion; (2) several months remain before the election allowing for shifts; (3) the Conservative Party has shown stability at 23% and could potentially grow. I'm not forecasting lower because: (1) the Bloc maintains a clear, consistent polling lead across multiple sources; (2) their Quebec-focused strategy and concentrated support gives them structural advantages in seat conversion; (3) the Conservative candidate issue provides a concrete advantage. I would revise upward if polls show the Bloc extending their lead or Conservatives falling, and downward if the gap narrows to under 5 points or Conservatives show momentum.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Bloc Québécois win more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Carney’s Surge in Quebec Could Wipe the Sovereigntist Party Off the Map](https://thewalrus.ca/carneys-surge-in-quebec-could-wipe-the-sovereigntist-party-off-the-map/) | [In Quebec City, a Conservative candidate cannot run and the Bloc is benefitting](https://nationalpost.com/news/in-quebec-city-a-conservative-candidate-cannot-run-and-the-bloc-is-benefitting)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Bloc Québécois party wins more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party of Canada in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election). If it wins the same or fewer seats, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nRecent polling data shows a shift in voter support in Quebec.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
