  "information": "Beyond Meat's financial results for the first quarter of 2025 showed a 9.1% year-over-year decline in net revenues to $68.7 million. The company reported a net loss of $52.9 million and a gross loss of $1.1 million, resulting in a gross margin of -1.5%. While the company's international business revenue grew, its U.S. retail channel revenue fell by 15.4%. Citing weak consumer demand and macroeconomic volatility, Beyond Meat withdrew its annual sales forecast for 2025 and issued a revised outlook for the second quarter with expected net revenues between $80 million and $85 million.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month and 23 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Despite severe financial distress, companies generally do not file for bankruptcy in any given short-term period. The status quo is continued operation while attempting to navigate financial challenges.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beyond Meat manages its existing cash reserves and credit facilities to sustain operations past the July 1, 2025 deadline. Cost-cutting measures and operational adjustments prove sufficient to delay or avert a liquidity crisis within this short timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The company's high cash burn rate, exacerbated by negative gross margins and declining revenue, depletes its liquid assets faster than anticipated. A covenant breach or the inability to secure further financing triggers an acute liquidity crisis, forcing a Chapter 11 filing to restructure its debts and operations.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant financial distress reported by the company, balanced against the very short timeframe for the question. The status quo for any company is to not file for bankruptcy, which serves as my baseline. However, the information provided indicates a company in deep trouble. The Q1 2025 results are alarming: a 9.1% revenue decline, a substantial net loss of $52.9 million, and, most critically, a negative gross margin of -1.5%. Selling products at a loss before even accounting for operational expenses is fundamentally unsustainable and accelerates cash burn. Furthermore, withdrawing the annual sales forecast signals extreme uncertainty and a lack of visibility from management, which increases the risk of a sudden negative event. The probability is not higher because bankruptcy is a drastic final step, and management likely has some remaining cash reserves and levers to pull to survive for another ~50 days. The short timeframe makes it more likely they can last until the deadline. My forecast is not lower because the financial metrics, particularly the negative gross margin and withdrawal of guidance, are classic indicators of a company at high risk of insolvency. A sudden liquidity crunch or a strategic decision to enter restructuring proceedings is a tangible possibility. I would increase the probability given news of a failed capital raise, a major credit line being pulled, or an announcement of an exploration of 'strategic alternatives'. I would decrease the probability upon news of a successful financing round or a major new retail partnership that could credibly reverse revenue declines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beyond Meat file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeyond Meat has had several years of losses and in the most recent quarter it [posted](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial) a loss from operations of almost $38 million.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Beyond Meat, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBeyond Meat's financial results for the first quarter of 2025 showed a 9.1% year-over-year decline in net revenues to $68.7 million.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
