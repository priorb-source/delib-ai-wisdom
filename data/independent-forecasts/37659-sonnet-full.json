  "information": "According to multiple independent news sources from April 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker showed significant progress. A Blick.ch report from April 8 stated that 100 out of 302 objectives were completed. A week later, on April 16, a Medium.com article reported the number had risen to 105 completed objectives, with an additional 44 listed as \"in progress\". An earlier report from The Daily Dot on February 25 noted that over 36% of its monitored objectives were implemented. One analysis contained in the reports calculated the historical completion rate at approximately 2.2 objectives per day.\n\nProject 2025 is a 922-page strategic document authored by the Heritage Foundation. Its stated aims include restructuring the US government and shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Specific objectives mentioned in news reports include dismantling the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), removing funding for the United Nations Human Rights Council and the W.H.O., allowing political appointees to personally authorize appropriated funding, reducing education programs, and imposing higher tariffs on imports from various countries.\n\nThe Project 2025 Tracker is a public website created by Redditors from the r/Keep_Track subreddit, with Adrienne Cobb identified as its creator. The site monitors and visually demonstrates the progress of the administration's initiatives based on the Project 2025 plan, breaking down the status of objectives by government agency. According to an April 2025 report, the tracker website was attracting between 50,000 and 100,000 visitors daily, with approximately 10% of the traffic originating from outside the United States.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days from today (May 16, 2025) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - if current trends continue, the tracker will exceed 120 objectives by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The completion rate dramatically slows to below 0.2 objectives per day, the tracker stops being maintained or updated, or there's a significant change in classification methodology that reclassifies completed objectives back to incomplete status",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The tracker continues operating normally with completion rates remaining at even a fraction of historical levels. With 105 objectives already done as of April 16 and 44 in progress, even a modest rate of 0.3-0.5 objectives per day would easily surpass 120 by July 1",
    "rationale": "Starting from the most recent data point: 105 objectives were completed as of April 16, 2025. To reach 120 by July 1 requires only 15 additional completions over approximately 76 days, yielding a required rate of just 0.2 objectives per day. The historical data shows much higher rates: from April 8 to April 16, the rate was 0.625 objectives per day (5 completions in 8 days). Even if we assume continued deceleration, the completion rate would need to drop by over two-thirds from recent levels to miss the threshold. Additionally, 44 objectives were listed as 'in progress' on April 16, providing a substantial pipeline. The extremely low bar needed (15 completions in 76 days) combined with historical performance makes the Yes outcome highly probable. My forecast is not higher (approaching 90-95%) because: (1) tracker maintenance could be discontinued, (2) classification criteria might change, (3) rates could decelerate more dramatically than expected, (4) we're relying on data that's now 30 days old. My forecast is not lower because the mathematical threshold is so modest that even pessimistic scenarios about deceleration would likely still clear 120. I would update higher with confirmation of current objective counts showing continued progress, or update lower if evidence emerged of tracker abandonment or dramatically slower rates.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it is less than 120, this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple independent news sources from April 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker showed significant progress.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
