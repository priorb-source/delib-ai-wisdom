  "information": "The White House has officially confirmed that President Donald Trump will attend the G7 summit in Canada from June 15-17, 2025. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that details of the visit would be announced shortly. Numerous media outlets reported the confirmation in late May 2025, and official G7 participant lists dated June 3 include Trump.\n\nThe 51st G7 Summit is scheduled to take place in Kananaskis, Alberta. Security measures are being implemented, including a controlled access zone around summit venues from June 10-18 and temporary airspace restrictions. In advance of the leaders' summit, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell attended preparatory G7 meetings in Banff. Historically, sitting U.S. presidents have attended every in-person G7/G8 summit since its inception in 1975.\n\nAccording to reports from the Nikkei newspaper, the upcoming G7 summit may not produce a traditional final joint statement due to disagreements between the U.S. and other member nations. The summit may instead result in several separate documents on specific topics of cooperation, while excluding more contentious issues like global trade and relations with Russia from the formal agenda to avoid conflict. In preparation for the summit, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House on June 5.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12–14 days (G7 leaders’ summit is June 15–17, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — President Trump attends in person as scheduled.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A late cancellation or substitution (e.g., health issue, domestic/emergency crisis, security threat, or deliberate diplomatic snub) leads him to remain in the U.S. or participate only virtually, or he dispatches a surrogate instead.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Air Force One arrives in Alberta and Trump physically joins at least one leaders’ session or photo-op where he is in the same room as other heads of state.",
    "rationale": "Evidence strongly favors attendance. The White House has publicly confirmed Trump’s participation for June 15–17 in Kananaskis, and media and official participant lists (dated June 3) include him. Canada has already implemented extensive security and airspace restrictions around the venue. U.S. principals (Treasury Secretary Bessent and Fed Chair Powell) have attended advance G7 meetings in Banff, consistent with normal summit choreography. Historically, U.S. presidents attend G7/G8 in person; exceptions are rare and typically tied to extraordinary circumstances (e.g., 2020 pandemic disruptions). Planned bilateral engagement (e.g., Scholz at the White House on June 5) signals standard pre-summit diplomacy rather than disengagement.\n\nWhy not higher? Trump has a history of abrupt schedule changes (e.g., skipping the 2018 Summit of the Americas; canceling 2019 Davos), and the time-to-event leaves room for shocks: sudden domestic or international crises, health issues, aircraft or weather disruptions, or a tactical decision to protest disagreements (reports suggest potential friction over joint statements). Any of these could still trigger a no-show or a downgrade to virtual/Surrogate attendance.\n\nWhy not lower? Multiple converging indicators—formal White House confirmation, inclusion on official lists, detailed host-country security posture, and the strong base rate for G7 attendance—substantially reduce the likelihood of a last-minute reversal. The political costs of skipping the G7 are nontrivial, and the venue/security plans look locked in.\n\nWhat would move me up? Pool reports showing a firm travel schedule (departure times), Air Force One wheels-up to Calgary, bilateral schedules in Kananaskis, or confirmed arrival on site. What would move me down? Credible reporting of reconsideration, a declared domestic emergency, notable health concerns, security alerts affecting Kananaskis, or announcements that a surrogate (e.g., VP/Secretary of State) will represent the U.S., or that Trump will participate only virtually.",
