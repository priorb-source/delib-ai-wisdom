  "information": "The University of Michigan's final Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) for May 2025 was 52.2, the same as the final reading for April. This followed a decline from 64.7 in February and 57.0 in March, marking a nearly 30% drop since January. The index's components also declined in April, with the Current Economic Conditions Index falling to 59.8 and the Economic Expectations Index dropping to 47.3. Consumers' short-term (one-year) inflation expectations reported in the survey rose to 6.5% in April, the highest since November 1981, while long-term inflation expectations increased to 4.4%. Historically, from 2010 to 2019, index increases of 8 points or more in a single month occurred less than 3% of the time.\n\nAccording to ADP data, U.S. private-sector hiring slowed significantly in May 2025, with only 37,000 jobs added, the slowest pace in over two years. Job losses were noted in business services, manufacturing, and education. A separate University of Michigan survey shows consumers expect unemployment to climb. Data on consumer behavior shows personal spending rose by 0.2% last month, while the savings rate increased to 4.9% in March, the highest level in nearly a year. Following the end of the pandemic-era payment pause on student loans, delinquencies jumped from 1% to 7.74%. In contrast to the University of Michigan's findings, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 98 in May from 85.7 in the prior month.\n\nThe ongoing trade war with China is a frequently cited source of uncertainty for American consumers, with the U.S. having doubled steel tariffs. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller has outlined a potential path to interest rate cuts later in the year, but noted that considerable uncertainty remains around the level of tariffs. Waller also largely dismissed the high inflation expectations recorded in the University of Michigan survey, stating a preference for market-based measures and professional forecasts.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks. The report is expected on the last Friday of June 2025, which is June 27, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The final May 2025 reading was 52.2, a significant distance from the 60.0 threshold. The trend has been sharply negative since January, and a continuation of this trajectory would keep the index well below 60.0.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Consumer anxiety persists, driven by high inflation expectations, slowing job growth as evidenced by recent ADP data, and ongoing trade policy uncertainty. In this scenario, the sentiment index remains stagnant near its May level or declines further, resolving the question as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant positive economic shock occurs, such as a much stronger-than-expected official May jobs report, a sudden drop in energy prices, or a major de-escalation in trade tensions. This shock would need to be powerful enough to cause a rapid reverse in sentiment and drive an 8+ point jump in the index from its May level, an event historical data shows is rare.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards a 'No' outcome, primarily based on the current level of the index and its recent downward momentum. The May 2025 final reading was 52.2, meaning the index would need to surge by nearly 8 points to exceed 60.0. Historically, single-month increases of this magnitude are rare, occurring less than 3% of the time between 2010 and 2019. The underlying economic data supports continued weakness in consumer sentiment. Key drivers for the UMich index, such as inflation expectations, are currently a major source of concern for consumers, with one-year expectations at multi-decade highs. Furthermore, recent ADP data showed a significant slowdown in private-sector hiring, and consumers' own expectations for unemployment are rising. This suggests that the labor market, a traditional pillar of strength, may be weakening, further eroding confidence. While the Conference Board's confidence index showed a surprising increase, that survey is often more sensitive to the labor market, whereas the UMich survey is more reactive to personal financial situations and inflation, which are the current points of stress. The weak ADP report may be a leading indicator that the Conference Board's optimism is misplaced. My probability is not lower than 15% because the index is already at a low level, and acknowledge the conflicting data from the Conference Board, which suggests some resilience. A surprisingly strong official jobs report could provide a short-term boost. My probability is not higher because a nearly 8-point jump is a historically high bar to clear, and the current weight of evidence from inflation expectations and the jobs market points firmly in the other direction. I would increase my forecast if there were a sudden, sharp drop in gasoline prices or a major positive resolution to the ongoing trade disputes.",
