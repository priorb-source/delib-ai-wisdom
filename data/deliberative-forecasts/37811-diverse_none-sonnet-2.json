    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I underweighted in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes the extremely high base rate for major government websites remaining online over a one-month period - likely >99% under normal circumstances. Forecaster 3 provides crucial historical context from 2017-2021 showing that even during deliberate climate data removals, primary domains persisted. Most importantly, Forecaster 3 identifies that resolution occurs 'on or after July 1,' not precisely on that date, which significantly reduces risk from transient outages. Both note we're several months into the administration without signals of Climate.gov removal, which is meaningful evidence against imminent action. However, I find Forecaster 2's 98% slightly overconfident given: (1) the documented political interest in removing climate information, (2) single-source resolution mechanism uncertainty that Forecaster 3 highlights, and (3) the fact that while domains persisted 2017-2021, content was altered, suggesting ongoing vulnerability. Forecaster 3's 94% appropriately balances the strong base rate arguments with these non-zero risk factors.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating significantly upward from 87% to 95%. The key factors driving this update are: (1) Base rate dominance - major government websites almost never go completely offline in a one-month window; (2) Resolution timing flexibility - 'on or after July 1' means brief outages won't trigger a No; (3) Historical precedent - domains persisted through 2017-2021 climate data changes; (4) Time elapsed - several months into administration without removal signals reduces urgency risk; (5) Institutional inertia - NOAA is a large operational agency where domain removal requires extensive coordination. I'm not going as high as 98% because: (1) The National Security Archive report documents active climate information removal efforts; (2) Single-source uptime verification introduces measurement uncertainty; (3) Domain persistence during content changes doesn't guarantee immunity from more aggressive action; (4) Six weeks still provides sufficient time for a deliberate policy decision to remove the site. My 95% forecast represents strong confidence in the status quo while acknowledging documented political risks and resolution mechanism limitations.",
