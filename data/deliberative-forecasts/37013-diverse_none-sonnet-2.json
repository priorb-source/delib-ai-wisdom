    "review": "I made a critical factual error in my initial analysis. I incorrectly stated that the Liberal Democrats were the incumbent largest party on Cornwall Council. Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 correctly note that the Conservatives won a commanding majority in 2021 with 47 of 87 seats, while the Liberal Democrats secured only 13 seats, placing them in third. This completely undermines my status quo baseline and incumbency advantage arguments. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the sheer scale of the deficit - a 34-seat gap is enormous to overcome in one electoral cycle. Forecaster 3 provides valuable context about the dramatic national swing against Conservatives since 2021 and specifically in the South West, including the 2024 general election results. Forecaster 3's point that winning a plurality (not majority) in a fragmented multi-party field may require only high-20s to low-30s seats is important. The truth likely lies between these two analyses - the Conservative collapse is real, but starting from such a deficit makes it genuinely uncertain whether Lib Dems can become the largest party or if the result will be a fragmented council with Conservatives still in plurality, or even strong Independent performance preventing either major party from being largest.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 70% was based on a fundamental factual error about the 2021 results. Correcting this error requires a substantial downward revision. However, I should not simply adopt Forecaster 2's pessimistic view. Key considerations: (1) The national Conservative decline since 2021 has been historic, with 2024 local elections showing massive losses; (2) The South West specifically has seen strong Conservative-to-Liberal Democrat swings; (3) Cornwall has a tradition of Liberal Democrat local strength that may have been temporarily suppressed in 2021; (4) In a fragmented field with strong Independents, the threshold to be 'largest party' is lower than winning a majority. Against this: (1) The 13-to-47 starting deficit is massive; (2) Independents winning seats may prevent either major party from being largest; (3) No local polling confirms the swing is sufficient. Balancing these factors, I believe the probability is higher than Forecaster 2's 25% but lower than Forecaster 3's 54%, settling around 40%.",
