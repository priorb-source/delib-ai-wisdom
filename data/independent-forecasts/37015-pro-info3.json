  "information": "In multiple public statements and interviews with news outlets such as the Financial Times and Yonhap in late April 2025, Han Duck-soo has consistently maintained that he 'has not yet decided' on a presidential run. His stated immediate priority is the US-South Korea trade negotiations scheduled for April 24. No visible campaign infrastructure or preparations for a presidential bid have been observed.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "13 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han Duck-soo completes the US-South Korea trade negotiations and continues to focus on his duties as Acting President, allowing the May 5, 2025 deadline to pass without making any formal announcement of a presidential candidacy.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Spurred by a successful outcome in the trade negotiations on April 24 and yielding to intensified pressure from the People Power Party, Han Duck-soo makes a surprise announcement in late April or early May declaring his intention to run for president.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the current lack of tangible evidence supporting an imminent campaign announcement. The research assistant's report is critical here: as of April 22, with only 13 days remaining, Han Duck-soo has not established any visible campaign infrastructure, which is a significant logistical hurdle for a serious presidential bid. His public statements indicate indecision and a focus on his current governmental duties, specifically the upcoming trade negotiations. This aligns with the status quo, where he is not a candidate. The world tends to change slowly, and the foundational steps for a presidential run have not been taken. The primary evidence for a 'Yes' outcome is the reported pressure from his party. While this pressure is a real factor, it is an external influence and does not guarantee his personal decision to run, especially on such a compressed timeline. My probability is not lower than 15% because political situations can be volatile. A highly successful trade negotiation could create significant political momentum, and the party's desire to draft him could culminate in a sudden, high-pressure situation where he feels compelled to announce. My probability is not higher because the logistical and operational realities of launching a campaign are substantial. The absence of any preparatory work this close to the deadline makes an announcement highly improbable. I would increase my forecast if credible reports emerge of him hiring campaign staff, meeting with major party fundraisers, or forming an exploratory committee. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if he makes a more definitive statement ruling out a run or if the trade talks falter, damaging his political standing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Han Duck-soo announce his candidacy for South Korean president before May 5, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Chosun Daily: [Support grows in PPP to draft Acting President Han for June election](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464554)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Han Duck-soo announces his candidacy for president of South Korea before May 5, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn multiple public statements and interviews with news outlets such as the Financial Times and Yonhap in late April 2025, Han Duck-soo has consistently maintained that he 'has not yet decided' on a presidential run. His stated immediate priority is the US-South Korea trade negotiations scheduled for April 24. No visible campaign infrastructure or preparations for a presidential bid have been observed.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
