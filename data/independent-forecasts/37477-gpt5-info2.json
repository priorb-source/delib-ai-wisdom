  "information": "The Wall Street Journal's editorial board described a trade deal with the United Kingdom as a step towards unwinding the trade war, writing that the economic damage from tariffs was proving politically risky. The board also has stated that the tariff policy has shaken global confidence in U.S. reliability and called it a 'true gift' to Chinese President Xi Jinping. In April 2025, President Trump suggested tariffs could replace income taxes, a claim that a Wall Street Journal reporter noted reasons to be skeptical of. Following the implementation of tariffs, the Treasury Department raised its borrowing projection for the April-June 2025 quarter to an estimated net marketable borrowing of $514 billion.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 23 days (last eligible date is May 31, 2025; resolution known June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "From now through May 31, at least one of the two print front pages (NYT or WSJ) contains the word “tariff” or “tariffs” every eligible publication day, so there is never a same-day omission on both.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On at least one remaining publication day before June 1, both the NYT and WSJ print front pages omit the word “tariff”/“tariffs” entirely.",
    "rationale": "Framing: The condition requires just one day where both front pages omit “tariff(s).” As of today (May 9), the criteria have not yet been satisfied, implying zero such days since the open date (likely around Apr 14, 2025, given the WSJ link format). That’s informative about the daily “success” rate so far. Using a simple Bayesian hazard approach: if we treat each eligible day as a Bernoulli trial and we’ve seen ~0 successes over roughly two to three weeks of eligible days (≈20–22 WSJ publication days), a Beta-Binomial posterior predictive yields a baseline chance of getting at least one success in the remaining ≈20 eligible days of about m/(n+1+m) ≈ 20/(22+1+20) ≈ 47%. Adjustments: - Downward pressure: The research assistant’s notes indicate elevated tariff salience in April–May 2025 (Trump’s suggestion that tariffs could replace income taxes; Treasury’s higher borrowing projection post-tariffs; WSJ editorial focus). This likely keeps “tariff(s)” on WSJ A1 frequently, and NYT front pages often mirror major national policy narratives. Also, the word can appear anywhere on A1 (not just headlines), increasing hit probability. WSJ publishes no Sunday edition, reducing eligible joint-opportunity days. - Upward pressure: News cycles can be crowded (geopolitics, domestic policy, courts, markets, disasters). It only takes one day of simultaneous omission. Even hot-button topics can drop off A1 for a day when overshadowed by other events. Netting these, I trim the naive ~45–47% posterior-predictive probability down modestly to 40%, reflecting the elevated tariff-centric coverage since mid-April and the requirement that both papers omit the word on the same day. Why not higher: Because “tariff(s)” has been front-page-relevant nearly continuously in this window, and the WSJ in particular is prone to include the term in A1 copy or summaries. Why not lower: Because only one clean day is needed, and front pages can pivot quickly if other major stories dominate. What would move me up: Evidence of even a single day where one paper omits the term (showing the hazard isn’t near-zero), signals that tariff coverage is ebbing (e.g., a lull in policy announcements/retaliatory actions), or back-to-back A1s without tariff mentions in one paper. What would move me down: Fresh, scheduled tariff announcements or escalations (new broad-based tariff package, major retaliation by trading partners), or observation that both A1s continue to feature tariffs nearly daily over the next week, indicating the daily omission probability remains very low.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff(s)\" disappear from the front print pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal by June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\n\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. When, if ever, will we seen tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve to \"Yes\" if, after \\[OPEN DATE] and before June 1, 2025, the words, \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\", do not appear on the print front page of The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. The following URLs will be used to resolve the question:\n\n* The New York Times: [https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper](https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper)\n* Wall Street Journal:\t [https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250414/frontpage](https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250414/frontpage)\n\n***\n\n<sup>Note: WSJ front page URL for April 14, 2025. Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\nGrammar is not relevant (e.g. \"TARIFF\" will suffice to prevent a \"No\" resolution).\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, it does not have to be in a title.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Wall Street Journal's editorial board described a trade deal with the United Kingdom as a step towards unwinding the trade war, writing that the economic damage from tariffs was proving politically risky.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
