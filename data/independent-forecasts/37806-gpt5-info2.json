  "information": "Since taking office in January 2025, the Trump administration has taken numerous actions on immigration. As of February 17, 2025, the administration had issued 62 executive orders, including ones to end Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates, an order to end birthright citizenship for children of unauthorized immigrants, and a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border. Other relevant policies implemented include a new rule requiring non-citizens to carry proof of legal status at all times, visa restrictions on Indian travel agencies accused of facilitating illegal immigration, and a policy to limit visas for foreign officials who facilitate irregular migration.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 42 days (≈6 weeks)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The White House continues issuing immigration-related actions focused on border enforcement, parole limits, and visa vetting, but none mention the exact phrase “Diversity Visa.” Alternatively, an action discusses the program using the formal term “Diversity Immigrant Visa,” which would not count under the question’s wording requirement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The President issues a proclamation or executive order targeting or pausing the Diversity Visa lottery or urging Congress to abolish it, and the text explicitly uses the exact words “Diversity Visa,” published on the presidential actions page before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: To date, no presidential action in 2025 has mentioned the Diversity Visa program by that exact phrase. The administration’s immigration actions have focused on border measures, enforcement, and broad visa restrictions, per the research assistant’s summary, but not DV-specific changes. With only ~6 weeks left, the default is No. \n- Wording constraint lowers odds: Official documents often use “Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) program.” The requirement for the exact phrase “Diversity Visa” makes a qualifying hit less likely even if the program is referenced. \n- Reasons for some probability mass: Trump has a history of criticizing the DV lottery and previously sought to end it. A fresh immigration package, a symbolic action keyed to DV-2026 results, or a high-salience incident could prompt a targeted proclamation/EO that names “Diversity Visa” explicitly. The administration is prolific with immigration actions, marginally raising the chance of a match by July 1. \n- Why not higher: Narrow time window; competing priorities (border, asylum, parole); legal/operational complexities of altering a congressionally created program via presidential action; and the exact-phrase requirement. \n- Why not lower: The administration is active on immigration and rhetorically hostile to the DV lottery; a signaling document that explicitly says “Diversity Visa” is plausible. \n- Update signals upward: Leaked draft EO/Proclamation targeting DV, WH talking points or press briefings specifically naming “Diversity Visa,” or a scheduled immigration policy rollout referencing the lottery. \n- Update signals downward: Continued focus on border and parole policies without mention of DV through mid-June; legislative-only pushes that omit presidential actions; or references that consistently use “Diversity Immigrant Visa” in recent documents.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSince taking office in January 2025, the Trump administration has taken numerous actions on immigration. As of February 17, 2025, the administration had issued 62 executive orders, including ones to end Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) mandates, an order to end birthright citizenship for children of unauthorized immigrants, and a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
