    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2 emphasizes that chemical contaminants are 'logistically simpler' than microbiological issues - this is an important distinction I underweighted. Forecaster 3 provides useful base rate information (1-4 months typical, with 95 days being near the midpoint) that suggests my 4-6 month estimate may have been too pessimistic. Both correctly note Cargill's size, experience, and strong incentives for rapid resolution. However, I find Forecaster 2's 75% too optimistic given: (a) the recall has already been active 40 days without closure, suggesting some complexity; (b) government verification processes have inherent delays; (c) we have no information about current progress. Forecaster 3's 62% better balances the competing considerations and explicitly accounts for status quo uncertainty and administrative lag risk. The key insight I missed was properly categorizing this as a chemical contamination case, which typically resolves faster than pathogen outbreaks.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was likely too pessimistic in my initial forecast. The evidence points toward updating upward: (1) Chemical contamination recalls do tend to resolve faster than pathogen cases because the source is identifiable and remediation is more straightforward; (2) The 95-day total window (March 28 to July 1) falls well within the 1-4 month typical range for FSIS recalls; (3) Cargill's resources and institutional capacity make rapid resolution more likely; (4) I overweighted the 'already 40 days active' observation without considering this is still early-to-mid timeline for such recalls. However, I remain cautious about going too high because: (a) we lack any information about actual progress toward closure; (b) FSIS verification processes can be thorough and time-consuming; (c) the recall remaining active after 40 days suggests it's not a trivial case; (d) administrative processes can lag. Balancing these factors, I'm updating significantly upward but staying below Forecaster 2's optimistic 75% and closer to Forecaster 3's more measured 62%.",
