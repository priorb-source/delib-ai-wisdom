    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses are highly convergent with mine, all landing in the 87-90% range. This convergence strengthens my confidence in the core reasoning. Forecaster 3 raises a particularly valuable point I hadn't explicitly considered: even if the site is redirected to an EPA page or archive, it would likely still register as UP for IsItDownRightNow resolution purposes. This makes the Yes outcome even more robust than I initially modeled. Both forecasters appropriately balance the bureaucratic/legal barriers against the small but real risk of aggressive political pressure for a symbolic takedown. Forecaster 3's observation about the 2026 savings timeline is also helpful - it suggests implementation over months rather than weeks, reinforcing the timeline constraints. The specific update conditions Forecaster 3 provides (DNS changes, 404/410 errors, official notices) are exactly the right evidence to monitor. I find no significant gaps or errors in either analysis.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating slightly upward from 87% to 89%. The key insight driving this update is Forecaster 3's point about redirects: if Energy Star is eliminated but the EPA implements a redirect from energystar.gov to an archive or notice page, this would still resolve as Yes according to IsItDownRightNow. This scenario is more likely than a complete domain takedown and adds robustness to the Yes outcome. The convergence of all three forecasts in this narrow range (87-90%) validates the core reasoning: bureaucratic procedures, NARA/FOIA requirements, historical precedent from 2017, and the extremely short 48-day timeline all create formidable barriers to a complete website takedown. The Forecaster 3 observation about 2026 savings targets suggesting slower rollout further supports this timeline analysis. I'm not moving to 90% because the documented intent to eliminate the program and potential for aggressive political pressure as a symbolic action remain meaningful risks, albeit small ones. The 11% No probability appropriately captures these tail scenarios including emergency procedures, transient outages, or unprecedented rapid action.",
