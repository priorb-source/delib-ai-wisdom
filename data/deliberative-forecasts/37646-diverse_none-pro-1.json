    "review": "My initial forecast was overly pessimistic, anchored heavily on the 18-month delay since the license announcement and the power of the status quo. The other two forecasters provided crucial context that I had not sufficiently weighed. Forecaster 2 correctly identified that Somalia presents unique security and infrastructure challenges, providing a plausible explanation for the delay. More importantly, Forecaster 3 introduced two powerful arguments that fundamentally shifted my perspective: 1) a base rate for Starlink activation, suggesting that service often goes live within 2-8 weeks of final approvals, making the remaining 6.5-week window entirely plausible; and 2) the technical reality that inter-satellite links (ISLs) obviate the need for local ground stations, significantly reducing on-the-ground logistical hurdles. This reframes the 18-month delay not as a sign of an intractable problem, but as the time needed to navigate complex, non-technical issues (regulatory, commercial, security) which may now be resolved. Their reasoning was highly convincing because it was grounded in specific operational patterns and technical capabilities of Starlink, offering a better model for what might be happening behind the scenes.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast upwards from 35% to 55%. My initial reasoning was flawed by underweighting Starlink's ability to activate service rapidly once bureaucratic and commercial hurdles are cleared. The arguments from the other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 3's points on activation base rates (2-8 weeks) and the role of inter-satellite links, have convinced me that the long delay is more likely attributable to a now-concluded preliminary phase of complex negotiations rather than an ongoing roadblock. The technical readiness for service is high. With Elon Musk's personal announcement signaling corporate priority and a 6.5-week window that fits the typical activation timeline, the probability of a 'Yes' outcome is much higher than I first estimated. I am not going as high as Forecaster 3's 60% because the 18-month delay is still exceptionally long compared to other countries, suggesting that Somalia's unique security and governance challenges pose a real and persistent risk of last-minute hitches. Therefore, my updated forecast of 55% reflects a belief that activation is now more likely than not, while still respecting the significant, country-specific risks that could push the launch just past the July 1st deadline.",
