    "review": "The other forecasters and I have converged on a similar range (18-28%), which increases my confidence in this general assessment. All three of us recognize the key tension: Trump's documented opposition to the program versus the strong 4+ month pattern of not using the phrase 'Diversity Visa' in any presidential action despite 62+ executive orders on immigration. \n\nForecaster 3 makes an important point I underweighted: Trump could issue a memorandum directing agency implementation or imposing restrictions within existing statutory frameworks while mentioning 'Diversity Visa' - this would resolve as YES without requiring elimination of the program. This is a more plausible pathway than attempting to end the program entirely via executive action.\n\nHowever, I'm also persuaded by the legal team consideration both forecasters emphasized: after 4+ months in office with intense focus on immigration, the absence of any mention is highly informative. If there were a viable and desired executive action pathway that used this terminology, they likely would have taken it by now. The SAFE Act legislative approach appears to be the deliberate strategy.\n\nForecaster 2's slightly higher forecast (28%) seems to place more weight on remaining opportunistic moments, but I think the established pattern deserves more weight. The May 3 lottery results release has already passed without triggering action, which is further evidence against.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm moderately updating upward from 18% to 22%. The key insight from this deliberation is recognizing that Trump doesn't need to attempt eliminating the program to satisfy the resolution criteria - a memorandum directing implementation changes, expressing policy priorities, or coordinating with congressional efforts could all mention 'Diversity Visa' and resolve as YES.\n\nHowever, the 4+ month pattern remains the strongest piece of evidence. Trump has issued over 40 immigration-related presidential actions without once using this phrase. This suggests either: (1) they're deliberately avoiding this terminology in favor of terms like 'visa lottery', (2) they prefer the legislative path and see no value in executive action, or (3) legal advisors have determined there's no beneficial executive action that wouldn't be immediately challenged and struck down.\n\nWith 42 days remaining, there's still time, but each passing day without action strengthens the status quo. The modest upward adjustment acknowledges the memorandum/directive pathway while maintaining that the established pattern is highly informative about administration priorities and legal strategy.",
