  "information": "Historically, of the approximately 50 novel bat coronaviruses described in scientific literature since 2000, only SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have produced confirmed human cases within a year of their first description. The rate of publicly reported accidental laboratory infections for such viruses is also low, estimated at approximately one per decade worldwide.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 45 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No human cases reported; question resolves as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "HKU5-CoV-2 remains confined to its natural animal reservoir with no spillover events occurring in the next 45 days, and no laboratory accidents occur during this brief window",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A natural zoonotic spillover event occurs from animal-to-human contact, or a laboratory handling the virus experiences an accidental exposure incident that results in human infection, with the case being detected and reported by credible health authorities before July 1, 2025",
    "rationale": "The extremely short timeframe of 45 days is the dominant factor in this forecast. My research assistant's data shows that of approximately 50 novel bat coronaviruses described since 2000, only 2 (4%) produced confirmed human cases within a year of first description. With only 1.5 months remaining versus a full year, this base rate needs to be proportionally reduced to approximately 0.5%. Laboratory accidents represent another potential pathway, but at roughly one per decade worldwide for such viruses, this translates to an extremely low probability over a 45-day window (less than 0.01%). The status quo strongly favors no human cases - most novel coronaviruses never infect humans, and those that do typically require specific receptor compatibility and sustained contact opportunities. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of: (1) active human surveillance detecting early cases, (2) known high-risk exposures already under investigation, or (3) laboratory work with the virus being conducted at scale. For it to move lower, I would need confirmation that the virus has inherent biological barriers to human infection or that all samples are under stringent biosafety protocols. The combination of the very short remaining timeframe and low historical base rates drives this probability down significantly, though I maintain a small non-zero probability given that spillover events, while rare, can occur unpredictably.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be any human cases of the novel coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Discovery of HKU5-CoV-2, a Novel Coronavirus in China](https://assure-test.com/discovery-of-hku5-cov-2-a-novel-coronavirus-in-china/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there are any human cases reported anywhere globally of HKU5-CoV-2.\n\nQuestion resolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), especially the World Health Organization or US Centers for Disease Control.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorically, of the approximately 50 novel bat coronaviruses described in scientific literature since 2000, only SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have produced confirmed human cases within a year of their first description. The rate of publicly reported accidental laboratory infections for such viruses is also low, estimated at approximately one per decade worldwide.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
