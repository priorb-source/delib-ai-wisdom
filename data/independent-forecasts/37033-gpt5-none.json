    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No additional payment is made before June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following the April 9 first tranche, the government pauses further disbursements pending financing arrangements or administrative processing, pushing the next tranche to later in Q3 or tying it to a larger bond/IFC-backed structure. FX constraints or prioritization of other fiscal pressures delay action, and no credible report of another payment appears before June 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "To signal commitment to creditors and re-engagement, the government executes another small USD tranche (e.g., a few million) to eligible former farmers in May, reported by credible outlets or official statements, possibly as part of a nascent monthly/bi-monthly schedule under the Global Compensation Deed.",
    "rationale": "Time is short, but the signaling incentives are real. Zimbabwe reportedly made its first compensation payment of about USD 3.1m on April 9, 2025. The government has recently reaffirmed its commitment to compensation within a broader debt-resolution narrative, which raises the chance of follow-on payments to demonstrate progress to international partners. However, history and capacity constraints argue for caution: prior pledges have often outpaced execution; FX shortages are chronic; and the Global Compensation Deed implies a large multi-year burden that has struggled to gain firm financing. With only ~5–6 weeks left, a second payment likely requires either a pre-set (e.g., monthly) cadence already in motion or a deliberate decision to make another symbolic tranche before early June. I put extra weight on the status quo that things move slowly in Zimbabwe’s fiscal apparatus and that the first payment may have been a one-off signal rather than the start of an immediate monthly program. This keeps the base case slightly tilted to No. It’s not lower because the recent payment indicates the administrative pathway exists and authorities are courting creditors; a modest follow-up disbursement to sustain momentum is plausible. It’s not higher because we lack evidence of a formal schedule, and liquidity constraints could easily defer action beyond June 1. What would move me up: credible reporting of a planned schedule (e.g., monthly tranches), confirmation of secured financing dedicated to near-term payments, or official statements committing to another disbursement by end-May. What would move me down: reports of delays, legal or administrative snags, or acute FX stress crowding out discretionary USD payments. The research assistant provided no additional information beyond the cited articles; thus, the forecast leans on recent reporting, Zimbabwe’s track record, and timing constraints.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Zimbabwe, before June 1, 2025, make another payment to white farmers whose property was seized?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Zimbabwe reaffirms commitment to land compensation to spur growth, debt sustainability](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/04/10/zimbabwe-reaffirms-commitment-to-land-compensation-to-spur-growth-debt-sustainability)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) the government of Zimbabwe after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 makes an additional payment to former farmers covered under the 2020 Global Compensation Deed.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, Zimbabwe [was reported](https://nehandaradio.com/2025/04/09/zimbabwe-pays-us3-1m-to-former-white-farmers-as-part-of-land-compensation-deal/) to have made its first compensation payment, of USD $3.1 million. Additional such disbursements made after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 would count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
