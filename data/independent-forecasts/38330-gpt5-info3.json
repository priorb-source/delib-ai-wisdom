  "information": "The term 'reverse' is used in various financial contexts. A New York Fed statement on June 3, 2025, noted that its System Open Market Account (SOMA) net income could be impacted by interest expenses on 'reverse repurchase agreements.' On June 3, 2025, the Mexican government announced it had saved 12 billion pesos in the purchase of medicines through a 'reverse auction mechanism.' Additionally, the company Worldline launched a cash tender offer for its bonds on June 4, 2025, using a 'reverse book-building procedure.'",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (NYT mention window Jun 10–Jun 30, 2025; outcome known July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "NYT continues covering finance, China, and markets without ever using the exact phrases “reverse purchasing” or “reverse purchase” in any story dated Jun 10–30, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "NYT runs a piece that either: (a) covers the Chinese “reverse purchasing” phenomenon and adopts that exact translation, or (b) an editor/writer unusually phrases something as “reverse purchase,” e.g., describing a transaction or policy in exactly those words, leading to an exact-string match in the NYT search.",
    "rationale": "The bar is an exact-phrase match in a narrow 21-day window (Jun 10–30). The phrases “reverse purchasing” and “reverse purchase” are uncommon in NYT style. In finance, the prevalent term is “reverse repurchase (agreement)” or “reverse repo,” which will not match the search. Procurement/market stories typically say “reverse auction” or “tender offer/buyback,” not “reverse purchase.” The People’s Daily item could spark coverage of a trend, but NYT would more likely use alternatives like “reverse shopping” or explain the concept without adopting the precise term. Base rate for NYT using this exact wording in any short window is extremely low. The research assistant’s notes reinforce this: recent relevant items involve “reverse repurchase,” “reverse auction,” and “reverse book-building” — close but not exact. Why not higher: very low historical usage and a short time window. Why not lower: small tail risk that a China-trend piece quotes or translates the term verbatim, or an odd phrasing in a business article yields “reverse purchase.” I would raise the forecast if: I see the term gaining traction in English-language outlets, a wire story using “reverse purchasing” that NYT republishes, or NYT previews on China consumption trends adopting that translation. I would lower it further if: by mid-June there’s no sign of the phrase in major Anglophone coverage of China retail trends, and finance coverage remains strictly “reverse repo/auction.”",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the New York Times mention \"reverse purchasing\" before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPeople's Daily: [“Reverse purchasing” reflects the vitality of the Chinese market](http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2025/0430/c1004-40471159.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the NY Times mentions \"reverse purchasing\" in any of its content items as found through [this search](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchasing%22&sort=best), dated after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
