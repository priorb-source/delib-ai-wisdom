    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the status quo and short window, highlighting the lack of concrete signals (FEC filing, staff hires, donor activity) and O’Rourke’s conditional language. I agree with these as key bearish factors. New (or at least additive) points they surfaced: the weight of three recent losses potentially making him more cautious, and the general point that major launches usually show precursors. I didn’t hear decisive new evidence that would push me up. My earlier point about announcement timing relative to fundraising quarters (incentive to wait until July 1 to start a clean Q3) remains a strong reason against a pre–July 1 launch, and neither forecaster rebutted it. Their ranges (25–28%) cluster near my 24%, suggesting broad alignment rather than a reason to shift materially.",
    "rationale": "Time left is ~40 days, and the status quo is No. Announcing just before a quarter ends is suboptimal, and high-name-recognition candidates often delay when there’s no filing pressure (Texas primary filing typically opens in November). There are no visible telltales of an imminent rollout. Reasons for a June surprise exist—DSCC coordination, a desire to shape/freeze the field, or leveraging a news event—but absent signals (staffing, vendor moves, FEC activity, sourced reporting), those are tail scenarios. The incentive to launch on/after July 1 to maximize an opening quarter haul is a concrete structural nudge against a June announcement. I therefore keep a low-but-not-negligible probability. I would move up on credible reports of staff hires, media reservations, donor meetings signaling an imminent launch, or an FEC filing. I would move down if late June passes quietly or if O’Rourke publicly indicates a later decision timeline.",
