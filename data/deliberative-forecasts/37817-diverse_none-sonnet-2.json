    "review": "Forecaster 2 presents critical empirical information that neither I nor Forecaster 3 considered: they claim to have checked the actual resolution source (flightsfrom.com) and found 6 current destinations already listed. This is a game-changing data point if accurate. The specific list (Taipei, Manila, Guam, Brisbane, Port Moresby, and Nauru, with airport codes) suggests genuine research rather than speculation. Forecaster 3 and I both worked from market fundamentals and the negative framing of the background article, but neither of us checked the actual current status. If Forecaster 2 is correct, the entire framing shifts from 'will new routes be added?' to 'will any current routes be canceled in the next 6 weeks?' - a much more stable scenario. However, I note some uncertainty: (a) I cannot independently verify this claim, (b) flightsfrom.com listings might include seasonal routes that don't operate continuously, (c) the background article about slow recovery and economic stress makes route cancellations plausible, especially for thinner routes like Nauru or Port Moresby served by smaller carriers. Forecaster 2's 20% cancellation risk seems reasonable but perhaps slightly optimistic given the economic headwinds described.",
    "rationale": "I am updating significantly upward based on Forecaster 2's claimed observation of 6 current destinations. If accurate, the status quo is already YES and inertia strongly favors continuation through July 1. International route cancellations with only 6 weeks notice are uncommon absent major shocks. The main risk is that one of the more marginal routes (likely Nauru or Port Moresby operated by smaller regional carriers) could be suspended due to the economic pressures highlighted in the background article. I'm somewhat more conservative than Forecaster 2's 80% because: (1) I cannot verify the data myself, (2) the background article specifically mentions slow recovery and low flight volumes, which could make some routes vulnerable, (3) listings on flight aggregators can sometimes be stale or include technically scheduled but unviable routes. However, I'm much higher than my original 30% or Forecaster 3's 20%, both of which incorrectly assumed we needed route additions rather than just maintenance of status quo.",
