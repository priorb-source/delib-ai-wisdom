    "review": "Both forecasters present similar core reasoning to mine, with Forecaster 3 at 25% and Forecaster 2 matching my 18%. The key disagreement centers on how much weight to give the 'existing political infrastructure' advantage versus the complete absence of preparation signals. Forecaster 3 makes a compelling point that Casey DeSantis, as First Lady with existing networks and donor relationships, could launch faster than a typical candidate. They also note that Governor DeSantis hasn't endorsed anyone, potentially 'leaving the door open.' However, I find the complete silence on campaign preparation particularly telling. In modern politics, major announcements typically have leaks - exploratory committees, staff rumors, trial balloons in the media. We've seen none of these. Additionally, while both forecasters note the House probe, I think we should weight this more heavily as a timing factor. Announcing during an active investigation would be politically risky and seems likely to push any decision past July 1. The Trump endorsement of Donalds is also a massive headwind in GOP primary politics that makes entry less attractive.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm making a modest upward adjustment from 18% to 20%. Forecaster 3's point about existing political infrastructure is well-taken - as First Lady, Casey DeSantis has immediate access to networks, donors, and organizational capacity that could enable a faster launch than I initially weighted. The June 30 fundraising deadline remains a genuine catalyst just 25 days away. However, I'm not moving all the way to 25% because the core evidence still strongly favors NO: (1) The complete absence of any preparation signals - no staff rumors, no exploratory committee news, no leaked conversations - is highly informative in the modern media environment; (2) The House probe into Hope Florida creates significant political risk for announcing during active scrutiny; (3) Trump's endorsement of Donalds fundamentally changes the race dynamics in ways that make entry less attractive; (4) Her 'We'll see' responses read more like disinterest than strategic positioning. While 26 days allows for a surprise entry, the combination of zero visible preparation plus active negative scrutiny makes this unlikely.",
