    "review": "The other forecasters make compelling arguments that closely align with my initial analysis. However, Forecaster 3 raises a critical distinction I should weight more heavily: the difference between exercises that simulate blockades versus actual blockades. The resolution criteria requires the US to accuse China of 'blockading' - meaning actual interdiction of maritime traffic to Taiwan's seaports, not merely conducting exercises that rehearse such scenarios. This is a significantly higher bar than I initially weighted. Currently, China is conducting exercises that US officials acknowledge as blockade rehearsals, but there's no evidence of actual prevention of ships accessing Taiwan ports. For this question to resolve YES, we would need: (1) China to actually implement naval interdiction operations preventing commercial or other vessels from reaching Taiwan ports, and (2) the US to publicly characterize this as a blockade. This represents a massive escalation from current activities - essentially an act of war - which neither side has shown signs of pursuing. The distinction between simulation and implementation is critical and deserves more weight in my forecast.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should update my forecast slightly downward. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the actual vs. simulated blockade distinction is well-founded. The question's resolution criteria are specific: not about rhetoric regarding exercises, but about US accusations that China IS blockading ports - present tense, active interdiction. The current situation shows China rehearsing blockades through exercises, which the US acknowledges but doesn't characterize as actual blockades. For escalation to actual blockade implementation within 8 weeks would require: a major triggering event, breakdown of diplomatic channels, or deliberate Chinese decision to escalate dramatically. None of these seem imminent based on available evidence. However, I shouldn't go as low as 7% because there remain scenarios where ambiguous 'gray zone' activities (aggressive inspections, turning back specific vessels, 'quarantine' operations) could be characterized by the US as blockading, and because 8 weeks provides non-trivial time for crisis development. Tail risks of miscalculation during intensive military operations also warrant some probability. My updated forecast balances the strong status quo bias and high bar for actual blockade implementation against the elevated tensions and ongoing military activities in the Taiwan Strait.",
