    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 4 weeks. Election day is expected on or around 25 May 2025; preliminary seat counts usually emerge within 1–3 days after polls close.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the Progressive Reform Party (VHP) remains the largest party by seats, as it was in 2020.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A concentrated anti-incumbent swing—driven by economic discontent (inflation, living costs) and protest votes—boosts the National Democratic Party (NDP) and/or a coordinated opposition slate. If ABOP, NDP, and other smaller parties optimize district-level strategies, the VHP could be overtaken in key multi-member districts, yielding an NDP plurality.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The opposition remains fragmented across NDP, ABOP, and smaller parties, while VHP maintains its 2020 strongholds and enough urban/coastal seats to keep a narrow lead. The NDP’s leadership/legal overhang and lack of broadening appeal limit its gains, and VHP benefits from incumbency organization and perceptions of macroeconomic stabilization and future oil-related optimism.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: In 2020 the VHP won a plurality and formed the government. Suriname’s system (51 seats across multi-member districts with notable malapportionment) rewards efficient geographic concentration and cohesive party machines. Public polling is sparse, so base rates and structural factors matter more than normal.\n\nWhy lean Yes: (1) Incumbent plurality advantage. Starting as the largest party gives VHP a head start; maintaining second-place finishes in many districts can still convert into a plurality in a fragmented field. (2) Opposition fragmentation. NDP, ABOP, and others draw from different constituencies and may split anti-incumbent votes, especially without a pre-election alliance. (3) NDP leadership drag. Legal/credibility issues surrounding Dési Bouterse (and succession uncertainty) likely cap NDP’s cross-over appeal. (4) Narrative of stabilization/optimism. Despite hardship, the government’s IMF-backed stabilization and offshore oil prospects may persuade enough voters to stick with the largest incumbent party rather than risk a return to NDP dominance.\n\nWhy not higher: (1) Economic pain remains salient; incumbents in the region tend to be punished under high inflation/IMF programs. (2) Districting can disadvantage urban-heavy support if swings don’t translate efficiently into seats. (3) If ABOP or others target seats tactically or form local alliances with NDP, VHP could be outpaced in several districts. (4) Protest dynamics: mid-campaign shocks or scandals could disproportionately hit the governing party.\n\nWhy not lower: (1) VHP’s 2020 plurality and organizational presence provide a real structural edge. (2) The opposition lacks unified leadership and clear coordination; even modest fragmentation can be enough for VHP to remain first. (3) The NDP’s brand is still burdened by its recent past, limiting a full-scale resurgence without a compelling renewal narrative.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible district-level polling showing VHP competitive or leading in key multi-member districts; evidence of opposition disunity or failed candidate registrations; positive economic surprises (inflation decline, wage/transfer boosts) without backlash. What would move me down: A durable opposition pact or clear seat-sharing between NDP/ABOP in pivotal districts; signs of a sharp anti-incumbent swing in urban/coastal areas; major government scandals or policy shocks that reignite protests.\n\nResearch assistant summary: No additional information provided; forecast relies on base rates, 2020 results context, party system structure, and qualitative read of incentives and constraints.\n",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
