    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ethiopia maintains its current travel advisory level without escalation to Level 4",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ethiopia continues with its current advisory status (likely Level 2 or 3), with localized security concerns in border regions or specific areas, but without nationwide extreme danger that would warrant the highest travel warning level. Tourism continues in major cities like Addis Ababa, and the security situation remains stable enough for the US government to maintain diplomatic presence.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major security crisis erupts in Ethiopia within the next two months - such as renewed large-scale armed conflict, widespread civil unrest affecting multiple regions, a significant terrorist attack campaign, or political instability threatening US citizens nationwide. This would prompt the State Department to issue a Level 4 advisory recommending all US citizens leave the country immediately and ordering departure of non-emergency US government personnel.",
    "rationale": "Level 4 travel advisories are the most severe designation and relatively rare, reserved for countries experiencing active warfare, complete governmental collapse, or extreme danger to US citizens. Currently, such advisories are typically issued for countries like Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, and certain conflict zones. The background article mentions 'new travel warnings in 2025' which indicates some elevated concern, but the fact that the article contemplates tourism and exploring Addis Ababa's culture suggests the country is not in a Level 4 state currently. Ethiopia has experienced conflicts in recent years (notably the Tigray conflict that ended in 2022), and likely maintains a Level 2 or Level 3 advisory with regional concerns. For escalation to Level 4 in just 2 months, there would need to be a dramatic and sudden deterioration in security conditions affecting the entire country. Such rapid escalations are uncommon. The status quo strongly favors no change - travel advisories, especially to the highest level, require extraordinary circumstances and don't change frequently. My forecast is not higher because there's no indication of imminent major conflict or crisis that would trigger such an extreme advisory change. It's not lower because the mention of new travel warnings suggests some ongoing security concerns that could potentially escalate, and regional conflicts in the Horn of Africa can sometimes intensify rapidly. To update higher, I would need evidence of: major armed conflict breaking out, mass civilian casualties, US embassy evacuation orders, or complete breakdown of governmental authority. To update lower, I would need confirmation that Ethiopia currently has a Level 1 or stable Level 2 status with improving conditions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ethiopia receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Is Ethiopia Safe for Travel?

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Ethiopia has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Ethiopia.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025,\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
