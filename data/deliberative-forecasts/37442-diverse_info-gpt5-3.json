    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a potentially important new signal: early-May reports claiming Berkshire lifted its DPZ stake to ~7%. If those reports are accurate and refer to Q1 activity, that would almost certainly imply a share count above the 2,382,000 threshold and push this to Yes. However, I’m cautious: (1) percentage-stake headlines can move due to issuer buybacks and rounding without any increase in Berkshire’s share count; (2) the timing could be Q2 (April) buying, which wouldn’t appear in the 3/31 13F; and (3) we don’t have a direct, pre-release confirmation of the 13F. Forecaster 3’s argument that Berkshire was a net seller and defensive in Q1 is directionally plausible but contains dubious specifics (e.g., $348B cash) and doesn’t rule out Todd/Ted adding to a mid-cap consumer name. Also, pointing to purchases in Japanese trading houses doesn’t bear on a U.S. 13F line item. Net, Forecaster 2’s point is a real update but not as conclusive as a 90% forecast suggests; Forecaster 3’s low number likely overweights macro posture and questionable data.",
    "rationale": "Prior: 35%, based on base rates (many Berkshire lines don’t change quarter-to-quarter), possibility of confidential treatment, and mixed but not compelling Q1 fundamentals/price action in DPZ. Update: I give some weight to the reported 7% stake claims—if they’re based on fresh info, they raise the likelihood Berkshire added in Q1. But there are two key caveats: (a) DPZ’s buyback (~115k shares) can nudge percentage ownership without Berkshire buying more; and (b) even if Berkshire did add, purchases might have occurred in April (Q2), which wouldn’t affect the Q1 13F. Given those uncertainties and the strict resolution requirement (>2,382,000 shares reported on the Q1 13F), I modestly increase my probability rather than making a large move. I’m not persuaded by the strong No case that macro defensiveness precludes a small add here; Todd/Ted can build positions even while the broader portfolio is trimmed. I am, however, mindful that no change is still the single most likely 13F outcome and that confidential treatment would also resolve No. Net effect: raise from 35% to 45%.",
