    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty secures a small bridge financing/ATM raise, receives forbearance from creditors, cuts burn further, or closes an asset sale that extends runway into/through Q3, allowing them to defer any court filing past July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Liquidity runs out or a secured creditor accelerates; the company cannot meet near-term obligations (e.g., payroll, rent, vendor payments, loan covenants), and the board authorizes a Chapter 11 (or Chapter 7) petition before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and timing: With only ~8 weeks left, the base rate for a US microcap filing bankruptcy in such a short window is relatively low. Even distressed issuers often find ways to eke out additional weeks via cost cuts, small equity raises, or informal forbearance. This tilts the status quo toward “No.”\n- Company-specific priors: AquaBounty has long exhibited high cash burn relative to minimal revenues and has faced delays/pauses on large capex (e.g., its RAS farm build), implying elevated financial stress versus a typical microcap. That raises the near-term risk relative to a generic base rate.\n- Event cadence: If a bankruptcy were imminent due to an immediate cash wall, it often becomes visible via 8-Ks (defaults, forbearance agreements), abrupt operational shutdowns, or announcements of “strategic alternatives” accompanied by retention of restructuring advisors and DIP discussions. With no such confirmed signals in the prompt and given that as of today the criteria have not yet been satisfied, I infer they likely have at least a short runway remaining.\n- The linked 2024 results press release (3/27/2025) could materially affect the estimate if it disclosed runway only into May/June or new defaults. I have not been provided details; absent them, I lean on priors and the short time window.\n- Why not higher: Companies in AquaBounty’s position often avoid a filing for weeks or months through small financings or vendor/creditor accommodations, especially when there’s residual optionality around asset sales. The short window to July 1 further suppresses odds.\n- Why not lower: Persistent high burn, limited revenue, and a history of financing challenges mean a cash crunch within the next two months is plausible, especially if a lender or key vendor forces the issue or an expected financing/asset sale falls through.\n- What would move me up: Any 8-K about covenant/default/acceleration, missed payments, retention of restructuring advisors/DIP discussions, sudden operational shutdowns, or guidance that cash runway ends in May/June.\n- What would move me down: Announced financing (ATM/PIPE/convertible), closed asset sale(s) with meaningful proceeds, extended forbearance/waivers, or clear guidance that runway extends beyond Q3 2025.\n- Research assistant input: None provided beyond the note that the criteria have not yet been satisfied; thus the estimate relies on timing/base rates and general knowledge of distressed microcaps.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill AquaBounty Technologies file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[AquaBounty Technologies Announces Full Year 2024 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603978/000160397825000012/aqb-20250327xex99_1.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
