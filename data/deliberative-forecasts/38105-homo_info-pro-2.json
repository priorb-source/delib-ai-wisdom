    "review": "The other forecasters have provided valuable perspectives that challenge my initial assessment. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the ongoing high-level IMF mission in Beirut and a scheduled follow-up meeting is a crucial piece of evidence indicating serious, active negotiations. I may have initially underweighted this 'leading indicator'. Forecaster 3's analysis aligns more closely with my own focus on Lebanon's entrenched political paralysis but introduces a key detail I had not fully considered: the explicit linkage of a 500 million euro EU aid package to securing an IMF deal. This provides a more tangible and immediate incentive for the political class than generic external pressure. While I find Forecaster 2's 60% forecast overly optimistic given the formidable history of inaction and the extremely short timeline, both forecasters rightly point to new dynamics that increase the pressure for a deal beyond the baseline status quo I had assumed. Their arguments have convinced me that my initial forecast was too low.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 5% to 15%. This significant upward revision is driven by two key arguments raised during deliberation that I had previously underweighted. First, as highlighted by Forecaster 2, the presence of a high-level IMF mission in Beirut for active talks represents a meaningful increase in engagement compared to the prior stalemate. The scheduling of a second round of talks for June 10 further suggests a structured process is underway. Second, as noted by Forecaster 3, the specific linkage of a 500 million euro EU aid package to an IMF agreement provides a concrete, short-term incentive for Lebanon's political actors that did not exist before. These factors combined increase the probability of a breakthrough. However, I am not raising my forecast further because the primary obstacle remains unchanged: the deep-seated political resistance to implementing foundational reforms (like the bank-restructuring law) that threaten the vested interests of the ruling elite. Overcoming years of gridlock to pass such contentious legislation in just one month remains a very high bar, making a 'No' outcome the most likely scenario. My updated forecast of 15% now better reflects the tension between the increased short-term pressure for a deal and the profound, long-term structural impediments to achieving one.",
