    "no_outcome_scenario": "Protests continue but are treated by the Tracker as part of earlier movements (e.g., ongoing Gaza-related or issue-specific actions), or no distinct, nationwide event exceeding 10,000 participants starts before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A clearly new wave begins and is large enough to warrant its own entry—e.g., a major Supreme Court ruling, high-salience incident, or coordinated national day of action triggers 10,000+ demonstrators in a U.S. city, and Carnegie creates a new U.S. protest entry with a start date in May–June 2025 and a stated size ≥10,000.",
    "rationale": "Framing: The question requires a new Global Protest Tracker (Carnegie) entry for the U.S. with a start date after launch and before July 1, 2025, and with 10,000+ participants. The Tracker is selective and typically adds only major, distinct protest waves, often one entry per broad movement. That makes “new entry within ~2 months” a relatively high bar even if large protests happen.\n\nBase rate and selectivity: Since 2017, the U.S. has had a handful of Tracker entries (e.g., Women’s March, March for Our Lives, George Floyd protests, post-Dobbs abortion protests, Gaza-related protests). That’s roughly well under one new U.S. entry per year on average. Mapping this to a two‑month window implies a baseline probability near 10–15% absent special catalysts. Moreover, if current actions are viewed as continuations of preexisting movements (e.g., Gaza-related demonstrations), they are unlikely to receive a new start date.\n\nCatalysts in the window: Possible triggers include a major shock (police violence, high-salience political event) or coordinated national mobilizations. June sometimes brings large demonstrations (e.g., reactions to Supreme Court decisions), but whether 2025 will deliver a decision that catalyzes 10k+ protests is uncertain. Routine large gatherings (e.g., parades) may not be coded by the Tracker as protests. Labor or campus mobilizations could flare, but would need to be both large (≥10k) and distinct enough for a new entry.\n\nStatus quo weighting: Given the Tracker’s conservatism and the need for a fresh entry with a new start date, the status quo (No) is favored over a short horizon. I overweight this because the Tracker changes slowly, and many U.S. protests are incorporated into existing entries rather than new ones.\n\nWhy not higher: Only ~60 days remain; the Tracker is selective; ongoing movements may not get new entries; there is no guaranteed catalyst on the calendar.\n\nWhy not lower: Large U.S. protests do occur with some frequency, and a significant, unforeseen incident or coordinated day of action could produce 10k+ turnout and a new entry. The start date criterion allows an event late in June to qualify even if the Tracker records it afterward.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of a planned nationwide mobilization (with expected crowds ≥10k), a major catalyst (e.g., controversial ruling or incident), or evidence the Tracker has recently been adding new U.S. entries for distinct 2025 waves.\n\nWhat would move me down: Clear de-escalation of major protest activity, lack of any significant triggers through mid-June, or indications that Carnegie is not updating U.S. entries for new waves.\n\nResearch assistant input: No additional information was available; thus, no adjustments from new intel.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in the United States with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBrookings Institution: [The power of protest in the US](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-power-of-protest-in-the-us/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in the United States with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
