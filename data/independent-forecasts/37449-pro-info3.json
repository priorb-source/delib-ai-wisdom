  "information": "According to US military leaders, the upcoming 2025 National Defense Strategy (NDS) will prioritize \"preventing a Chinese attack on Taiwan\" as the sole major assumption scenario. This represents a strategic shift to focus on the Indo-Pacific region. At the same time, US Admiral Samuel Paparo has warned that China is rapidly increasing its production of warships and submarines relative to the US, stating a production ratio of 6 to 1.8 for warships and 2 to 1.4 for submarines. Paparo stated that while the US would prevail in a conflict now, its military forces are on a \"bad trajectory.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The People's Republic of China (PRC) is not blockading Taiwan, and therefore the US has made no such accusation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China continues its 'gray zone' tactics, such as military exercises and incursions into Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone, but does not attempt to halt or control civilian maritime traffic to Taiwanese seaports. The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without the US having grounds to make a public accusation of a blockade.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to a perceived provocation, such as a speech or action by Taiwan's new administration, the PRC declares a 'quarantine' or 'military exercise zone' around a major Taiwanese port like Kaohsiung. The PLA Navy proceeds to interdict commercial vessels, prompting a formal public statement from the White House or State Department accusing the PRC of implementing a blockade.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo. A blockade is a clear act of war that would likely trigger devastating economic sanctions against China and risk direct military conflict with the United States and its allies. The immense costs and risks associated with this action for the PRC make it a highly improbable event, especially within the short timeframe of less than two months. The information from my research assistant about the US National Defense Strategy and China's naval buildup confirms that this is a major long-term concern, but it does not indicate immediate intent from Beijing to escalate to this level. While potential flashpoints like the upcoming Taiwanese presidential inauguration exist, China's past responses to provocations have been limited to large-scale military drills, not actions that halt global commerce. My probability is not higher because a blockade would be a catastrophic strategic gamble for the PRC with a high probability of backfiring. It is not lower than 4% because the possibility of a severe miscalculation or an extreme reaction to a perceived provocation from Taiwan, however small, cannot be entirely dismissed. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see intelligence indicating a significant and unusual mobilization of PLA naval forces prepared for a sustained maritime operation, coupled with rhetoric from Beijing explicitly threatening a 'quarantine' of the island. Conversely, a quiet post-inauguration period would cause me to lower this forecast.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of blockading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWSJ via MSN: [China Is Ready to Blockade Taiwan. Here’s How.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/china-is-ready-to-blockade-taiwan-here-s-how/ar-AA1BvnW8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of blockading at least one of Taiwan's seaports without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to US military leaders, the upcoming 2025 National Defense Strategy (NDS) will prioritize \"preventing a Chinese attack on Taiwan\" as the sole major assumption scenario.

At the same time, US Admiral Samuel Paparo has warned that China is rapidly increasing its production of warships and submarines relative to the US, stating a production ratio of 6 to 1.8 for warships and 2 to 1.4 for submarines.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
