    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement that a 'No' outcome is overwhelmingly likely, with our forecasts all falling in the low single digits (5-8%). The core evidence we all cite is the lack of an official invitation to India as of June 3, with the G7 summit less than two weeks away, which is a major deviation from normal diplomatic and logistical protocols. The other forecasters raised a few points that refined my thinking. Forecaster 3 made two particularly useful points: first, that India has a history of being willing to accept late invitations to high-profile events, which somewhat mitigates the logistical barrier; and second, that there is a precedent for Canada not inviting India to a G7 outreach (in 2018), which strengthens the baseline 'No' case. Both forecasters seem to place slightly more weight than I did on the small possibility of a last-minute political decision by the new Canadian government to issue a late invitation as a diplomatic gesture, viewing the logistical hurdles as difficult but not insurmountable.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 5% was heavily anchored on the lack of an invitation so close to the summit, which I viewed as making a visit logistically next to impossible. After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain my core thesis that attendance is highly unlikely. However, the other forecasters have convinced me to slightly increase my probability. The key argument that swayed me, primarily from Forecaster 3, is that the primary barrier is political, not logistical. If a last-minute political decision were made to invite PM Modi, India would likely be willing and able to scramble to make the visit happen, perhaps for a compressed schedule. The logistical challenge, while severe, is not an absolute blocker if political will exists on both sides. This shifts the question from 'is it possible?' to 'will Canada extend a very late invitation?'. While I still believe this is extremely improbable due to the strained bilateral relations and domestic political pressure in Canada, the arguments from my colleagues suggest I may have slightly underestimated the small chance of a last-minute diplomatic maneuver by the new Canadian government. Therefore, I am making a small upward adjustment to my forecast from 5% to 7% to better account for this remote possibility.",
