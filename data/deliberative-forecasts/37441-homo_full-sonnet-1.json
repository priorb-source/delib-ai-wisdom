    "review": "Both forecasters independently arrived at 18%, which is 50% higher than my initial 12%. They make compelling points about not dismissing the downward momentum and policy risks too quickly, noting that while rare, such moves are 'non-negligible' rather than extremely unlikely. However, I notice all three of us are working from the same fundamental analysis - we agree on the magnitude of the required move (9.5% in ~50 days), the existing bearish momentum (7% YTD), the structural concerns (Q1 contraction, trade uncertainty), and the countervailing factors (BoA's opposite forecast, May's historical weakness for EUR/USD, resilient labor market). The key difference appears to be how much weight we assign to the current momentum versus the extreme nature of the required acceleration. Their 18% forecast seems to place more emphasis on the possibility of rapid policy shifts or trade escalations creating sudden moves, while my 12% weighted the status quo more heavily. I find their argument that I may be over-weighting status quo bias partially convincing - currency markets can move quickly when sentiment shifts, and trade policy remains genuinely unpredictable. However, I also think 18% may slightly underweight how extreme a 9.5% move in 50 days truly is for a major currency pair without crisis conditions.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I believe there's merit to increasing my forecast somewhat, but not all the way to 18%. The key insight from the deliberation is that the existing downward momentum (7% YTD) and genuine policy uncertainties (potential Fed cuts, trade tensions) deserve more weight than I initially assigned. However, I remain convinced that the magnitude and timeframe of the required move is sufficiently extreme to warrant a probability below 20%. The historical pattern of May weakness for EUR/USD, Bank of America's contrary forecast, and the fact that even bullish technical analysts target late 2025 (not July 1st) for the 1.25 level all suggest significant headwinds. The 33-37% probability of Fed cuts by July also indicates market skepticism about aggressive policy shifts. I'm updating to 15% to acknowledge the real momentum and risks while maintaining that this outcome requires an acceleration of current trends that would be historically unusual without a major catalyst. This forecast reflects: (1) genuine downward USD momentum exists, (2) policy risks are unpredictable and could trigger rapid moves, but (3) the required 10%+ move in EUR/USD within 50 days remains at the tail of probable outcomes for major currency pairs.",
