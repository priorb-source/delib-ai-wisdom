    "review": "Both forecasters rightly emphasize the short window and the linguistic/style barrier. However, I find their 18–20% probabilities too high given the resolution’s exact-phrase requirement. The key point is that the NYT overwhelmingly uses “reverse repurchase (agreement)” and “reverse auction,” not “reverse purchase/purchasing.” The Russian and China angles are newsworthy, but neither compels NYT to adopt this exact phrasing. Forecaster 2’s Alipay/tariff hook is interesting but still doesn’t solve the terminology hurdle. Forecaster 3’s Russia scenario is plausible as coverage, but NYT would almost certainly opt for “buyback,” “repurchase,” or “forced sale,” not “reverse purchase.”",
    "rationale": "- Base rate: “reverse purchasing” and “reverse purchase” are vanishingly rare in mainstream U.S. journalism, especially at NYT, which favors established style (“repurchase,” “buyback,” “reverse repo”). The exact-search constraint dramatically lowers odds.\n- Window: Only June 10–30. Even if the underlying stories are covered, the probability of using that precise phrasing within this tiny window remains low.\n- Near-miss terms won’t count: Recent items (“reverse repurchase agreements,” “reverse auction,” “reverse book-building”) are close but do not satisfy the exact phrase.\n- Pathways to Yes exist but are thin: (1) A China-trend explainer or feature explicitly translating and quoting “reverse purchasing”; (2) A guest essay or newsletter reproducing the term; (3) Syndicated content using that wording that NYT carries. I’d move up if Bloomberg/WSJ/FT begin using the exact term or if a prominent wire piece with that phrasing gains traction.\nGiven the above, I keep a low probability but acknowledge a small tail from a translation/quote scenario, nudging slightly upward from my prior 3% to 4%.",
