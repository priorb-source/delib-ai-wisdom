  "information": "As of April 30, 2025, the official UN OCHA impact snapshot reported 295 UN staff fatalities in Gaza. Reports from late April cited UNRWA stating that 295 of its personnel had died since October 7, 2023. This number reflects a steady increase over time; a UN report on March 19, 2025, had stated at least 280 UN employees were killed, and an OCHA report cited on January 9, 2025, listed 263 UNRWA staff fatalities. Broader figures for humanitarian workers indicate a higher total toll; an OCHA report on April 23, 2025, stated that at least 418 humanitarian workers, including the 295 UN staff, had been killed in Gaza since the conflict began. A specific incident on March 23, 2025, resulted in the deaths of 15 humanitarian personnel, including staff from the Palestinian Red Crescent and one UN staff member.\n\nThe United Nations has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, exacerbated by a blockade that severely restricts access to aid, food, water, and medical supplies. In early May 2025, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher called the aid blockade a form of 'cruel collective punishment,' noting that over 3,000 aid trucks were stalled at the border. According to OCHA reports from late April and early May 2025, insecurity and access restrictions have compelled humanitarian organizations to close nutrition centers. The same reports indicated an 80% rise in children being treated for malnutrition and that 65% of residents lack access to clean drinking water. The UN Population Fund also announced it had exhausted its supply of emergency shelter materials and hygiene products.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Israel's security cabinet reportedly approved a plan to intensify military operations in the Gaza Strip. This follows a period of renewed violence since a ceasefire broke down in mid-March 2025. The UN has described Gaza as one of the most dangerous places in the world for humanitarian workers, with its personnel and facilities at risk from military activity. The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has stated that humanitarian efforts are severely hindered by severe restrictions on movement within the territory. The International Red Cross also noted that the deteriorating security situation is hindering the work of its staff and partners.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current trend of UN staff fatalities, averaging around 8 per month recently, would push the total well over 300 before July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A swift and durable ceasefire is implemented in May 2025, drastically reducing hostilities and preventing further UN staff deaths for the remainder of the period. Alternatively, UN operations are significantly scaled back or security measures become so effective that no more than four additional staff members are killed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The conflict continues at its current intensity or escalates as recently announced by the Israeli security cabinet. Airstrikes and ground operations continue, leading to at least five additional UN staff fatalities over the next eight weeks through either a single incident or a continued rate of individual casualties.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on three main factors: the small gap to the threshold, the established trend of fatalities, and the high likelihood of continued or intensified conflict. As of April 30, 2025, the count stands at 295, meaning only five more fatalities are needed to cross the 300 threshold. The resolution date is nearly two months away, providing ample time for this to occur. The data shows a steady increase in fatalities, rising from 263 in early January to 295 by the end of April, an average of approximately 8 deaths per month. Projecting this rate forward suggests another 16 fatalities by July 1, far exceeding the number needed for a 'Yes' outcome. Critically, on May 5, 2025, Israel's security cabinet reportedly approved a plan to intensify military operations. This planned escalation significantly increases the risk to all individuals in Gaza, including UN humanitarian workers, making the 'status quo' scenario of continued casualties the most probable one. My probability is not higher because a sudden, unexpected, and lasting ceasefire remains a possibility, however remote. Such an event could halt the increase in fatalities. My probability is not lower because the combination of a small remaining number needed, a consistent past rate of casualties, and a stated intention to escalate the conflict creates a very strong body of evidence pointing towards the threshold being met. For me to lower my forecast, there would need to be credible reports of an imminent and durable ceasefire agreement being implemented.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
