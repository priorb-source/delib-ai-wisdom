  "information": "According to media reports citing the Kremlin, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held phone conversations on February 12, 2025, and March 18, 2025. The February call reportedly lasted nearly 90 minutes. The March call was to discuss the war in Ukraine and a potential 30-day ceasefire proposal. On April 4, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that no phone conversations between the leaders were planned for the near future.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that a meeting between Putin and Trump is 'certainly necessary' and 'on everyone's lips.' However, Peskov emphasized that any such meeting requires 'adequate preparation' at 'various expert levels' and that, as of that date, there were no specific details or a set date.\n\nDonald Trump is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates in mid-May 2025 to participate in a Gulf summit. In late April, Trump mentioned the possibility of a meeting with Putin during this trip. On May 5, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Putin's schedule does not currently include a trip to the Middle East.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks. The question resolves on June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recent Kremlin statements indicate that while a meeting is desired, it requires significant preparation and no high-level contact is currently scheduled.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The diplomatic preparations for a future summit are conducted by aides and foreign policy advisors, as is standard. Trump and Putin decide to wait to speak directly until they can meet in person, an event which takes longer than one month to arrange and is scheduled for after the resolution date. No major crisis emerges which necessitates an urgent call.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant development in the war in Ukraine, or another international crisis, prompts an urgent need for direct communication between the two leaders to de-escalate tensions. Alternatively, as a preliminary step in planning their future in-person summit, they hold a call to agree on a broad agenda. Both sides publicly acknowledge the call occurred.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an analysis of recent precedent, current diplomatic signaling, and the typical pacing of high-level international relations. While Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin have spoken twice by phone in early 2025, demonstrating established channels and a willingness to communicate, the most recent official statements suggest a lower likelihood of a call within the specified one-month window. On May 5, the Kremlin, while calling a meeting 'certainly necessary', emphasized it requires 'adequate preparation' at 'various expert levels,' with no specifics or dates set. This language points towards a formal, slow-moving diplomatic process for a future in-person summit, rather than an imminent phone call. The status quo, based on the Kremlin's April 4 statement that no calls were planned, appears to remain in effect. The world changes slowly, and the current diplomatic posture is not one of immediate high-level engagement. The probability is not lower than 30% because the geopolitical situation, particularly in Ukraine, is volatile. A sudden crisis could easily necessitate a call. Furthermore, Trump's preference for personal diplomacy could lead him to initiate a call to accelerate summit planning. The probability is not higher than 30% because the official guidance from the Kremlin points to a deliberate, methodical process handled by subordinates before any leaders' meeting, making a call within the next five weeks unlikely to be the first step. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see official statements confirming a call is being planned or a significant escalation in a global crisis involving both nations. For me to decrease my forecast, I would need to see explicit statements from both sides ruling out any communication before a potential summit later in the year.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both Trump and Putin, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to media reports citing the Kremlin, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held phone conversations on February 12, 2025, and March 18, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
