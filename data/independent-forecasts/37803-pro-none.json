    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks, as the resolution date is July 1, 2025.",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current administration's policy of removing climate-related information from government websites continues to be enforced. The Department of Defense complies with this directive, and climate.mil remains offline past the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Internal stakeholders within the Department of Defense successfully argue that the portal is a critical tool for national security and operational readiness, distinct from the administration's broader climate policy. The site is quietly brought back online to support military planning.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is primarily driven by the strong evidence of a top-down political directive from the Trump administration to remove climate change information from federal websites, as reported by The Guardian. The status quo heavily favors a 'No' outcome since the website is already down, and restoring it requires a specific action that runs contrary to the administration's stated policy. My research assistant's report indicated no additional information was available to influence this view. \n\nMy probability is not lower because the Department of Defense has historically treated climate change as a non-partisan national security issue and a 'threat multiplier.' There is a non-trivial chance that the military's institutional imperative to maintain operational readiness could lead to internal advocacy and the quiet restoration of what it considers a critical planning tool.\n\nMy probability is not higher because reversing a decision that aligns with a key administration policy within a short six-week timeframe is unlikely. Public-facing websites are highly visible and easy targets for policy enforcement. Overcoming the political and bureaucratic inertia to bring the site back online represents a significant hurdle.\n\nI would update my forecast higher if there were credible reports of pushback from senior DoD officials or if other national security-related climate websites were restored. I would update lower if the White House issued more specific directives to purge such content or if DoD climate resilience programs were publicly defunded.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US military's climate resiliance portal be back online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Guardian [Scientists brace ‘for the worst’ as Trump purges climate mentions from websites](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/04/trump-climate-change-federal-websites)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if climate.mil is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/climate.mil.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 5, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Climate.mil is DOWN for everyone.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
