    "review": "All three forecasters identified identical factors and reached remarkably similar conclusions (15-18%). We all noted: (1) airline capacity increases of 7-10%, (2) consistent Q1 2025 growth of 2.2-3.6%, (3) Easter timing advantage, and (4) limited power outage impact. Forecaster 3's precise calculation that the April 28 outage affected only ~0.2% of monthly flights (344 of ~180,000 monthly flights) actually reinforces that the disruption was even more limited than I initially estimated. No forecaster introduced new evidence or arguments I hadn't considered. The convergence of our independent analyses validates the strength of the evidence for continued growth.",
    "rationale": "The deliberation confirms my original reasoning. The structural factors favoring growth are overwhelming: airline capacity intentionally increased for spring 2025, Q1 established a clear upward trend, and Easter's calendar placement mechanically favors April 2025 comparisons. The power outage on April 28 affected only the final 2-3 days of the month, with precise data showing approximately 5.7% of one day's flights cancelled. Even assuming cascading effects, this represents perhaps 0.5-1% of monthly traffic - insufficient to overcome month-long growth advantages. For April 2025 to decline, we would need the Easter effect to be negligible (unlikely given it's a major travel period), the power outage to have caused multi-day systemic collapse (not evidenced), and the Q1 growth trend to have mysteriously reversed (no indication of this). The convergence of three independent forecasters on similar probability ranges (15-18%) suggests robust analysis rather than groupthink, as we're all working from public data. I'm maintaining 15% to account for measurement uncertainty and potential unreported factors, but the weight of evidence strongly favors continued growth.",
