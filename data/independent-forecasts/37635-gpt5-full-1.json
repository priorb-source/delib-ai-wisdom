  "information": "According to reports from May 2025, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has achieved a 76% approval rating, making her the best-evaluated president since the 1994-2000 term. In specific areas, 63.4% of respondents positively evaluated her management of poverty reduction, and her administration's policies have been linked to a 24.9% reduction in homicides. However, on transparency and anti-corruption, 57.4% of respondents had a negative perception. Her administration has announced a $298 billion investment plan. Some polls cited her approval rating as high as 82%.\n\nA survey in Argentina conducted between April 28 and 30, 2025, by D'Alessio IROL/Berensztein indicated growing wear on Javier Milei's government. The survey showed his positive image has decreased to 44%, while his negative image has increased to 52%, for a net differential of -8%. 52% of respondents believe the economic situation is worse than the previous year. The evaluation of his government is divided, with 50% rating it as good and 48% as bad. Security Minister Patricia Bullrich has the highest positive image in the cabinet at 47%, as insecurity is the main social concern for 72% of respondents.\n\nAn international survey by Morning Consult conducted between January 21 and 27, 2025, placed Claudia Sheinbaum's approval rating at 66% and Javier Milei's at 65%. A later report from April 30, 2025, citing Morning Consult data, showed Milei's approval at 61% and Sheinbaum's at 60%. In the January survey, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had the highest approval rating at 75%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (≈45 days) until June 28, 2025; Metaculus will use the Morning Consult reading checked on or after that date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. As of the latest cited Morning Consult snapshot (Apr 30, 2025), Milei 61% vs Sheinbaum 60%, so if nothing changed the question would resolve Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By late June, Morning Consult shows Sheinbaum tied with or ahead of Milei (e.g., Sheinbaum 62%, Milei 59%, or a 60–60 tie).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milei holds a narrow edge in the late-June Morning Consult update (e.g., Milei 62%, Sheinbaum 60%) and avoids a tie.",
    "rationale": "Both leaders are clustered around 60% in Morning Consult, with small week-to-week movements. The status quo narrowly favors Milei (61 vs 60), but that one-point edge is fragile and a tie counts as No. Morning Consult’s January wave had Sheinbaum 66 and Milei 65, and the April 30 report flipped to Milei 61, Sheinbaum 60, indicating they trade places and sit within typical sampling/rounding noise. That raises the chance of a tie or a small lead change by late June. Outside-poll context tilts slightly toward Sheinbaum improving relative to Milei: domestic Mexican polling in May shows very high approvals for Sheinbaum (some as high as the mid-70s), suggesting a continued honeymoon that Morning Consult could partially reflect. In Argentina, recent domestic polling shows wear on Milei (e.g., positive image around the mid-40s and net negative balances), though Morning Consult has tended to rate him higher than many local polls. Over the next 6 weeks, modest shifts of 1–3 points are plausible for each leader. Given how close they are and the tie-resolves-No rule, the base one-point Milei advantage is not enough to make Yes more likely than No. Why not higher: tie risk is meaningful, Sheinbaum’s honeymoon remains strong in other surveys, and Milei faces domestic headwinds despite disinflation. Why not lower: Morning Consult has recently shown Milei slightly ahead; continued disinflation, any legislative wins, or positive market headlines could buoy him, and Sheinbaum could face bumps from policy or market concerns. What would move me up: two consecutive June Morning Consult updates with Milei leading by 2–3+ points; clear positive Argentine macro/policy headlines; or any Sheinbaum stumble that knocks her MC approval down a few points. What would move me down: Morning Consult shows Sheinbaum back to mid-60s while Milei slips to high-50s; notable Argentine protests/economic setbacks; or continued tight readings implying a high tie probability.",
