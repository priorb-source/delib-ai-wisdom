  "information": "In early March 2025, during the inauguration of President Yamandú Orsi in Montevideo, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva publicly invited Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico to the BRICS summit scheduled for July in Rio de Janeiro. Lula stated, 'it's essential that these countries participate, because it's a moment for debate with the whole world.' Following the invitation, President Orsi expressed interest in participating, stating he hoped other Latin American countries would join to 'consolidate multilateralism and free trade.'\n\nPresident Yamandú Orsi is confirmed to travel to Seville, Spain, to attend the Fourth International Conference on Sustainable Development Financing. This United Nations conference is scheduled to run from June 30 to July 3, 2025. President Orsi has reaffirmed Uruguay's commitment to multilateralism, stating that his government will be in Seville to 'strengthen and commit' to the UN's objectives.\n\nAs of early June 2025, the government of Uruguay had not issued an official public statement confirming or denying President Orsi's attendance at the BRICS summit. Media coverage at the time described the country's participation as 'undecided' or 'up in the air.' The BRICS summit is scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro on July 6-7, 2025. Other leaders, including India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are planning to attend.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days until the resolution deadline of July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - as of June 5, 2025, no official announcement has been made despite 3 months since the invitation",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Uruguay continues to postpone a decision and makes no announcement before July 1. The government may be hesitant due to the scheduling conflict with the Spain UN conference (June 30-July 3) and the BRICS summit (July 6-7), making it logistically difficult for President Orsi to attend both events. Political considerations about aligning with BRICS may also lead to quiet avoidance of a public commitment.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In the coming weeks, Uruguay's government issues an official statement confirming President Orsi will attend the BRICS summit. Despite the tight schedule with the Spain conference, Uruguay decides the BRICS invitation is strategically important enough to commit to, possibly by adjusting travel plans to attend both events or leaving the Spain conference early. A government spokesperson makes the announcement at a press conference or through official communication channels.",
    "rationale": "This forecast weighs several competing factors. On the positive side, President Orsi expressed interest in participating and emphasized multilateralism and regional cooperation, suggesting openness to attending. Uruguay values its relationships with regional powers like Brazil, and participation could enhance its international standing. However, several significant obstacles lower the probability. Most critically, three months have passed since the invitation with no official announcement despite expressed interest - this inaction suggests hesitation or internal disagreement within the government. The scheduling conflict is substantial: attending a UN conference in Spain through July 3, then traveling to Rio for a July 6-7 summit is logistically challenging. With only 26 days remaining until the resolution deadline, time pressure is mounting. Media reports describe the situation as 'undecided' or 'up in the air,' indicating no imminent decision. Status quo bias is important here - when governments haven't acted over an extended period, they often continue not acting. The forecast is not lower because there is genuine expressed interest from Orsi, Uruguay does value multilateral engagement, and 26 days provides adequate time for an announcement if the political will exists. The forecast is not higher because the three-month delay, scheduling conflict, and lack of any recent signals suggesting an imminent announcement all point toward continued indecision or a quiet decline. For the forecast to move higher, I would need to see concrete signals of preparation, resolution of the Spain conference conflict, or statements from government officials suggesting an announcement is forthcoming. For it to move lower, more time would need to pass without action or explicit decline statements would need to emerge.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn early March 2025, during the inauguration of President Yamandú Orsi in Montevideo, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva publicly invited Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico to the BRICS summit scheduled for July in Rio de Janeiro.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
