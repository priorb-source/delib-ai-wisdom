    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that challenge my initial pessimism. Forecaster 3 raises a crucial point I missed: FSIS closure depends on effectiveness checks and corrective actions, not full retrieval from consumers' freezers. This significantly reduces a concern I overweighted. Both emphasize that the 12.5-week window from April 5 to July 1 is actually quite comfortable within the typical 2-4 month closure range, and Forecaster 2 correctly notes this provides 'ample buffer' even for minor delays. They also both weight Johnsonville's specific company history (4-8 weeks) more heavily than I did, which is reasonable given company-specific patterns can be strong predictors. However, I notice both may be slightly underweighting that we're still only 5 weeks into a typical 8-16 week process, and that the median of the 2-4 month range (90 days) would put closure at July 5 - just after the deadline. The Class I designation does require more rigorous FSIS verification, which both acknowledge but perhaps don't fully account for in their probability assignments.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing their analyses, I'm updating significantly upward from my initial 38% forecast. The key insight about FSIS closure requirements not needing complete consumer retrieval substantially reduces my concern about products in freezers. The 12.5-week total window genuinely does provide reasonable time for closure within typical patterns. Johnsonville's 4-8 week track record, combined with the limited scope (single production date, ~22,672 lbs), supports a faster resolution scenario. However, I'm not moving all the way to 65-70% because: (1) We're still early at 5 weeks in, with 7.5 weeks remaining - barely past the midpoint, (2) The median 2-4 month timeline (90 days) would be July 5, just missing our deadline, (3) Class I recalls face genuinely more stringent verification requirements that could extend timelines, (4) Several 2024 plastic contamination recalls remained open for extended periods. My updated forecast of 58% reflects meaningful adjustment based on the clarifications while maintaining appropriate caution about Class I complexity and timeline positioning. This puts me between my original forecast and the other forecasters, acknowledging both their valid points and the real timing risks that remain.",
