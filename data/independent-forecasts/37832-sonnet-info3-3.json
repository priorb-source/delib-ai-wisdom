  "instance": 3,
  "information": "As of late May 2025, there have been no public reports of Databricks selecting underwriters for an IPO or of the company making a confidential S-1 filing with the SEC. Market sentiment has been described as uncertain, with some IPO advisors noting that while planning is occurring, macroeconomic concerns might cause delays. Other major tech startups, such as Stripe, have also remained private despite IPO expectations. In contrast, companies like Klarna and eToro have reportedly filed confidential IPO paperwork.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days (from May 22, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Databricks does not announce an IPO",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks continues following its CEO's stated position that it would be 'dumb to IPO this year.' The company remains private through July 1, 2025, with no S-1 filing or website announcement of IPO plans. Market uncertainty and macroeconomic concerns support the decision to delay going public.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Databricks unexpectedly reverses course due to dramatically improved market conditions, investor pressure, or strategic considerations. The company either files an SEC Form S-1 or announces IPO plans on its website before July 1, 2025, despite the CEO's recent public statements against an IPO in 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a NO outcome. The CEO's explicit statement that 'it's dumb to IPO this year' is a powerful signal, especially given we're already in late May 2025 with only 40 days until resolution. The research assistant confirms no signs of IPO preparation: no underwriter selection, no confidential S-1 filing, and market sentiment remains uncertain. This contrasts with companies like Klarna and eToro that have filed confidential paperwork. For a YES outcome, Databricks would need to dramatically reverse its public stance and execute significant preparation work in just over a month - highly improbable. The forecast is not 0% because: (1) companies can surprise markets with sudden announcements, (2) 40 days provides non-zero time for developments, and (3) we cannot fully rule out non-public strategic discussions. However, the probability remains very low. To update upward, I would need evidence of underwriter selection, confidential filing reports, or changed leadership statements. The forecast would go lower only with additional explicit statements about extended timeline for remaining private or further market deterioration. The CEO's recent, unambiguous statement combined with zero preparation signals and a short timeframe justifies a probability in the 2-5% range.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, there have been no public reports of Databricks selecting underwriters for an IPO or of the company making a confidential S-1 filing with the SEC. Market sentiment has been described as uncertain, with some IPO advisors noting that while planning is occurring, macroeconomic concerns might cause delays. Other major tech startups, such as Stripe, have also remained private despite IPO expectations. In contrast, companies like Klarna and eToro have reportedly filed confidential IPO paperwork.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
