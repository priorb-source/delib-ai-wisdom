  "information": "A primary focus of the summit will be defense spending among NATO members. President Trump has been advocating for member countries to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, a significant increase from the current 2% target. In response to this pressure, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte (or Jens Stoltenberg, sources vary) has reportedly proposed a compromise deal: a target of 3.5% of GDP on direct defense spending by 2032, with an additional 1.5% allocated for broader security-related expenditures. The discussions will also address military aid to Ukraine, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to attend.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2–4 weeks (the NATO Summit is slated for June 2025; confirmation will be clear on summit dates).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — U.S. presidents almost always attend NATO summits, and Trump attended NATO summits in his prior term.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump skips to apply leverage on allies over defense-spending targets or Ukraine policy, or an unforeseen constraint (health, domestic crisis, security issue, or scheduling conflict) leads him to send the Vice President or Secretary of State instead.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump travels to The Hague, appears in plenary/photo-op sessions with allied leaders, and uses the platform to press for higher defense-spending commitments (e.g., beyond 2%), possibly touting a compromise deal or pushing allies toward his preferred targets.",
    "rationale": "Base rates strongly favor attendance: U.S. presidents customarily attend NATO summits, and Trump personally attended during his first term despite contentious rhetoric. The political incentives also point to going: this is a high-visibility venue to pressure allies on defense spending, which aligns with his stated objective to push well above 2% (the research assistant notes he has floated 5%, with reporting of a possible compromise around 3.5% direct defense and 1.5% broader security by 2032). If Zelensky attends and Ukraine aid is discussed, Trump can shape narratives and extract concessions in person. These factors make attendance the status quo path.\n\nReasons against a higher probability: Trump’s unpredictability, potential to use non-attendance as bargaining leverage, and the possibility of late-breaking domestic or security constraints. While rare, last-minute travel cancellations by presidents can occur. Additionally, if the White House calculates that a boycott increases bargaining power on spending targets or Ukraine policy, a deliberate no-show is conceivable.\n\nReasons against a lower probability: The institutional and diplomatic costs of skipping are high; presidents almost invariably go. Trump has historically preferred in-person, made-for-TV confrontations to drive headlines and compel concessions. The short time horizon also reduces the window for disruptive events.\n\nKey updates to watch: (1) Official White House schedule or advance guidance confirming the President’s travel; (2) U.S. delegation list or embassy/host government confirmations; (3) credible reports of Trump conditioning attendance on pre-summit concessions; (4) any emergent domestic crisis, health issue, or security threat; (5) signals from NATO leadership about the spending framework that might change Trump’s calculus.\n\nNetting these considerations, attendance remains the most likely outcome but with a meaningful tail for strategic non-attendance or unforeseen disruption.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the NATO Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Netherlands to host 2025 NATO Summit in The Hague](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_225618.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a NATO summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the NATO Summit such that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA primary focus of the summit will be defense spending among NATO members. President Trump has been advocating for member countries to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, a significant increase from the current 2% target.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
