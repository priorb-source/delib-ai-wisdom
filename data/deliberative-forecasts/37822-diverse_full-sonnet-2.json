    "review": "Forecaster 3 and I converged on 30%, while Forecaster 2 came in much higher at 60%. The deliberation revealed several valuable points I hadn't fully considered: (1) The Q2 FEC fundraising deadline (June 30) provides a concrete near-term catalyst for announcement, as it would allow demonstrating fundraising strength immediately; (2) The Texas filing deadline being in December 2025 means there's no actual urgency to announce by July 1 - this significantly strengthens the No case; (3) The strategic value of waiting to assess GOP primary dynamics and clear the Democratic field. Forecaster 2's 60% probability seems insufficiently anchored to the status quo. While they acknowledge the lack of visible preparation, they appear to over-weight historical timing patterns and interpret O'Rourke's conditional statements as 'classic political maneuvers' signaling imminent launch. I find this interpretation speculative. The complete absence of FEC filings, staff hiring, or exploratory committee formation with only 40 days remaining is a very strong signal. Politicians who announce major campaigns typically have observable preparation weeks or months in advance. Forecaster 3's analysis is more rigorous in weighing the incentive structure - particularly noting that with a December filing deadline, there's actually strategic value in waiting rather than rushing an announcement. The Q2 fundraising deadline is interesting but not decisive enough to override the lack of any observable campaign activity.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I maintain that 30% is the appropriate forecast. The key factors: (1) Status quo strongly favors No - zero visible campaign infrastructure, no FEC activity, no staff hiring despite being in late May with only 40 days left; (2) The December 2025 Texas filing deadline means there is no urgency whatsoever to announce by July 1, undermining the case for an imminent announcement; (3) While the 16-month pre-election window aligns with O'Rourke's historical patterns, this is not deterministic - his circumstances differ now after two losses; (4) The Q2 FEC deadline (June 30) provides modest upward pressure but is not compelling enough given the lack of preparation; (5) His conditional public statements ('if voters want me to') sound more like genuine deliberation than imminent-announcement positioning. A 60% forecast like Forecaster 2's requires believing that a major Senate campaign will materialize from zero visible activity in 40 days, which seems inconsistent with how modern campaigns actually launch. The 30% probability appropriately reflects that while a quick announcement remains possible given O'Rourke's name recognition and existing networks, the base rate strongly favors the status quo of no announcement continuing through July 1.",
