  "information": "A novel bat coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, has been identified and is part of the Merbecovirus family, which includes the MERS virus. Research published in the journal 'Cell' confirms that the virus can bind to human ACE2 receptors and infect human airway and organoid cultures in laboratory settings. However, studies also indicate that its cell-entry efficiency is significantly lower than that of SARS-CoV-2.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The virus's low cell-entry efficiency, as noted in lab studies, proves to be a significant barrier in a real-world setting. Despite potential exposure opportunities, the virus fails to establish a successful infection in a human host. Surveillance systems continue to monitor for novel pathogens, but no cases of HKU5-CoV-2 are detected or reported by credible health organizations before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An individual in a region of China with a high population of the host bats (e.g., a researcher, caver, or someone living in close proximity to a colony) has a high-dose exposure to the virus. This exposure overcomes the low cell-entry efficiency, leading to a successful infection. Due to heightened global awareness and surveillance post-COVID-19, the individual's illness is investigated, the virus is sequenced, and the WHO or a national body like the CDC confirms and reports the first human case of HKU5-CoV-2.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high bar for a zoonotic spillover event of a specific virus to occur and be detected within a very short timeframe. The status quo, which I weigh heavily, is that there are no known human cases. \n\nThe research indicating that HKU5-CoV-2 can bind to human ACE2 receptors and infect human cells in vitro confirms that a key prerequisite for human infection is met. However, the finding that its cell-entry efficiency is 'significantly lower' than SARS-CoV-2 is the most critical piece of evidence. This suggests that while a spillover is theoretically possible, it is practically difficult and would likely require a high viral-load exposure.\n\nWhy the forecast is not higher: The combination of a short, ~1.5 month window and the virus's low infectivity makes a successful, detected spillover event highly improbable. The vast majority of potential zoonotic viruses never make the leap to humans, and when they do, it's a rare event. The odds of this specific, newly identified virus doing so in the next six weeks are very low.\n\nWhy the forecast is not lower: The probability is not near-zero because the biological pathway for infection exists (ACE2 binding), and the virus belongs to the same family as MERS-CoV, which has a known history of causing human disease. Furthermore, global genomic surveillance capabilities are far more advanced and sensitive than they were pre-2020, slightly increasing the chance that a rare, single case would be detected and identified if it did occur.\n\nI would increase my forecast if new research demonstrated a mutation in circulating HKU5-CoV-2 strains that enhances cell-entry efficiency, or if credible reports of unexplained respiratory illness clusters emerged from relevant geographic areas. I would decrease it as the deadline approaches with no such developments.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be any human cases of the novel coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Discovery of HKU5-CoV-2, a Novel Coronavirus in China](https://assure-test.com/discovery-of-hku5-cov-2-a-novel-coronavirus-in-china/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there are any human cases reported anywhere globally of HKU5-CoV-2.\n\nQuestion resolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), especially the World Health Organization or US Centers for Disease Control.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA novel bat coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, has been identified and is part of the Merbecovirus family, which includes the MERS virus. Research published in the journal 'Cell' confirms that the virus can bind to human ACE2 receptors and infect human airway and organoid cultures in laboratory settings. However, studies also indicate that its cell-entry efficiency is significantly lower than that of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
