  "information": "The University of Michigan's final Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) for May 2025 was 52.2, the same as the final reading for April. This followed a decline from 64.7 in February and 57.0 in March, marking a nearly 30% drop since January. The index's components also declined in April, with the Current Economic Conditions Index falling to 59.8 and the Economic Expectations Index dropping to 47.3. Consumers' short-term (one-year) inflation expectations reported in the survey rose to 6.5% in April, the highest since November 1981, while long-term inflation expectations increased to 4.4%. Historically, from 2010 to 2019, index increases of 8 points or more in a single month occurred less than 3% of the time.\n\nAccording to ADP data, U.S. private-sector hiring slowed significantly in May 2025, with only 37,000 jobs added, the slowest pace in over two years. Job losses were noted in business services, manufacturing, and education. A separate University of Michigan survey shows consumers expect unemployment to climb. Data on consumer behavior shows personal spending rose by 0.2% last month, while the savings rate increased to 4.9% in March, the highest level in nearly a year. Following the end of the pandemic-era payment pause on student loans, delinquencies jumped from 1% to 7.74%. In contrast to the University of Michigan's findings, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 98 in May from 85.7 in the prior month.\n\nThe ongoing trade war with China is a frequently cited source of uncertainty for American consumers, with the U.S. having doubled steel tariffs. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller has outlined a potential path to interest rate cuts later in the year, but noted that considerable uncertainty remains around the level of tariffs. Waller also largely dismissed the high inflation expectations recorded in the University of Michigan survey, stating a preference for market-based measures and professional forecasts.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 23 days (until Friday, June 27, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the May 2025 final ICS was 52.2; without an unusually large rebound, June will likely be ≤60.0.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Labor data stays soft (e.g., weak payrolls, higher jobless rate), tariff headlines remain negative, and inflation expectations stay elevated. June preliminary prints in the low-to-mid 50s and the final lands around 52–58.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A positive macro surprise (cool May CPI, stronger-than-feared payrolls, easing gas prices, or tariff de-escalation) triggers a sharp rebound in sentiment. June preliminary jumps to ~60–62 and the final lands >60.",
    "rationale": "Starting point: The May final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (ICS) is 52.2 (same as April), down from 64.7 in February and 57.0 in March. To exceed 60.0 in June requires roughly an 8-point month-over-month increase. Historically, from 2010–2019, 8+ point one-month gains occurred under 3% of the time. While post-2020 volatility has been higher, such jumps are still uncommon. Signals tilting lower: • ADP shows very weak private hiring in May (37k), with job losses in several sectors. • The Michigan survey indicates consumers expect unemployment to rise. • Real-side strain: personal spending slowed to +0.2% last month, savings rate rose to 4.9%, and delinquencies climbed after the student-loan pause ended. • Inflation expectations in the Michigan survey were elevated in April (1-year 6.5%, long-term 4.4%), which tends to depress sentiment. Signals tilting higher: • The Conference Board’s consumer confidence index jumped to 98 in May from 85.7, suggesting some households are feeling better; historically the two series correlate, though they frequently diverge in level and month-to-month changes. • Fed communication has kept rate-cut hopes alive later this year, which could boost expectations if inflation data cooperates. Status-quo weighting: Good forecasting puts extra weight on persistence. With May at 52.2, a typical month would show only a small move; getting above 60 requires an unusually large rebound, and prelim-to-final revisions are usually modest (often within ~1–2 points), so even a prelim below 60 would make a >60 final unlikely. Why not higher: Crossing 60 from 52.2 demands a near–8 point jump, which is rare, and near-term labor and tariff news flow has been a headwind. Why not lower: The sizable Conference Board bounce and the possibility of a benign May CPI print or solid payrolls create meaningful upside risk; after sharp declines, partial rebounds are not unusual. What would change my view: • Up: June preliminary Michigan reading ≥58, a soft May CPI (especially core), strong payrolls without wage overheating, falling gasoline prices, or clear tariff de-escalation. • Down: June preliminary ≤55, a hot CPI, rising unemployment, equity market weakness, or escalating trade tensions/inflation expectations.",
