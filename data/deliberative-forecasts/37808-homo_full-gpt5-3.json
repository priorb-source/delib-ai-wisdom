    "review": "Both forecasters make strong inertia-based cases: the DV program is mid‑cycle, State’s IA is historically stable, and even during 2017–2021 the DV instructions pages persisted. I agree their main downside is a URL/path change or redirect that may not satisfy the strict “at this location” criterion. They also correctly downplay the relevance of broader immigration actions and DEI‑site directives to this specific page. One nuance I’d add is the wording of the criterion (“with instructions for registering”): if State replaces the page with a termination/closure notice that strips instructions, it could fail even if the URL remains live. They mention this risk but I weight it slightly more than they do, while still considering it small on a ~6‑week horizon.",
    "rationale": "Baseline factors favor Yes: DV‑2026 results were just released (May 2025), processing runs through Sept 2026, and the Step 1 instructions page typically remains up year‑round with “entry closed” messaging. travel.state.gov URLs for core visa content are sticky, and sudden removal within ~6 weeks is unlikely. Legislative termination before July 1 is improbable given bicameral passage, implementation, and subsequent web updates; even then, agencies often keep or revise pages rather than immediately deleting them.\nDownside risks: (1) a path/slug change or consolidation that yields a 404 or only a redirect at the exact URL; (2) content replaced with a short notice lacking “instructions for registering,” failing the criterion; (3) transient downtime at the instant of check. These are collectively low probability but non‑zero.\nGiven the short horizon and strong institutional inertia, I’m nudging up slightly from my prior 89%. I remain a hair below the other forecasters due to the strict wording of the resolution (“at this location” and “with instructions”), which leaves a bit of tail risk if State alters the page or IA in late June.\nNet: modest upward adjustment, reflecting high likelihood the exact URL remains live with instructions through July 1.",
