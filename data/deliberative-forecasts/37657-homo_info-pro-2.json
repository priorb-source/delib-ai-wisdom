    "review": "The other forecasters provided compelling arguments that have caused me to revise my initial forecast downwards. Forecaster 2 introduced a critical piece of biological evidence I had not weighed: that while HKU5-CoV-2 can bind to human ACE2 receptors, its cell-entry efficiency is 'significantly lower' than that of SARS-CoV-2. This is a strong, mechanistic reason to doubt the likelihood of a successful spillover. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly convincing due to their use of a reference class. The base rate they cited—that only two of roughly 50 novel bat coronaviruses discovered since 2000 led to human cases within a year—provides a powerful quantitative anchor. Their reasoning to adjust this low base rate for the extremely short time frame is a robust method that I find highly persuasive.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 2% down to 1%. My initial forecast was too high, based on a general sense of tail risk without being sufficiently anchored in data. The arguments from the other forecasters provided that anchor. Specifically, Forecaster 3's base rate argument suggests that for a generic novel bat coronavirus, the annual probability of a detected human case is low (~4%), and for a 45-day window, this would imply a probability of less than 1%. I am combining this with the specific evidence from Forecaster 2 that HKU5-CoV-2 has a low cell-entry efficiency, which provides a strong reason to believe this specific virus is not an outlier with a higher-than-average risk. I am setting my forecast at 1%, slightly above what the raw base rate might suggest, primarily to account for one factor: today's enhanced genomic surveillance systems are far more sensitive than those that existed during most of the period from which the base rate is derived. This increases the probability that a rare, single spillover event would be *detected* and reported, compared to previous years. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast in light of the new evidence but keeping it at 1% to account for this increased detection capability.",
