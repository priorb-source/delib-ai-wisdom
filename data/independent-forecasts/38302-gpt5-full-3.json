  "information": "China's Consumer Price Index (CPI) has registered three consecutive months of year-on-year deflation: -0.7% in February, -0.1% in March, and -0.1% in April 2025. The Producer Price Index (PPI), a measure of factory-gate prices, has also shown sustained deflationary pressure, declining for 31 consecutive months. In April, the PPI fell by 2.7% year-on-year, the largest decline in six months. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy, has remained positive but low, at around +0.5% year-on-year.\n\nChina's manufacturing activity contracted for the second consecutive month in May, with the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) standing at 49.5, below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. The non-manufacturing PMI also showed a slight decline to 50.3 in May from 50.4 in the previous month. In the property sector, new-home sales from the 100 largest developers fell by 8.6% year-on-year in May, following an 8.7% drop in April.\n\nSpecific components influencing China's inflation data include energy and food prices. Brent crude oil averaged $84 in May 2025, a 4% increase from a year earlier. However, the year-on-year change in domestic energy prices remained negative. Pork prices, a key component of the food basket, also remained lower than a year ago due to high inventories. On the policy front, the People's Bank of China implemented a 10 basis point reserve requirement ratio (RRR) cut in mid-May.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 10–14 days (NBS May CPI likely around June 12; FRED series typically updates within a few days after).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — another slightly negative y/y headline CPI print (around -0.1%), extending the deflation streak to a 4th month.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Headline CPI ticks up to 0.0% to +0.2% y/y as May holiday services demand and some energy pass-through offset food weakness; or base effects turn marginally favorable versus May 2024.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Food deflation (notably pork) and still-negative domestic energy prices outweigh modest core/services firmness; weak demand, property drag, and PPI deflation keep headline below 0% y/y.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/status quo: Headline CPI has been negative for three straight months (-0.7% Feb, -0.1% Mar, -0.1% Apr). PPI remains deeply negative (-2.7% y/y in Apr), suggesting ongoing downstream price pressures. PMI dipped below 50 in May (49.5), property sales are weak, and policy easing (RRR cut) is modest with limited immediate CPI impact. Core CPI is slightly positive (~+0.5% y/y), implying the negative headline is largely from food and energy.\n- Components: Research notes domestic energy prices remained negative y/y despite Brent averaging ~4% higher y/y in May, indicating limited pass-through and/or regulated prices. Pork prices remain lower y/y on high inventories, a key drag within food. These factors favor another small negative headline print.\n- Base effects: Not strongly deflationary or inflationary for May; with headline near zero, small shocks can flip the sign. The May Day holiday could have lifted services prices, but services/core have been subdued and likely insufficient to overwhelm food/energy drags.\n- Why not higher: The balance of evidence (food and domestic energy deflation, weak demand, negative PPI) still leans slightly toward a negative headline.\n- Why not lower: It is a knife-edge near 0%. Energy’s y/y comparison has firmed a bit, core is positive, and holiday-related services could nudge the headline to 0 or +0.1. Small revisions or rounding could matter for the FRED series.\n- What would move me: I’d lower the Yes probability if high-frequency data showed clear May gains in pork/vegetables or stronger-than-expected services/fuel price increases, or signs of faster pass-through from higher crude. I’d raise it if food deflation deepened, domestic fuel prices stayed clearly negative y/y, or if additional weak activity data pointed to softer services inflation.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
