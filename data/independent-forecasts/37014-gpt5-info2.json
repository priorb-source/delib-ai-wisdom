  "information": "National polling data indicates that support for Reform UK is between 24% and 27%. Some local polls have suggested a surge in support for the party in Kent, and a number of local councillors have defected to join Reform UK.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 10–12 days (election on 1 May 2025; results likely within 1–2 days after)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Conservatives remain the largest group (likely No Overall Control overall)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform polls strongly but lacks full candidate coverage/ground game and finishes second in many single‑member divisions. Conservatives retain pluralities across much of rural Kent; Labour and Lib Dems pick up urban/semi‑urban divisions. Result: someone else (likely Conservatives) ends with the most seats, or a tight multi‑party NOC with Conservatives narrowly ahead.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Reform fields a near‑full slate and converts national polling into first‑place finishes across coastal/working‑class divisions (e.g., Thanet, Dover, Swale, Folkestone & Hythe, parts of Dartford/Gravesham/Ashford). The Conservative vote collapses, Labour/Lib Dems split the centre‑left, and Reform tops enough three‑way races to finish with the most seats.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: In 2021 the Conservatives dominated Kent County Council. Even with current national headwinds for the Conservatives, local elections with single‑member divisions and incumbency typically change more slowly than national polls, so the default is still that Conservatives remain the largest group or the council falls into No Overall Control with Conservatives narrowly ahead.\n\nEvidence for a Reform breakthrough: National polls put Reform at roughly 24–27%. Local coverage (e.g., KentOnline citing an Electoral Calculus model) suggests a strong Reform showing and there have been local councillor defections to Reform. Kent has multiple coastal/Blue‑Wall‑ish areas where Reform could be competitive if the Conservative vote collapses.\n\nReasons to discount a Reform plurality: (1) Ground game and candidate coverage — Reform historically fields fewer local candidates and underperforms its national vote share in local contests; without an almost full slate across Kent, winning the most seats is arithmetically very hard. (2) FPTP translation — Reform’s vote may be broad but not efficiently concentrated; they could place second a lot. (3) Incumbency and opposition targeting — Labour and Lib Dems have established local operations in many Kent divisions (LDs in parts of west Kent; Labour in urban areas), which can convert fragmented right‑of‑centre votes into wins. (4) Model uncertainty — seat‑level MRPs for local councils have a mixed track record and often assume uniform candidate presence and turnout patterns that may not hold.\n\nWhy not higher: The combination of candidate‑coverage risk, FPTP inefficiency, and incumbency advantages makes a Reform plurality a stretch even at 25%+ polling. Why not lower: The Conservatives’ collapse plus Reform’s national momentum and specific coastal strengths create a plausible path to a narrow plurality, and at least one local model points that way.\n\nWhat would move me up: Confirmation that Reform is fielding a full or near‑full slate of credible candidates in Kent divisions; further local polling showing Reform leading on vote share in Kent; visible local campaign infrastructure and endorsements in key coastal divisions. What would move me down: Evidence of patchy Reform candidate coverage, internal disorganisation, or tactical voting pacts/coordination among Labour/Lib Dem/Greens; late polling showing Conservatives or Labour clearly ahead in Kent.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
