  "information": "Recent changes to Level 4 advisories for other nations have been linked to specific security deteriorations. The advisory for South Sudan was elevated to Level 4 on March 8, 2025, which coincided with the ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel from the capital, Juba. The Level 4 advisory for the Democratic Republic of Congo cites high levels of violent crime, including armed robbery and kidnapping. The State Department also applies Level 4 warnings to sub-regions within countries, such as several states in Mexico and the Gaza Strip, due to localized risks of crime and armed conflict.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Niger maintains its current travel advisory level (likely Level 3)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security situation in Niger remains at its current baseline level of concern. The US State Department determines that existing risks from terrorism, crime, and limited infrastructure, while serious, do not warrant escalation to the most severe advisory level. No major incidents targeting Americans occur, and there is no ordered departure of US government personnel.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant acute security deterioration occurs in Niger before July 1st. This could include: a major terrorist attack affecting Western interests, kidnapping of US citizens, a violent coup attempt, targeted attacks on Americans, or a security collapse that prompts the US government to order departure of non-emergency personnel from the country - similar to what triggered South Sudan's Level 4 advisory in March 2025.",
    "rationale": "Niger faces substantial ongoing security challenges including terrorism, crime, and limited medical care as noted in the question background. However, these conditions have persisted for some time and likely already inform its current advisory level (presumably Level 3 - Reconsider Travel). The key insight from my research assistant is that Level 4 escalations typically respond to acute deteriorations, such as South Sudan's March 2025 upgrade following ordered departure of US personnel. Good forecasting favors status quo outcomes because: (1) bureaucratic advisory systems are sticky and change infrequently, (2) the 2-month timeframe is relatively short, and (3) the world typically changes gradually. Why not lower than 20%: Niger's region is genuinely unstable with active terrorist groups, recent political upheaval (2023 coup), and the assistant's report confirms Level 4 changes do happen (South Sudan example). The security fundamentals are poor enough that an acute incident is plausible. Why not higher: An upgrade requires a specific acute trigger, not just ongoing poor conditions. The current advisory level presumably already accounts for known baseline risks. There's no indication of imminent deterioration. What would change my forecast: Higher if reports emerge of attacks on Americans, ordered personnel departure, major kidnappings, or coup attempts. Lower if security stabilizes or successful counter-terrorism operations occur.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Niger receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Niger Faces Growing Travel Risks: U.S. Travel Advisory Highlights Terrorism, Crime, and Limited Medical Care for Tourists in the Country](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/niger-faces-growing-travel-risks-u-s-travel-advisory-highlights-terrorism-crime-and-limited-medical-care-for-tourists-in-the-country/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Niger has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Niger.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nRecent changes to Level 4 advisories for other nations have been linked to specific security deteriorations.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
