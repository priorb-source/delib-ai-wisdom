    "review": "Both forecasters raise critical points I need to address. First, there's an apparent discrepancy in the question - the title says 'March 2025' but the resolution criteria clearly states 'June 2025.' Given today is May 21, 2025, and resolution occurs after July 1, 2025, the question must be about JUNE 2025. This means the March 28 Florida incident is merely historical context, not directly relevant to the outcome month.\n\nForecaster 3 raises an especially important point I underweighted: military events often don't appear in NUFORC at all - they remain in military/AARO channels. This substantially reduces the relevance of military encounters to this forecast. Additionally, the ocean-adjacent location issue could affect Florida's count.\n\nAll three of us correctly identified that ties resolve to No, but with only 8-12 pilot reports nationally per month, the probability of ties is quite high. If Florida gets 1-2 reports, California likely gets 0-2, making ties or California wins quite probable.\n\nMost critically: we have NO specific information about June 2025. The March incident doesn't tell us anything predictive about June. We're essentially forecasting on pure base rates.",
    "rationale": "Correcting my analysis for June 2025 (not March): With no June-specific information, I must rely entirely on base rates. NUFORC logs 8-12 pilot reports nationally per month. California and Florida are the two leading states for pilot-specific reports, with California having a slight edge (36,286 total reports vs Florida's 8,623 suggests stronger overall aviation reporting infrastructure).\n\nKey factors lowering my forecast:\n1. We have zero June 2025-specific information\n2. Military encounters may not appear in NUFORC at all\n3. Ties are highly probable with such low counts and resolve to No\n4. California maintains a baseline structural advantage\n5. With roughly 8-12 reports split among 50 states, most getting 0-1, the probability any specific state is the unique leader is inherently low\n\nKey factors preventing lower forecast:\n1. Florida is genuinely one of the top two states for pilot reports\n2. Random variation could favor Florida in any given month\n3. Florida has substantial military and commercial aviation activity\n\nI'm revising down from 38% to 33% to better align with the pure base rate scenario and account for tie probability.",
