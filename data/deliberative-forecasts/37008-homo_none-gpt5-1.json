    "review": "Forecaster 2 makes a strong point about typical repair/procurement timelines for power infrastructure exceeding four weeks and Samoa’s precedent for rolling SoE extensions, which I had considered but probably weighted a bit less. However, their 60% seems high given the default outcome is No without an active extension and we lack evidence of ongoing severe outages or intent to extend. Forecaster 3’s framing aligns closely with mine: default No, but a short extension decided near expiry is quite plausible; they also note the (low) possibility of a different emergency overlapping the date. I find F3’s 40% more consistent with the evidence-free environment and decision timing norms. The main new emphasis I take from F2/F3 is that even a brief, last-minute extension would flip this market, and infrastructure fixes often overshoot initial timelines, nudging probability up modestly.",
    "rationale": "Baseline remains No because the proclamation currently ends Apr 29. An extension requires affirmative action that we have no evidence for yet. That said, energy crises often persist beyond initial expectations, and Samoa has institutional/behavioral precedent for month-by-month SoE extensions when problems are unresolved. With nine days left and decisions often made close to expiry, a short extension covering Apr 30 is plausible. Balancing these, I move up slightly from 35% to reflect the stickiness of energy constraints and the low hurdle (any extension past Apr 29 suffices), but stay below even odds due to the explicit end date, political cost of prolonging emergency powers, and lack of signals indicating the crisis remains acute.",
