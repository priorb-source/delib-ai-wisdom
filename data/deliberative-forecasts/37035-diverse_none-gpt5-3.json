    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize status quo inertia, CDC’s high bar for Level 3+, vaccine mitigability for yellow fever, and the short timeline—points consistent with my initial view. They add useful calibration: Level 3+ is typically reserved for exceptional, less-mitigable threats; rapid escalation would require urban spread, traveler risk, or supply constraints. Forecaster 2’s 15% feels a bit high given CDC’s historical handling of yellow fever outbreaks (e.g., Brazil 2017–2018 largely stayed at Level 2). Forecaster 3’s 12% is closer to my prior but still slightly high given the 5–6 week window and lack of clear signals (e.g., PAHO/WHO emergency escalation, urban transmission, vaccine shortages). Their reasoning doesn’t introduce new concrete evidence, but it reinforces the need not to be too low because outbreaks can pivot quickly.",
    "rationale": "Key considerations unchanged: (1) Short window (~5–6 weeks) strongly favors no change; institutional advisories are sticky. (2) CDC historically uses Level 3 sparingly and prefers Level 2 plus strong vaccination guidance for vaccine-preventable vector-borne diseases, even during sizable outbreaks. (3) To justify Level 3 nationwide, we’d likely need sustained urban transmission in major travel hubs and/or vaccine access problems that meaningfully raise traveler risk; absent that, Level 2 is typical. (4) The headline about an ‘economic emergency’ suggests domestic concern but is not, by itself, indicative of CDC escalation. Triggers for an upward revision before June 1 would be credible reports of rapid urban spread, significant traveler cases, PAHO/WHO escalation, or widespread vaccine shortages/contraindications. Given peers’ arguments and acknowledging tail risks, I nudge slightly upward from my prior to reflect uncertainty in fast-moving outbreaks, but remain below their estimates due to base rates and timing.",
