    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2.5 months, assuming the event takes place in August 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The fight between Johnny Walker and Azamat Murzakanov does not take place as scheduled at UFC 316, or if it does, Azamat Murzakanov wins. This reflects the multiple paths to a 'No' resolution, including fight cancellation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The fight is cancelled a week prior to the event due to an injury sustained by one of the fighters. Alternatively, the fight proceeds, but Azamat Murzakanov is able to bypass Walker's reach, get into the pocket, and secure a knockout victory in the second round.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The fight proceeds as scheduled. Johnny Walker successfully utilizes his significant height and reach advantage to control the distance with kicks and long-range strikes, preventing Murzakanov from landing his power shots and winning a clear unanimous decision.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is based on two primary factors: the probability of the fight taking place as scheduled, and the likely outcome of the stylistic matchup if it does.\n\nFirst, there is a non-trivial chance the fight does not happen. UFC fights have a historical cancellation rate due to injuries, weight-cutting issues, or other unforeseen circumstances. I estimate approximately a 20% chance this specific bout is altered or cancelled, which would result in a 'No' resolution. This places an initial ceiling on the probability of 'Yes' at around 80%.\n\nSecond, analyzing the matchup if the fight proceeds, I give Johnny Walker a slight edge. His primary advantages are physical: he possesses an 8-inch height and an 11-inch reach advantage over Murzakanov. This is a massive disparity in the light heavyweight division and should allow him to control the fight's range if he maintains discipline. Furthermore, Walker has faced a significantly higher level of competition, including multiple former and future title challengers. Murzakanov, while undefeated, has not yet been tested against the division's top tier.\n\nThe forecast is not higher because of Walker's known vulnerabilities. He has a suspect chin, having been knocked out four times in his career. Murzakanov is a compact, powerful puncher, and his path to victory involves closing the distance and landing a fight-ending blow, a plausible scenario given Walker's occasional defensive lapses. I rate the conditional probability of Walker winning, given the fight happens, at approximately 60%.\n\nThe forecast is not lower because Murzakanov's strategy is high-risk. Closing an 11-inch reach gap against a dynamic and unorthodox striker like Walker is extremely difficult and exposes him to significant damage. Walker's diverse kicking arsenal and power at range make him a dangerous opponent for a shorter fighter pressing forward. Murzakanov's undefeated record has been built against a lower caliber of opponent, and this represents a major step up in competition.\n\nTo update this forecast, I would need to see the official betting lines, news about either fighter's training camp (e.g., reports of strong conditioning or, conversely, injuries), or a change in the event's status. Confirmation that both fighters have made weight and the fight is officially proceeding would increase my probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Johnny Walker defeat Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316?\n\nQuestion background:\nPlease see [UFC Stats](http://ufcstats.com/fight-details/dab807a99d295832) for statistical details of the two opponents.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Johnny Walker defeats Azamat Murzakanov at [UFC 316](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_316).\n\nIf Walker does not fight anyone at UFC 316 or fights someone else, this resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-26.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
