    "review": "Both forecasters raised crucial historical context I had not considered. Forecaster 2's point that Kadyrov made nearly identical statements about stepping down in 2017, 2018, and 2022 without actually resigning is the most significant new information. This pattern strongly suggests these statements are political theater rather than genuine intentions for immediate resignation. This historical precedent substantially weakens the evidentiary weight of the May 6 statement. Both forecasters also correctly emphasize that six days have passed with no follow-up actions or credible reporting of succession planning, which reinforces the status quo interpretation. Forecaster 3's observation that in Russia such transitions are 'usually telegraphed by credible leaks or confirmed statements' is also valuable - the absence of such signals is telling.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I overweighted the significance of the May 6 statement in isolation. The historical precedent of similar statements in 2017, 2018, and 2022 that did not result in resignation is extremely relevant base rate information that materially changes my assessment. This establishes a clear pattern where such public statements serve political functions (demonstrating loyalty, extracting concessions, or managing speculation) rather than signaling imminent departure. The six-day period since the statement with no reported follow-through further supports this interpretation. However, I maintain that the probability should not be as low as 10% because: (1) persistent health rumors add genuine uncertainty beyond political theater, (2) even repeated patterns can eventually break, especially if health circumstances have deteriorated, and (3) rapid transitions, while rare, are possible in Russia's centralized system. The 20-day timeframe remains extremely constraining. I am adjusting my forecast downward to better account for the historical pattern while maintaining recognition of tail-risk scenarios involving sudden health crises or pre-planned transitions.",
