    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises an important point I underweighted: Nord Stream 2 is physically inoperable, significantly reducing practical pressure for urgent sanctions relief. Forecaster 3 provides the most detailed analysis, noting that OFAC can implement quickly once decided and that Congress cannot easily block such action. However, Forecaster 3's 28% seems to overweight the single Politico report. A critical observation: we're now 13 days past that April 23 article with no follow-up reporting. If the White House were seriously moving toward implementation by July 1, we'd likely see additional signals by now - leaks, diplomatic activity, or preparatory messaging. The absence of such signals is itself informative. Forecaster 3 correctly notes that Germany/EU no longer depend on this pipeline for energy security, which further reduces external pressure for rapid action. Both forecasters agree on the strong status quo bias and high political costs, which I also emphasized.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm adjusting downward from my initial 18%. The non-operational status of the pipeline is more significant than I originally weighted - it means there's no immediate functional reason to lift sanctions quickly. The lack of any follow-up reporting since the April 23 Politico article (13 days of silence) suggests the internal debate may not have progressed toward concrete action. If this were seriously under consideration for implementation within 56 days, we'd expect to see preparatory diplomatic activity, additional leaks, or public messaging to soften political ground. The single Politico report indicates the topic is on the table but doesn't establish momentum toward actual delisting. The strong status quo, combined with high political costs, limited practical urgency (inoperable pipeline), reduced external pressure (EU doesn't need it), and absence of follow-up signals, all point toward a lower probability. However, I'm not going as low as Forecaster 2's 10% because the documented White House debate and executive authority to act quickly mean this cannot be dismissed as extremely unlikely.",
