    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my reasoning: strong status quo and incentives; primary risks are legal/regulatory plus the brittleness of the “every day” requirement; small operational tail risks. The most useful addition is the emphasis that an adverse Nevada ruling would most likely lead to targeted geoblocking rather than a nationwide halt, which narrows the most plausible legal downside. They also explicitly flag near-term risk concentration in early June and the possibility of a TRO/injunction or payments/ops disruption—good to keep on the radar, though not obviously higher than I’d already assumed.",
    "rationale": "Given the additional framing that the Nevada case is likely to produce jurisdiction-specific remedies (geoblocking) rather than a nationwide suspension, the main regulatory tail that would force a pause across the entire platform looks less likely. The CFTC-driven nationwide risk remains possible but low on a one-month horizon, and MLB’s public concerns don’t translate into direct regulatory authority. Operationally, Kalshi has demonstrated daily MLB listings since mid-April without visible gaps, suggesting a low per-day failure rate; across 30 days, that still contributes a few percentage points of risk. The requirement for an uninterrupted streak keeps me below the low-90s, but the geoblocking insight nudges me slightly higher than my prior. Net: modest upward adjustment.",
