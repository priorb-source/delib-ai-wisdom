    "no_outcome_scenario": "The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without Beto O'Rourke making any formal announcement of his candidacy for the 2026 US Senate race. He may be weighing his options, deciding against another run after three consecutive statewide/national losses, or simply planning for a later announcement date outside the resolution window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Beto O'Rourke holds a press conference or releases a social media statement before July 1, 2025, formally declaring his intention to run for the US Senate in 2026. This could be prompted by favorable internal polling, encouragement from key donors, or a perceived political opening.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the lack of precedent and strategic incentive for a candidate to announce a Senate campaign this early, specifically within the next 39 days. The status quo is that Mr. O'Rourke is not a candidate. He has suffered three high-profile electoral defeats (Senate 2018, Presidential Primary 2020, Governor 2022), which increases the political cost and difficulty of launching a fourth major campaign.\n\nThe provided quote ('if' Texans want him to run... 'yes I will') is a standard non-committal statement that keeps his options open without committing him to a run. There are currently no public indicators of an impending campaign launch, such as FEC filings, major staff hires, or the formation of an exploratory committee. While he remains a prominent figure with a strong fundraising base, the most logical course of action, should he decide to run, would be to announce later in 2025 or in early 2026, closer to the election.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 8% because Mr. O'Rourke is a known political operator who has run for this office before, and his own words confirm he is at least considering it. A surprise early announcement, while unlikely, is not impossible. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the short time frame for this question is the single largest constraint. The burden of proof is on an action (announcing) happening, which is less likely than the continuation of the status quo (not announcing) within such a specific and narrow window. \n\nI would increase my probability forecast if credible news reports emerged of O'Rourke hiring senior campaign staff or filing exploratory paperwork. I would decrease it if he explicitly endorsed another potential candidate or made a definitive statement that he would not be running in 2026.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beto O'Rourke announce his candidacy for US Senator from Texas before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFort Worth Star-Telegram: [Beto O’Rourke says ‘if’ Texans want him to run for U.S. Senate, ‘yes I will'](https://www.star-telegram.com/opinion/bud-kennedy)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Beto O'Rourke announces his candidacy for US Senator from Texas before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
