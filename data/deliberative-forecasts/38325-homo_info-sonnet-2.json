    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides critical information I lacked: the second estimate revised upward to -0.2%, showing a 0.1 pp improvement. This upward revision trend is significant evidence that shifts my assessment. However, Forecaster 2's 25% seems too pessimistic given we're now even closer to zero and have momentum in the right direction. Forecaster 3's 47% captures the closeness to zero threshold but appears unaware of the second estimate data. Their reasoning about comprehensive data incorporation in third estimates is sound, though their forecast seems anchored more to the advance estimate's distance from zero rather than the current -0.2% position. The key tension is between the encouraging upward revision trend versus the need for a 0.3 pp additional revision from -0.2% to positive territory, which exceeds the typical 0.1-0.2 pp second-to-third revision magnitude.",
    "rationale": "The second estimate revision to -0.2% is crucial new information that materially changes my analysis. This represents: (1) confirmation of upward revision momentum, (2) closer proximity to zero than my initial assessment assumed, and (3) evidence that as more complete data is incorporated, the reading improves. However, reaching positive territory still requires a 0.3 pp upward revision from the second to third estimate, which is larger than the typical 0.1-0.2 pp magnitude for such revisions. The total advance-to-third revision would need to be 0.4+ pp, approaching the upper end of the historical 0.5 pp average absolute revision. The upward trend supports optimism, but the magnitude required tempers it. Balancing the encouraging revision direction against the atypical size needed for a sign change, I'm updating upward from 38% to 42%. This reflects that we're closer to the threshold with positive momentum, but still need an unusually large second-to-third revision to achieve a Yes outcome.",
