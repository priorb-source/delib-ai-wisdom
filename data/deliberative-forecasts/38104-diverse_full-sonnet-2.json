    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I reached similar conclusions (65% vs 85%), both emphasizing the strong law enforcement response. However, Forecaster 3 raises compelling arguments I hadn't fully considered. The most important is the probability compounding issue: we need BOTH fugitives captured, not just one. If each has a 75-80% individual capture probability, multiplying them yields 56-64% for both. Forecaster 3 also correctly identifies a critical selection effect - these aren't random members of the original 10; they're specifically the two who survived 14 days of intensive manhunting, suggesting superior evasion capabilities. Forecaster 2's optimism about 'momentum' may underweight how manhunt effectiveness typically declines over time as fugitives establish themselves. However, Forecaster 3's 45% seems overly pessimistic given the unprecedented resources, high rewards, dismantled support networks, and 32 remaining days - more than double the time elapsed. The truth likely lies between our positions.",
    "rationale": "Re-evaluating with the probability compounding framework: I estimate Groves (convicted murderer with no escape history) has roughly 75-80% capture probability over 32 days, while Massey (serial escapee with three prior successes) has perhaps 65-75% probability. This yields a joint probability of 49-60% for capturing both. The selection effect is real - these two demonstrated superior evasion skills by lasting 14 days when their peers didn't. However, several factors support staying in the mid-range rather than dropping to 45%: (1) The 14 accomplice arrests significantly degraded support infrastructure; (2) $100,000 in total rewards creates strong incentives; (3) 32 days is substantial time with sustained federal involvement; (4) Nearly 700 tips show active public engagement. Against staying at 65%: the compounding probability math is unavoidable, and Massey's three prior escapes represent genuine capability, not luck. I'm revising downward but not to Forecaster 3's level, as the resource intensity and time remaining are meaningful advantages.",
