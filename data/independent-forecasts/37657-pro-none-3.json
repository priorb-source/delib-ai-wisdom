    "no_outcome_scenario": "HKU5-CoV-2 is a real virus found in an animal reservoir, but it either lacks the necessary adaptations to infect humans or any potential spillover event is not detected and officially reported by a credible source like the WHO or CDC before the resolution date. The status quo of zero reported human cases continues.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A zoonotic spillover event occurs, likely through human contact with an infected animal host. The infected individual develops symptoms, is identified by healthcare systems, and laboratory testing confirms infection with HKU5-CoV-2. This case is then officially reported by a national or international public health agency before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the extremely low base rate for newly discovered animal coronaviruses causing human infections. The vast majority of such viruses never make the zoonotic leap. The primary driver for this low probability is the profound lack of information; my research assistant found no additional data, and the virus is not mentioned by major public health organizations like the WHO or CDC, or in reputable scientific literature. The only provided source is a non-primary one, which raises questions about the significance of the discovery. Given the short timeframe of about 1.5 months, the status quo of zero reported human cases is overwhelmingly likely to hold. A 'Yes' outcome would require a chain of low-probability events to occur quickly: a spillover event, detection of the case, sequencing of the virus, and official reporting.While post-COVID-19 surveillance is heightened, which could increase detection chances, this is not enough to substantially raise the probability without more specific evidence about the virus's characteristics. My forecast is not lower than 1% to account for the stochastic nature of zoonotic spillovers, which are rare but not impossible. My forecast is not higher because there is currently no evidence to suggest this virus is a significant threat to human health, such as data on its receptor binding affinity or reports of unusual illness clusters. I would significantly increase my forecast if credible scientific or public health sources were to report on this virus, especially if they indicated it had adaptations for human infection. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if the initial report were debunked.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be any human cases of the novel coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Discovery of HKU5-CoV-2, a Novel Coronavirus in China](https://assure-test.com/discovery-of-hku5-cov-2-a-novel-coronavirus-in-china/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there are any human cases reported anywhere globally of HKU5-CoV-2.\n\nQuestion resolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), especially the World Health Organization or US Centers for Disease Control.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
