  "information": "The Bangladeshi interim government has publicly stated that securing Sheikh Hasina's extradition from India is a 'top priority.' A formal request for her extradition, along with supporting documents, was submitted to India in December 2024. As of February 2025, India had not officially responded to the request. A spokesperson for Bangladesh's foreign ministry indicated that a formal reminder would be sent to India regarding the extradition at an 'appropriate time' to be determined by the country's political leadership.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months. The outcome will be known by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Sheikh Hasina remains in India, and the Bangladeshi interim government's extradition request is not acted upon within the specified timeframe. The question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "India's government continues its current policy of delaying or not officially responding to the extradition request from Bangladesh. Citing legal complexities, political sensitivities, or simply through inaction, India does not hand Sheikh Hasina over before July 1, 2025. Concurrently, Sheikh Hasina, facing likely arrest and prosecution, refrains from making a voluntary return.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing intense diplomatic pressure from the new Bangladeshi government, or as a strategic move to build rapport with it, India's government fast-tracks the extradition process and hands Sheikh Hasina over to Bangladeshi authorities. Alternatively, Sheikh Hasina makes a calculated political decision to return voluntarily, believing it is the best way to rally her supporters and confront the charges against her.",
    "rationale": "The foundation of this forecast is the strong status quo and the very short timeframe for resolution. The current situation is that Sheikh Hasina is in India, and while Bangladesh has requested her extradition, India has not acted. My research indicates India had not officially responded to the December 2024 request as of February 2025, and there is no public information to suggest this has changed. Extradition of a high-profile political figure like a former head of government is a legally and diplomatically complex process that typically takes many months, if not years. It is highly improbable that this entire process would be initiated and completed within the specific six-week window between May 13 and July 1, 2025, especially given India's apparent reluctance to act so far. A voluntary return is also unlikely, given the significant personal and legal risks she would face upon arrival. The probability is not lower than 5% because of the inherent volatility of political situations; an unexpected deal between India and Bangladesh or a high-risk political gambit by Hasina herself cannot be entirely ruled out. She has publicly vowed to return, which keeps the possibility of a voluntary return alive, however slim. The probability is not higher because there is no concrete evidence of any movement on the extradition front, and the path of least resistance for all state actors involved is to maintain the current status quo beyond the resolution date. I would increase this forecast if India's Ministry of External Affairs made a public statement confirming their intent to expedite the extradition. I would decrease it if they formally denied the request.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sheikh Hasina return to Bangladesh before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFirstpost: [Bangladesh has turned into a ‘terrorist country’: Sheikh Hasina targets Yunus, vows to return](https://www.firstpost.com/world/bangladesh-has-turned-into-a-terrorist-country-sheikh-hasina-targets-yunus-vows-to-return-13878191.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sheikh Hasina after May 12, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of Bangladesh according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nThe circumstances of her entering Bangladeshi territory, whether voluntarily or due to her extradition from India, will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Bangladeshi interim government has publicly stated that securing Sheikh Hasina's extradition from India is a 'top priority.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
