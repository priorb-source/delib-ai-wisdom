    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 57 days (from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No bankruptcy filing. Chegg continues operations without filing for bankruptcy protection.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Chegg successfully secures additional financing or credit facilities to maintain liquidity through July 1st. The company continues implementing cost-cutting measures and business model adaptations to compete with AI tools. Management convinces creditors and stakeholders to provide additional time for restructuring efforts to take effect, avoiding the need for immediate bankruptcy protection.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Chegg faces an acute liquidity crisis within the next two months, unable to meet immediate debt obligations or maintain operations. Creditors demand payment that the company cannot provide, and management determines that Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection is the only viable path forward. The competitive pressure from AI tools like ChatGPT has accelerated revenue decline faster than anticipated, leaving no alternatives to a formal bankruptcy filing.",
    "rationale": "The timeframe is extremely short at only 57 days, which significantly constrains the probability. Even for companies facing serious challenges, bankruptcy filings in such condensed windows are rare. The WSJ article headline indicates Chegg has been severely impacted by ChatGPT, suggesting real structural challenges to their business model. However, the article title alone doesn't indicate imminent bankruptcy - many companies face existential competitive threats and manage to survive for extended periods through restructuring, financing, or adaptation. For a publicly traded company like Chegg to file bankruptcy, they would typically need to be in acute financial distress with immediate liquidity problems - unable to pay debts, meet payroll, or secure bridge financing. Public companies generally exhaust numerous alternatives before bankruptcy: raising capital through equity offerings, securing debt financing, selling assets, or negotiating with creditors. My research assistant provided no additional information about Chegg's specific financial condition, debt maturity schedule, or liquidity position. Without evidence of an immediate crisis requiring bankruptcy protection in the next 57 days, I must weight heavily toward the status quo outcome. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the timeframe is too short for most bankruptcy scenarios to materialize, (2) no specific evidence of acute distress in the immediate term, and (3) public companies have multiple tools to avoid bankruptcy. My forecast is not lower because: (1) the WSJ article suggests serious competitive damage, (2) AI displacement is a structural, not temporary, threat, and (3) if Chegg were already on the brink, 57 days could be sufficient. To increase my forecast, I would need evidence of: immediate liquidity problems, debt maturities in this window, or creditor actions forcing bankruptcy. To decrease it further, I would need evidence of recent successful financing, positive cash flow, or extended debt maturities.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chegg file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWall Street Journal: [How ChatGPT Brought Down an Online Education Giant](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-chatgpt-brought-down-an-online-education-giant-200b4ff2)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Chegg, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
