    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses are impressively thorough and methodologically sound. We converged on the same two-step framework: fight occurrence probability (~87%) and Pyfer win probability if it happens (~60%), yielding combined forecasts of 50-54%. Two arguments they raised merit consideration: First, Forecaster 3 correctly identified that Pyfer fighting in Newark, New Jersey provides a home advantage - this is a legitimate factor for an American fighter that I underweighted. Home advantage in MMA, while subtle, can boost performance through crowd support and reduced travel stress. Second, Forecaster 3's point about a ~2% probability of a late replacement opponent is creative, though this scenario seems unlikely with 12 days remaining. The most significant oversight in my analysis was not explicitly factoring in the home advantage, which could reasonably add 1-3 percentage points to Pyfer's win probability. The convergence of three independent analyses around 50-54% also suggests this range captures the true uncertainty better than any single point estimate.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my original 50% forecast slightly underweighted Pyfer's advantages. The home advantage in Newark is a real factor that could provide a 1-2% boost to the overall probability. Additionally, while my reasoning about momentum, physical advantages, and recent form was sound, setting my estimate at exactly 50% may have been overly cautious. The other forecasters' consensus at 52-54%, combined with the home advantage factor, suggests a modest upward adjustment is warranted. However, I don't want to overcorrect - Gastelum remains a legitimate threat with his veteran experience and recent form (2-1 in last 3). The fight cancellation risk of ~13% is also meaningful given Pyfer's history of withdrawal. A forecast of 52% appropriately balances Pyfer's momentum and physical advantages against Gastelum's experience, while accounting for the non-trivial cancellation risk and the genuine competitiveness of this matchup.",
