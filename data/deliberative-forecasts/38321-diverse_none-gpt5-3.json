    "review": "Forecaster 2’s explicit conditioning on Trump being the sitting president is a useful clarification; absent that, the unconditional probability would be the product of (Trump is president) and (attendance | president). Given the date, that uncertainty should already be resolved, so I align with conditioning on him being president. Forecaster 3 adds a strong timing-based argument: at this proximity to a late-June summit, we’d typically expect clear signals or reporting if attendance were in doubt. I hadn’t fully weighted the “late-stage, no-contrary-signals” factor in my prior. Both emphasize precedent that Trump attended NATO summits in term one and tends to use them as a stage rather than forgoing them—points I agree with. The main pushback to Forecaster 3’s 90% is Trump’s history of late, unpredictable snubs of multilateral fora and his willingness to use absence as leverage—still a live risk that keeps me below 90%.",
    "rationale": "Conditioned on Trump being president, attendance is the default: U.S. presidents almost always go to NATO summits, and Trump himself attended prior ones despite criticism of the alliance. The incentives to attend are strong—maximum visibility to pressure allies and claim credit amid higher European defense spending. Given we are in early June, the absence (in this exercise) of reports suggesting a skip is informative; by now, there would usually be leaks or signaling if he intended to send a surrogate. That said, Trump’s unpredictability and demonstrated readiness to snub some multilateral events keep a nontrivial tail for a deliberate no-show or a last-minute domestic pretext. Net: I’m nudging my forecast up on the timing/absence-of-negative-signal consideration. Change: 77% -> 84% (+7pp).",
