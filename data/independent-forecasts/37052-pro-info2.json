  "information": "According to the University of Illinois Cline Center’s Coup d'État Project, the number of coups, attempts, and conspiracies has risen since 2021 to 14-16 events per year, compared to single-digit figures in the 2000s and 2010s. However, these figures remain below the averages of the 1960s and 1970s. The number of successful coups was seven in 2021 and five in 2024. A summary of historical data from the reports indicates that from 2020 to early 2025, Africa experienced nine notable coup events, of which seven were successful. Over a similar period, from 2022 to 2024, Latin America had three notable coup events, all of which were unsuccessful.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two months, as the question deadline is July 1, 2025, and today's date is April 25, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No successful coup occurs in any country in Africa or Latin America.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing political tensions and instability in several countries across both continents, particularly in the Sahel region of Africa, no group successfully overthrows a sitting executive before the deadline. Any coup attempts that may occur are quickly suppressed by loyalist forces or otherwise fail to gain control of the state.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A military junta in a politically unstable Sahel country, such as Chad or Sudan, successfully seizes power from the current government. The plotters detain the head of state, suspend the constitution, and announce control via state media, meeting little effective resistance and consolidating their rule.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an analysis of the recent base rate of coups against the very short timeframe for this question. The research provided indicates a significant increase in coup activity since 2021. The period from 2020 to early 2025 saw at least seven successful coups in Africa, an average of over 1.5 per year. This established pattern of instability, especially in the Sahel, is the primary reason for a non-trivial probability. However, the forecast window is only about two months. While the annual rate is high, the probability of an event occurring in a specific short period is naturally lower. A Poisson probability calculation suggests that a base rate of 1.6 successful coups per year yields approximately a 25% chance of at least one successful coup occurring in a 66-day period. This aligns with my assessment. The risk is heavily concentrated in Africa; Latin America has seen recent failed attempts but no successes, making it a much smaller contributor to the overall probability. My forecast is not higher because a 25% probability already reflects a high-risk environment; a higher number would imply a coup is almost expected in this narrow window, which is too strong a claim without specific intelligence of an imminent plot. My forecast is not lower because that would understate the demonstrated and persistent volatility that has led to multiple successful coups in the region annually over the past several years. I would increase my forecast upon credible reports of a brewing coup attempt or a significant political crisis in a high-risk country. I would decrease it following successful de-escalation of tensions or peaceful and stable political transitions in those same countries.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to [Powell & Thyne (2011, p. 252)](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf), a coup is \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\" In recent years, some of the coups in Africa have been:&#x20;\n\n* [Mali August 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Mali May 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Niger March 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Nigerien_coup_attempt) (attempt)\n* [Niger July 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nigerien_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Gabon August 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Gabonese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Chad January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%27Djamena_attack) (possible attempt)\n* [Burkina Faso January 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Burkina Faso September 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)&#x20;\n* [Guinea September 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n\nLatin America has had the following coup attempts in recent years:\n\n* [Peru self-coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Peruvian_self-coup_attempt), December 2022\n* [Brazil Congress attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack), January 2023\n* [Bolivia coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bolivian_coup_attempt), June 2024\n\nSee also: [VoA by the numbers Coups in Africa](https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is a successful coup d’état in any country on the African continent or Latin America before July 1, 2025, according to credible media reports. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nLatin America is defined as any country in North America or South America whose primary language is Spanish, Portuguese or French.\n\nA coup d’état (often shortened to \"coup\") is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) as an event in which a state's military or other components of its power structure overthrow the existing political authority.&#x20;\n\nA \"successful\" coup is defined as a coup in which the group or person attempting to seize power establishes control over both the government and military, and will be considered to have succeeded once any significant resistance to their authority has ceased.&#x20;\n\nA self-coup, [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup) as a political leader, having come to power through legal means, remaining in power through illegal means, will count. This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the University of Illinois Cline Center’s Coup d'État Project, the number of coups, attempts, and conspiracies has risen since 2021 to 14-16 events per year, compared to single-digit figures in the 2000s and 2010s.
