    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the right anchors: the U.S. share around the middle of the list is well below 50%, daily churn at rank ~250 is material, and FX/equity relative performance matter near the snapshot. I find that framing sound and consistent with my prior. Useful additions: the explicit focus on the 245–255 cluster composition as the key diagnostic and the emphasis on USD vs EUR/CNY as pivotal FX pairs. However, I’m cautious about two specific claims: (1) the assertion that Vladimir Potanin was #250 on May 29 looks inconsistent with his typical ranking (he’s usually far higher), so I treat that as unverified; and (2) the cited figures that 62% of ranks 200–300 are non-U.S. and a seasonal Q1–Q2 U.S. weakness weren’t in the provided research and lack sourcing here, so I discount them. Net: their general reasoning supports a sub-50% forecast with a modest bias toward No due to current non-U.S. occupancy and base rates, but the unsourced specifics don’t warrant a large adjustment.",
    "rationale": "My prior view: base rate for a U.S. billionaire at rank ~250 is roughly mid-30s given U.S. representation below 50% in the Bloomberg 500 and a broadly international mix around the median. The latest confirmed occupant we have (Apr 30: Devasini, Italy) is non-U.S., which, combined with short-horizon inertia, nudges odds below the base rate. Macro developments (equities up, tariff delay) appear broad-based rather than distinctly U.S.-skewed; any incremental U.S. tech strength likely affects higher ranks more than the median. FX could be the swing factor: a stronger USD would slightly raise the chance of a U.S. #250; the converse would lower it. The other forecasters’ arguments generally support this posture, but I discount the unverified specifics. Given that, I make a small downward adjustment to reflect the status quo non-U.S. median and the likelihood that U.S. share around the 200–300 band is closer to the mid-30s than 40%.",
