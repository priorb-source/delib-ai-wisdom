    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (eligible window is May 12–June 14, 2025; outcome known by June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — leader-to-leader calls are infrequent and most months pass without one, especially with adversaries",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "After the February 2025 call, White House/Kremlin communication continues via lower-level channels; any next leader call slips to late June or later (or occurs before May 12). Even if a call happens, one side does not issue an explicit acknowledgment, so it doesn’t count.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A concrete trigger (e.g., ceasefire or prisoner-swap negotiations, a battlefield crisis in Ukraine, or arms-control overture) prompts another Trump–Putin call in late May or early June, with both the White House and the Kremlin releasing readouts.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/hazard: Over a short 34‑day window, the base rate of at least one acknowledged head-of-state call is modest. Even with an active channel, leader calls typically occur on the order of every 2–4 months, not monthly. A Poisson‑style hazard consistent with 1 call per 3 months implies roughly a 30% chance in a 34‑day span before any adjustments.\n- Evidence raising odds: The February 2025 Trump–Putin call (per the provided background) shows the line is open and both sides are willing to acknowledge contact, which modestly boosts chances versus a cold channel. Trump’s personal style historically favors direct leader engagement.\n- Evidence lowering odds: Significant political/optics costs after the February call may make another near‑term call less attractive; the administration can route most business through envoys. Crucially, the resolution requires both sides to acknowledge the call; sometimes only one side issues a readout or the call remains unattributed, which reduces the effective probability of a qualifying event. There is no fixed, widely anticipated event in this specific 5‑week window that would force leader‑level contact.\n- Why not higher: Short window, adversarial relationship, and the both‑sides‑acknowledge requirement. No concrete, near‑dated catalysts known today.\n- Why not lower: The channel is demonstrably active in 2025 and Trump has a history of direct calls; a sudden Ukraine or detainee‑swap development could easily justify a leader call.\n- Updates I’d make: I would raise the forecast on credible reports of pending leader‑level talks, notable prisoner‑swap negotiations, or high‑level readouts hinting at an imminent call. I would lower it if the White House signals a pause on direct leader contact, if lower‑level channels are emphasized explicitly, or if reporting suggests any calls will be kept off‑record (thus unlikely to be acknowledged by both). The research assistant provided no additional information beyond the background, so the forecast relies on general base rates and incentives.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both Trump and Putin, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
