    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days (DOL/FRED release expected Thu, Jun 26, 2025 for the week ended Sat, Jun 21).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Slightly above 220,000, near the recent 4-week average (roughly low-220s).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Initial claims remain subdued (e.g., 212–220k). Seasonal factors may have anticipated more late-June layoffs than materialize, and the labor market remains tight enough to keep prints at or below 220k. Also possible: an initial 221k print is revised down to 220k or below on FRED.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A modest uptick in claims (e.g., 221–235k) driven by gradual labor-market cooling, late-June manufacturing retooling and school-year seasonal transitions that aren’t fully netted out by seasonal adjustment, or a small upward revision that nudges a ~219–220k initial print above 220k on FRED.",
    "rationale": "I’m anchoring on recent base rates and the slow-evolving nature of the labor market. Over the past couple of years, seasonally adjusted initial claims (ICSA) have mostly ranged in the 200–240k band, with many weeks clustering around the low-220s. The 220k threshold sits very close to the central tendency. Absent a clear shock, the best guide is the recent 4-week average and trend, which have generally hovered near or slightly above 220k, suggesting a mild tilt toward a print exceeding 220k. Weekly noise and routine revisions of 1–5k matter when the threshold is this tight; that pushes me toward a probability near the coin flip but slightly above it given signs of gradual cooling (continuing claims have trended higher over the past year, and hiring has slowed from 2022–2023 peaks). Why not higher: The labor market has remained resilient, and many recent weeks have printed at or below 220k; seasonals in late June can also bias down if auto retooling or school-related layoffs arrive a bit earlier/later than typical and are captured by seasonal factors. Why not lower: The balance of risks leans toward a slight uptick vs. a downtick given gradual cooling and revision risk that could turn a ~220k print into >220k on FRED. What would move me up: The next two releases (for weeks ended Jun 7 and Jun 14) coming in >220k and/or a rise in continuing claims would push me to ~65–70%. What would move me down: Two sub-220k prints before Jun 21, stronger-than-expected employment/hiring data, or evidence that seasonal factors are over-correcting upward in late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 exceed 220,000?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer. The claim requests a determination of basic eligibility for the Unemployment Insurance program.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 is greater than 220,000 according to [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA).&#x20;\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
