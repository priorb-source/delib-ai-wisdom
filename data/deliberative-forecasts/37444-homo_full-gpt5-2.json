    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my assessment: short timeline, strong status quo inertia on SDN listings, public denials by senior officials, EU disinterest, and little practical upside to delisting given NS2’s damage and legal/financial constraints. They also note OFAC can act quickly if ordered, preserving a small tail risk. The main added emphasis is the interagency/allied coordination hurdle within a very short window, which I agree further depresses odds, but it isn’t new evidence beyond what I already considered.",
    "rationale": "Baseline remains “No”: NS2 AG is on the SDN list, and with under two months left, delisting a high-profile Russian energy entity would require clear strategic rationale and political cover that aren’t present. Signals since late April trend against relief: SecState Rubio’s explicit denial, reports of the administration eyeing harsher energy measures (e.g., 500% tariffs), and EU’s lack of interest in reviving NS2. The asset’s partial physical damage and NS2 AG’s legal/financial headwinds further reduce any immediate utility of delisting, diminishing incentives to spend political capital. The residual upside risk is a transactional move tied to a Ukraine deal; the White House could order OFAC to delist quickly as a symbolic concession. However, absent credible, on-record indications of such a package, I keep the probability low. Given that the other analyses don’t introduce new facts but reinforce the same constraints, I see no basis for a change.",
