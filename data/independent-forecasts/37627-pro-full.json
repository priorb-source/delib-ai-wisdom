  "information": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump have had several communications in 2025. On February 12, they spoke for about an hour about peace efforts and cooperation. On March 19, they spoke again, with Zelenskyy expecting to be briefed on Trump's prior conversation with Vladimir Putin. On May 10, following a meeting with European leaders in Kyiv, Zelenskyy spoke with Trump, stating that Ukraine was ready for direct peace talks if a 30-day ceasefire was agreed upon. On the same day, European leaders also held a joint call with Trump from Kyiv.\n\nA proposal was made for direct Russia-Ukraine talks to be held in Istanbul on May 15, 2025. Volodymyr Zelenskyy agreed to attend and invited Donald Trump to be present at the meeting. Trump expressed optimism about the talks and stated he was considering attending, but noted his schedule was busy. His schedule included a trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE from May 12, concluding on May 15, the same day as the proposed meeting.\n\nEuropean powers have demanded a 30-day ceasefire from Russia, starting May 12, warning of new sanctions if the demand was ignored. Donald Trump advised Volodymyr Zelenskyy to accept talks with Vladimir Putin without the precondition of a ceasefire. Conversely, Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine's readiness for talks was contingent on Russia agreeing to a 30-day ceasefire and providing for its effective monitoring.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The resolution window closes on June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The status quo is one of frequent and recent communication between Trump and Zelenskyy. They have spoken by phone three times already in 2025, including as recently as May 10. With high-stakes diplomatic events pending, a continuation of this communication is the most likely course of events.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Donald Trump alters his schedule to attend the proposed May 15 talks in Istanbul in person, where he and Zelenskyy confer directly. This in-person meeting negates the need for a phone call, and no other major event prompts a separate call between them before the June 15 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Logistical constraints from his Middle East trip prevent Donald Trump from attending the May 15 talks in Istanbul. To remain closely involved, he holds a phone call with President Zelenskyy just before the talks to coordinate strategy and another call afterwards for a debriefing on the discussions with Russia.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the established, high-frequency pattern of communication between the two leaders in 2025, as detailed in the research report. They have already spoken in February, March, and on May 10, indicating an open and active line of communication. The upcoming peace talks proposed for May 15 serve as a powerful catalyst for further communication. President Zelenskyy has explicitly invited Trump to be involved, and even if Trump cannot attend in person due to his conflicting travel schedule, his engagement is clearly sought. A phone call represents the most logical and efficient method for him to participate, offer advice, or be briefed on such a critical event. The existing disagreement on the ceasefire precondition is more likely to be a topic of conversation rather than a barrier to it. I have set the probability at 75%, not higher, primarily to account for the possibility that Trump attends the talks in person, which would decrease the likelihood of a separate phone call. A less likely, but possible, scenario is a complete and sudden breakdown of talks and diplomacy. My forecast is not lower because the combination of a strong precedent for calls and a major diplomatic event makes a full month of silence between them improbable. I would increase my forecast if it were confirmed Trump would not attend the talks in person, and I would decrease it if his in-person attendance were confirmed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News: [Key moments that have shaped Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-zelenskyys-relationship-from-perfect-phone-call-to-oval-office-clash-13331892)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump have had several communications in 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
