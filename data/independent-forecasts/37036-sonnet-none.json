    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Dan Osborn has not announced his candidacy; he is currently only exploring a potential run",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Dan Osborn continues his exploratory phase without making a formal announcement by June 1, 2025. He may be waiting to assess fundraising potential, gauge voter sentiment, or coordinate with potential supporters. Alternatively, he could decide not to run at all, or delay his announcement until later in 2025 when closer to traditional campaign filing deadlines for the 2026 midterm election.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Dan Osborn completes his exploration process over the next 5 weeks and makes a formal announcement of his candidacy for US Senate before June 1, 2025. The early April exploration phase suggests he's seriously considering the race, and he decides to announce early to build momentum, lock in early donors, and begin campaigning against incumbent Pete Ricketts.",
    "rationale": "The key evidence is the April 3, 2025 Nebraska Examiner article indicating Osborn is 'exploring' a Senate bid. This occurred 20 days ago, and we have 38 days remaining until the deadline. The status quo strongly favors 'No' - no announcement has been made yet, and good forecasters should weight this heavily as the world changes slowly. However, several factors provide upside: (1) actively exploring is a significant signal of intent - politicians don't publicly explore races they're not seriously considering, (2) there's still substantial time (5+ weeks) for an announcement, and (3) the story received media attention, suggesting real momentum. Factors limiting the probability: (1) the lack of any additional information suggesting imminent announcement, (2) many exploration phases last months, not weeks, (3) for a 2026 midterm election, there's no urgency to announce in early 2025, and (4) 'exploring' is specifically not announcing - it's a deliberative phase. The probability is not higher because we have no concrete signals of an imminent announcement and the status quo (no announcement) should carry significant weight. It's not lower because the active exploration phase represents meaningful progress toward candidacy, distinguishing this from a baseline scenario where no one is considering a run.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Dan Osborn announce his candidacy for US Senator from Nebraska before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNebraska Examiner: [Nebraska’s Dan Osborn exploring midterm bid against U.S. Sen Pete Ricketts](https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/04/03/nebraskas-dan-osborn-exploring-midterm-bid-against-u-s-sen-pete-ricketts/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Dan Osborn announces his candidacy for US Senator from Nebraska before June 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
