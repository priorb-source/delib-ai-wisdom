    "review": "Both peers largely echo the same macro picture I used: three straight negative CPI prints, deep and persistent PPI deflation, weak PMIs, struggling property, soft core. New or helpful additions: Forecaster 3 explicitly notes potential (favorable) base effects from May 2024 that could push YoY higher, which argues against deflation; Forecaster 2/3 both stress the breadth and persistence of weakness as reason to lean Yes. Neither addresses the razor-thin margin around zero and the risk that FRED’s displayed value rounds to 0.0, which is material for resolution. They also implicitly treat PPI as a strong driver of headline CPI at the margin; I view that linkage as real but noisy, especially when the headline is hovering near zero and food/energy swings dominate.",
    "rationale": "My prior take remains: the balance of evidence tilts slightly toward another negative YoY print, but it’s very close to zero. Reinforcements since my initial view: contemporaneous May weakness (manufacturing PMI 49.5; developers’ sales still falling) and indications that domestic energy and pork stayed negative YoY reduce the odds of a positive headline. Offsetting risks remain: May Day services strength, modest YoY oil rise, and possible low base in May 2024 that could lift the YoY. Given peers’ emphasis on persistent deflationary pressure and the weak May activity data, I nudge up slightly, but I keep the forecast near coin-flip due to the rounding/display risk at FRED and the small magnitude needed to flip to 0.0/+0.1.",
