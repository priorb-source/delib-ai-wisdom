  "information": "According to a March 25, 2025 report, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) denied reports of plans to suspend Starlink's satellite broadband service. The TRCSL Director General stated that a 'dashboard system' is required to regulate the service and that its implementation had been delayed. The Director General mentioned that the service was expected to become operational in April 2025 once the necessary systems were in place.\n\nA separate report from March 23, 2025, stated that the Sri Lankan government had put Starlink services on hold until the company guarantees government agencies the right to intercept data or communication details for national security reasons. According to the Deputy Minister of Information Technology, discussions between the Defence Ministry, TRCSL, and Starlink were still at a preliminary stage. The report also noted that the TRCSL had already approved tariff plans for Starlink services.\n\nReports from late April and early May 2025 provide context on Starlink's expansion in the region. Bangladesh's telecommunication regulator granted Starlink two 10-year operating licenses, making it the second South Asian country after Sri Lanka to approve the service. Officials indicated that Starlink was preparing to launch service in Bangladesh by May 2025. In contrast, Starlink's full license in Pakistan is delayed pending permanent registration and the clearance of technical and security checks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (45 days from May 16, 2025, to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Starlink's service in Sri Lanka is currently on hold pending regulatory and security approvals, and its website does not show availability.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discussions between Starlink and the Sri Lankan Defence Ministry regarding national security and data access protocols do not reach a conclusion by the deadline. Concurrently, the implementation of the regulatory 'dashboard system' by the TRCSL continues to be delayed, preventing the service from launching and the availability map from being updated before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "High-level political pressure accelerates the negotiations, leading to a swift agreement between Starlink and the Sri Lankan government on security protocols in late May or June 2025. The TRCSL concurrently completes its regulatory system implementation, giving Starlink the final go-ahead to officially launch the service and update its map to 'Available' before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is based primarily on the significant bureaucratic and security-related hurdles that remain unresolved despite the initial license grant in August 2024. As of late March 2025, crucial discussions between Starlink and Sri Lanka's Defence Ministry over data interception were described as being at a 'preliminary stage.' Such negotiations involving national security are typically complex and lengthy. Furthermore, a projected April 2025 launch date was missed due to delays in implementing a required regulatory 'dashboard system,' which is a strong indicator that timelines are slipping. With a deadline of July 1, 2025, there are only about six weeks left to resolve these fundamental issues. While Starlink's recent licensing in Bangladesh shows regional progress, the prolonged delays in Pakistan over similar security concerns highlight how these issues can stall a launch. The status quo is one of inaction and delay, and overcoming this inertia in a short period is improbable. The forecast is not lower than 25% because there is clear political will from some parts of the government to launch the service, which could lead to a sudden breakthrough. The forecast is not higher because the 'preliminary' stage of security talks as of late March and a major missed deadline are strong evidence pointing to further delays. I would raise my probability upon credible reports of a finalized agreement with the Defence Ministry. I would lower it if reports indicated a stalemate in negotiations.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
