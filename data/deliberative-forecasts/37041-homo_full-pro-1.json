    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of this question: the most likely outcome is 'No' due to the very short five-week timeline, the power of the status quo, and the robust preventative measures already in place in at-risk countries, particularly Panama. Forecaster 2's specific mention of the Darién Gap as a geographical barrier reinforced this view. The most compelling new argument came from Forecaster 3, who broke down the full causal chain required for a 'Yes' outcome: cross-border transmission, human infection, detection, official reporting, and finally, the issuance of a CDC advisory. This framing effectively highlights the number of consecutive, time-consuming steps that must all be completed before June 1. This argument was highly convincing and made me reconsider the probability of this entire sequence occurring so quickly.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am lowering my probability from 8% to 6%. My initial reasoning remains intact: the status quo is strongly favored due to the short timeframe and significant public health buffers in Panama and Costa Rica. However, the deliberation highlighted that I may have underestimated the logistical friction involved in the outcome. Forecaster 3's analysis of the multi-step causal chain—from viral transmission to a formal CDC advisory—was particularly persuasive. The probability of each step in that chain being completed successfully within five weeks makes the overall likelihood lower than I first estimated. I am revising my forecast downward to 6% to reflect this more granular understanding of the hurdles. I am not moving lower, to 5%, because I maintain that the unprecedented severity of the outbreak in neighboring Colombia creates extreme 'viral pressure' and a state of high alert. This could lead to an abnormally rapid detection and CDC response should even a single confirmed case of local transmission occur, slightly elevating the risk above what a purely procedural analysis might suggest.",
