  "information": "Han Duck-soo is required by law to resign from his post as acting president by May 4, 2025, to be eligible for the presidential election. He has already missed the April 15 deadline to register for the People Power Party (PPP) primary. Consequently, PPP leadership has publicly stated he will not be included in their primary process. South Korean constitutional norms and historical precedent discourage caretaker heads of state from running for office.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "13 days (until May 5, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han continues as caretaker/acting president, does not resign by May 4, and explicitly declines to enter the race; PPP proceeds with other candidates and the window closes without any announcement from Han.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Amid mounting PPP pressure to ‘draft’ him, Han announces his presidential bid before May 5 and tenders his resignation by May 4 to meet eligibility rules; alternatively, he announces an independent bid to be formalized later.",
    "rationale": "Baseline inertia favors no announcement: there are only ~13 days left, and acting heads of state in Korea have historically refrained from running (e.g., 2017 precedent). The research assistant notes three meaningful constraints: (1) he must resign by May 4 to be eligible, which imposes a high personal and institutional cost; (2) he missed the April 15 PPP primary registration, and PPP leadership has said he won’t be included; (3) constitutional norms discourage caretaker candidacies. Han’s technocratic profile and age further reduce the likelihood that he abruptly pivots into a national campaign. Countervailing signals exist: reporting that PPP support is growing to draft him indicates a nonzero chance of a late, political ‘break glass’ move, and the question requires only an announcement (not formal nomination), which lowers the bar. That said, party rule-bending and a resignation within days are heavy lifts, and party leaders have publicly signaled against including him in the primary. Why not higher: institutional/party hurdles, tight timeline, caretaker norm, and his profile all weigh against a run. Why not lower: credible media chatter about drafting him and the possibility he announces first and sorts mechanics later keep a tail risk alive. Upward updates: reports of Han forming an exploratory committee, scheduling a campaign-style event, coordinating a resignation, or PPP initiating an emergency rule waiver/‘draft’ process. Downward updates: a clear public statement by Han ruling out a run, PPP locking in another nominee, or legal/NEC guidance that forecloses a timely candidacy.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Han Duck-soo announce his candidacy for South Korean president before May 5, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Chosun Daily: [Support grows in PPP to draft Acting President Han for June election](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464554)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Han Duck-soo announces his candidacy for president of South Korea before May 5, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHan Duck-soo is required by law to resign from his post as acting president by May 4, 2025, to be eligible for the presidential election. He has already missed the April 15 deadline to register for the People Power Party (PPP) primary. Consequently, PPP leadership has publicly stated he will not be included in their primary process. South Korean constitutional norms and historical precedent discourage caretaker heads of state from running for office.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
