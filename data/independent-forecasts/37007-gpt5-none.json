    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1–2 weeks (election on Apr 28; preliminary seat counts likely within 24–72 hours afterward).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the incumbent PNM remains the largest party by a narrow margin.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The UNC flips several marginal constituencies in Trinidad and at least one of the two Tobago seats shifts away from PNM (or stays non-PNM), with anti-incumbent sentiment on crime/economy boosting turnout in UNC strongholds. Result: UNC ends with the most seats (e.g., 21–22) while PNM drops below.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "PNM defends most of its 2020 marginals, limits UNC gains in the East–West Corridor and central marginals, and either holds at least one Tobago seat or offsets Tobago losses with a pickup in a close Trinidad seat. Result: PNM edges UNC on seats (e.g., 21–22 for PNM).",
    "rationale": "- Base rates and status quo: In Trinidad and Tobago, general elections are usually two-party contests with narrow seat margins. The PNM won in 2015 and 2020 (22–19 in 2020), so the status quo is PNM as the largest party. Incumbency and the government’s decision to call an early election suggest they see a viable path to remaining first in seats. That nudges the prior slightly toward a PNM plurality.\n- Countervailing factors: Public concern about crime and economic pressures could fuel anti-incumbent voting. Local government results in 2023 were essentially even, implying a competitive national landscape rather than a clear PNM advantage. Tobago is a specific risk: PNM dominance there weakened in subsequent THA elections, and if one or both Tobago seats are lost, PNM must compensate in tight Trinidad marginals to retain a plurality.\n- Polling/data quality: High-quality, seat-level polling is sparse, which increases reliance on fundamentals (incumbency, recent margins, partisan geography). Those fundamentals point to a close race. The lack of strong pro-UNC national polling prevents a big move away from the status quo; conversely, visible erosion of PNM support in Tobago and urban marginals prevents a confident pro-PNM call.\n- Why not higher: Narrow 2020 majority, potential Tobago losses, and salience of crime/economy keep downside risks meaningful for PNM.\n- Why not lower: Incumbency, early-election timing, and historically stable partisan blocs (ethnic/regional bases) still give PNM a plausible path to the most seats.\n- What would move me up: Credible constituency polling showing PNM holding key marginals; signs of PNM recovery/alliances in Tobago; strong early-vote/ground-game indicators for PNM.\n- What would move me down: Evidence of UNC leading in multiple swing seats; confirmed fragmentation of PNM vote in Tobago with a non-PNM sweep; late-breaking scandals or turnout signals favoring UNC.\n- Research assistant: No additional info provided; forecast relies on historical context, known 2020 results, recent local electoral balance, and structural factors.",
