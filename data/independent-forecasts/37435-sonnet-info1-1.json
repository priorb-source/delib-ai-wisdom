  "information": "Chegg Inc. received a non-compliance notice from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) because its stock price fell below the minimum average closing price of $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, trading around $0.51-$0.65 as of early May 2025. The company has a six-month period to regain compliance, with potential measures including a reverse stock split. Chegg is scheduled to release its Q1 2025 financial results on May 12, 2025. Analyst predictions for the quarter include earnings of $0.01 per share and revenue of $114.77 million.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 57 days (from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No bankruptcy filing - Chegg continues operating despite financial difficulties",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Chegg releases Q1 2025 results on May 12 that show continued operations with modest revenue ($114.77M projected). While the business faces challenges from AI competition and stock price issues, the company maintains sufficient liquidity to continue operations. Management pursues alternatives like cost cutting, reverse stock split for NYSE compliance, or seeking additional financing rather than bankruptcy protection.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Q1 2025 results reveal a severe cash flow crisis, debt covenant violations, or inability to meet near-term financial obligations. Creditors demand immediate action, and management determines that Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection is necessary to restructure debt and continue operations. The filing occurs between mid-May and end of June 2025.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors no bankruptcy filing in this timeframe. While Chegg faces serious financial distress - evidenced by the stock trading at $0.51-$0.65 and NYSE non-compliance - there are no current indicators of an immediate liquidity crisis that would necessitate bankruptcy protection within 57 days. The research assistant reports expected Q1 earnings of $0.01 per share on revenue of $114.77M, suggesting the company remains operationally viable, albeit struggling. Key considerations: (1) Timeframe is very short - bankruptcy filings typically follow months of deterioration and exhausted alternatives; (2) NYSE non-compliance has a 6-month cure period, suggesting some runway exists; (3) Companies facing business model disruption usually attempt multiple restructuring options before bankruptcy; (4) No reported debt covenant violations or creditor actions. The upcoming Q1 results on May 12 are critical - catastrophic results could accelerate a crisis, but even then, management would likely pursue emergency financing or other measures before filing. Why not lower (2-3%)? The AI disruption is fundamental and the stock collapse is severe - there's genuine risk the situation is worse than publicly known. Why not higher (15-20%)? Bankruptcy is a decision of last resort requiring acute crisis, and we lack evidence of imminent collapse. For me to update significantly higher, I'd need Q1 results showing critical cash shortfalls, debt defaults, or creditor demands. To update lower, I'd need evidence of stabilization, new financing, or adequate cash reserves.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Chegg, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nChegg Inc. received a non-compliance notice from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) because its stock price fell below the minimum average closing price of $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, trading around $0.51-$0.65 as of early May 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
