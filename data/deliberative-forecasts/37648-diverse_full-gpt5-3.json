    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds heavy weight to the Israeli media report as a high‑confidence signal and to deadline pressure. Forecaster 3 largely echoes my concerns about structural incompatibilities and compressed timing. I agree that repeated rounds, converging rhetoric, and a self‑imposed deadline increase odds above a purely base‑rate view. But I’m not persuaded that the Israeli report alone warrants a >50% call: such leaks can be messaging or pressure tactics, and Israel’s incentives are not perfectly aligned with an early US–Iran deal. The core gulf—US “red lines” (removal of all enriched uranium, dismantlement, no sunsets) vs. Iran’s insistence on maintaining a civilian program—remains the binding constraint. I find Forecaster 3’s caution more convincing than Forecaster 2’s optimism, though F2 fairly notes that even an interim or framework could meet the question’s bar.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining (~46 days) is short for finalizing and announcing even a framework that both sides can sell domestically, given stated maximalist positions and ongoing US sanctions additions. Still, multiple rounds, Oman’s facilitation, E3 engagement, language about “convergence,” and Iran’s willingness to eliminate 60% stock and cap at civilian levels under tighter oversight keep a non‑trivial path open—particularly for a narrowly scoped interim that freezes enrichment above a low threshold, ships out 60% stock, and trades limited sanctions relief. I downgrade the evidentiary weight of the Israeli media “high chance” report because it could reflect political signaling rather than firm intel on an imminent text. Overall, I stick close to my prior but nudge up slightly to reflect sustained process momentum and the possibility that an “agreement in principle” or interim freeze would satisfy the resolution criteria, even if it falls short of the US’s public red lines.",
