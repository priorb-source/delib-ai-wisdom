  "information": "As of May 2025, 147 out of 193 UN member states officially recognize the State of Palestine, while 46 members do not. The non-recognizing states include most Western European nations, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea. In 2024, five countries newly recognized Palestine: Norway, Ireland, Spain, Slovenia, and Armenia. The Israeli government strongly opposes the international recognition effort. An Israeli official stated the country \"will not cooperate\" with such measures and warned of potential further annexation of the West Bank. The United States and several other G7 members also continue to withhold official recognition.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month. The resolution period is June 1, 2025, to June 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. No UN member country that does not already recognize Palestine announces its recognition during June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing discussions and initiatives within Europe, diplomatic inertia and strong opposition from Israel and the United States persuade potential recognizing countries to postpone their decision. The one-month window of June passes without a formal announcement from any of the 46 non-recognizing states.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Building on the momentum from the 2024 recognitions by several European nations and spurred by the UK-backed French initiative mentioned in news reports, a UN member country, likely a European one such as Belgium, Malta, or France itself, formally announces its recognition of Palestine to increase pressure for a two-state solution.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant but uncertain momentum toward Palestinian recognition among Western nations. The research shows a clear trend, with five countries recognizing Palestine in 2024, breaking a long-standing stalemate among Western-aligned nations. The key new information is the report of the UK joining a French initiative, which signals that high-level diplomatic efforts are underway among major G7 powers who have not yet recognized Palestine. This significantly increases the likelihood of a near-term recognition compared to the historical baseline. However, the status quo still represents a powerful force. Diplomatic decisions of this magnitude are subject to intense internal debate and external pressure, especially from powerful allies like the United States and from Israel, which has threatened countermeasures. A one-month window is very specific and narrow, and such diplomatic initiatives can often take longer than a month to come to fruition, or they may be timed to coincide with larger international meetings or events outside of June. My probability is not higher than 35% because the forces of inertia and direct opposition from the US and Israel are substantial, and the timeline is very short for such a momentous decision to be finalized and announced. My probability is not lower because the wave of recognitions in 2024 demonstrates that the previous dam of Western non-recognition has broken, and the specific mention of a France-UK initiative suggests that concrete action is being planned, making a June announcement plausible. I would increase my forecast if there were specific statements from officials in France, the UK, Belgium, or another potential recognizer indicating an announcement was imminent or planned for June. I would decrease my forecast if these same officials explicitly stated a decision was not forthcoming in June or reaffirmed that recognition could only happen after a negotiated settlement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a UN member country newly recognize Palestine in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[UK joins France's initiative for recognition of Palestinian state](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/05/20/uk-joins-france-s-initiative-for-recognition-of-palestinian-state_6741456_4.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, a UN member country announces that it recognizes Palestine as a sovereign nation. Resolves based on Al Jazeera's [tracking page](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/10/mapping-which-countries-recognise-palestine-in-2025) or other credible sources should the tracking page not be timely updated.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of May 2025, 147 out of 193 UN member states officially recognize the State of Palestine, while 46 members do not. The non-recognizing states include most Western European nations, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
