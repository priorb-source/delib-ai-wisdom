    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis closely mirrors my own reasoning, arriving at 15% versus my 12%. The main difference is their slightly greater emphasis on the health crisis scenario - specifically noting that pancreatic necrosis could cause sudden death or incapacitation even within 20 days. This is a fair point I may have underweighted.\n\nForecaster 3 at 24% presents the highest forecast but I find their reasoning less compelling. They frame this as a 'managed transition being contemplated,' which seems to give too much weight to the May 6 statement itself. However, Kadyrov has made similar statements three times before without consequence. More critically, they note that 'typical practice would be telegraphed shortly after' the May 7 meeting if a transition were imminent - yet we're now 5 days past that meeting with zero concrete signals. This absence of follow-through is significant evidence AGAINST transition.\n\nForecaster 3 also makes an important point that actually supports a lower forecast: Adam Kadyrov is only 17, making him too young for immediate formal succession. This structural constraint argues against any imminent transition, not for it.\n\nThe most important evidence both forecasters and I agree on: Putin gave 'full understanding and support' (not acceptance of resignation), and by May 12 Kadyrov was downplaying resignation rumors. The historical base rate of three false alarms remains decisive.",
    "rationale": "On reflection, I think my initial forecast slightly underweighted the health emergency scenario. Multiple credible sources report pancreatic necrosis and kidney problems, and Forecaster 2 correctly notes such conditions can cause sudden incapacitation within short timeframes. This non-trivial medical risk justifies a small upward adjustment.\n\nHowever, the evidence against imminent transition remains overwhelming: (1) We're now 5 days past the Putin meeting with no concrete transition steps - if this were imminent, we'd expect rapid movement; (2) Kadyrov's May 12 statements actively downplayed resignation; (3) Adam's age (17) creates structural barriers to immediate succession; (4) Putin explicitly gave support rather than accepting resignation; (5) Three previous identical episodes (2016, 2020, 2022) all proved to be political theater.\n\nThe key insight from the deliberation is that both the May 12 downplaying and the absence of any transition choreography in the 5 days since the Putin meeting are strong negative signals that Forecaster 3's higher forecast doesn't adequately account for. I'll update slightly upward to better reflect health emergency risk, but the fundamentals strongly favor status quo persistence.",
