    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully emphasizes momentum after sharp drops and the risk that the drivers (inflation expectations, tariff headlines, rates) don’t resolve quickly. That’s a good caution against assuming an automatic bounce. However, setting the Yes probability at 35% seems too low given the low threshold (60.0) and the absence, so far, of a clear macro shock of the magnitude typically associated with sustained sub-60 readings. Forecaster 3’s base-rate point—that sub-60 has historically been rare and associated with crises—is directionally right, though it’s a bit overstated since we did see multiple sub-60 months in 2022. Still, in today’s backdrop, a break below 60 likely needs another sizable negative surprise (e.g., a hot CPI print combined with risk-off markets). Overall, I find F2’s persistence/momentum risk worth incorporating, and F3’s base-rate argument supports keeping the probability above even odds.",
    "rationale": "My initial read leaned on the idea that the May plunge still left the level above 60, so breaching ≤60 in June would require another notably weak month, which is possible but not the base case absent a new shock. After considering F2’s momentum argument and the upcoming catalysts (May CPI on 6/12, FOMC communications), I see a bit more downside tail risk than I initially reflected—especially because inflation expectations can swing the Michigan index. At the same time, F3’s historical framing and the low 60 threshold argue against making a sub-60 the base case. Net, I’m trimming my forecast modestly to reflect the risk of a second leg down but still view >60 as more likely than not. I would move higher on a benign CPI print and stable markets; lower on a hot CPI with a hawkish Fed tone and rising gas prices or a weak June prelim reading.",
