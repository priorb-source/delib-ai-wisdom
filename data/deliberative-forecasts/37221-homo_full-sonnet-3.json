    "review": "All three forecasters have independently arrived at remarkably similar conclusions (23%, 23%, 25%) using essentially identical reasoning. This strong convergence is notable and provides validation that our probability range is well-calibrated. Each analysis correctly identifies: (1) the clear downward trend from 2.3% to 2.2%, (2) the consensus forecast of 2.1% below the threshold, (3) the multiple structural disinflationary factors (ECB rate cuts, weak PMI, wage deceleration, energy deflation), and (4) the appropriate sources of uncertainty (proximity to threshold, forecast error ranges, services inflation persistence). Neither forecaster raised any evidence, arguments, or alternative scenarios that I hadn't already considered in my initial analysis. The absence of any contrarian viewpoint or overlooked factor, combined with our independent convergence on the same probability range, suggests the available evidence is unambiguous and being interpreted correctly. This is a case where the data clearly points in one direction, and the only genuine uncertainty relates to normal forecast error and volatility around a threshold that was exactly hit in March.",
    "rationale": "The strong convergence of independent forecasts reinforces rather than undermines my initial analysis. When multiple forecasters with the same information reach the same conclusion through the same reasoning, it typically indicates the probability is well-calibrated rather than suggesting a need to update. The evidence remains: March inflation was exactly at 2.2%, the consensus for April is 2.1%, and all structural factors support continued disinflation. The 23-25% range appropriately captures the uncertainty from being so close to the threshold combined with typical forecast errors of 0.1-0.2 percentage points. No new information or alternative perspectives were presented that would warrant adjusting my forecast. The convergence actually increases my confidence that 23% appropriately reflects the available evidence.",
