  "information": "According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Inegi), Mexico's unemployment rate reached a historic low of 2.2% in March 2025. This was a decrease from 2.3% in March 2024 and 2.5% in February 2025. The total number of unemployed individuals was 1.4 million. The economically active population (PEA) was reported at 61.1 million, with a participation rate of 59.3%. In contrast, the informal labor sector accounted for 54.4% of the workforce, and the number of underemployed individuals—those needing to work more hours—rose to 3.9 million, representing 6.6% of the employed population.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects a 0.3% economic contraction for Mexico in 2025, citing the effects of tariffs imposed by the United States on key Mexican products. The IMF also predicts Mexico's unemployment rate will increase from 2.8% to 3.8% during 2025. Separately, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) forecasts Mexico's economy will grow by 1.3% in 2025 and 0.6% in 2026, though these projections are conditional on the tariff situation. The U.S. has imposed tariffs of 25% on key Mexican products like autos, steel, and plastics.\n\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has publicly rejected the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) prediction of a 0.3% economic contraction in Mexico for 2025. She stated that the economic models of the Ministry of Finance contradict the IMF's projection and that the government has a strategic plan, known as 'Plan México', to reactivate and strengthen the national economy. As part of this strategy, the president has called on commercial banks to reduce interest rates to promote economic growth.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. Today is April 29, 2025, and the question concerns April 2025 unemployment data. Mexico's statistical agency (Inegi) typically releases monthly unemployment data within 3-4 weeks after the month ends, so we should know the outcome by mid-May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Mexico's unemployment rate was 2.2% in March 2025, representing a historic low and well below the 3% threshold. The recent trend has been declining (2.5% in February 2025, 2.3% in March 2024, 2.2% in March 2025). If this trajectory continues or stabilizes, April 2025 would remain under 3%.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The unemployment rate jumps from 2.2% in March 2025 to 3.0% or higher in April 2025—an increase of at least 0.8 percentage points in a single month. This would require immediate, severe job losses from US tariffs on autos, steel, and plastics causing rapid shutdowns or layoffs in affected sectors, or an unexpected economic shock causing widespread unemployment before April ended.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The unemployment rate remains below 3% in April 2025, staying near the March level of 2.2% or rising modestly to perhaps 2.4-2.9%. The tariff impacts take time to materialize in employment data, government interventions under Plan México provide some buffer, and the labor market maintains its resilience through April despite growing economic headwinds.",
    "rationale": "The most critical factor is that April 2025 has already ended (today is April 29), so whatever unemployment level exists has already been determined—we're just awaiting the official data release. Starting from March's historic low of 2.2%, the rate would need to increase by at least 0.8 percentage points in a single month to reach the 3.0% threshold. Monthly unemployment changes of this magnitude are extremely rare outside of major economic crises. While the US tariffs (25% on key Mexican exports) represent a significant threat, employment impacts from trade policy typically materialize over months, not weeks. The IMF projects unemployment rising from 2.8% to 3.8% during 2025, but this is a full-year forecast—April represents just the fourth month of the year, very early in that trajectory. The 0.8-point cushion below 3% provides substantial buffer. Normal monthly volatility rarely exceeds 0.1-0.2 percentage points. Even if tariffs began causing job losses in April, the full impact would take time to process through layoffs, job searches, and statistical reporting. The Mexican government's Plan México and efforts to stabilize the economy may also provide some near-term support. However, I'm not assigning an even higher probability because: (1) there are real economic headwinds from tariffs, (2) the IMF's projection indicates serious deterioration ahead, and (3) some immediate impact from trade disruption could theoretically appear in April data. For me to revise downward, I would need evidence of massive April layoffs or plant closures that occurred but haven't been widely reported. To revise upward, I would need confirmation that April economic activity remained stable.",
