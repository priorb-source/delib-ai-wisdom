  "information": "Greenland's economy is substantially dependent on an annual block grant from Denmark, which amounts to approximately 4.3 billion Danish kroner and makes up about half of the government's budget. The current government's stated priority is to develop Greenland's mineral resources to build economic self-sufficiency before moving toward political independence. The 2009 Self-Government Act provides the legal basis for Greenland to declare independence through a referendum. Past referendums, such as those in 1979 and 2008, had significantly longer preparation and lead times than the period before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "After the March 2025 election, a coalition led by independence gradualists focuses on economic development and the stalled constitution process. With limited legislative time before the summer, no bill or decree setting an independence referendum date is brought forward, and leaders explicitly signal that independence will wait until greater self-sufficiency. The deadline passes without an official date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In coalition talks, a more hardline pro-independence partner secures a pledge to set a referendum date (possibly years in the future). The new premier or the Inatsisartut formally announces a specific date in June, framing it as a long-term commitment irrespective of readiness, which counts as “officially scheduled.”",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: Greenland’s major parties are pro-independence in principle but the governing faction is gradualist. Reuters’ framing that “independence gradualists win” implies low appetite for rushing to schedule an independence vote immediately after the election.\n- Capacity and timing: Only ~2 months remain. Forming a coalition, setting a governing program, and moving any enabling act or formal announcement through the proper authorities typically takes longer. Past Greenland referendums (1979 home rule; 2008 self-rule) had substantial lead times and consensus-building.\n- Incentives: The research assistant notes Greenland relies on a ~4.3bn DKK annual block grant, ~half the budget. Current leaders emphasize building economic self-sufficiency via mineral development before independence. That priority reduces the incentive to lock in a date soon, as doing so could constrain negotiations and raise fiscal uncertainty.\n- What could push to Yes: A coalition deal with a more hardline pro-independence party (e.g., a demand to codify a referendum date—potentially distant, such as 2027–2030) and a political calculus that an announcement is symbolically valuable yet low-cost now. The question counts any official scheduling by an authorized Greenlandic authority, regardless of Danish reaction or how far in the future the date is.\n- Why not higher: The new government’s gradualist mandate, fiscal dependence, and short time window all point to inertia. There’s no strong evidence of pre-existing legislative groundwork for an independence referendum this spring, and the constitution-drafting process (distinct from an independence vote) has recently been contentious and delayed.\n- Why not lower: Greenlandic politics are broadly pro-independence, and a future-dated referendum announcement could be used as a symbolic coalition compromise without committing to immediate separation. That keeps a small, nonzero chance alive.\n- Update signals upward: Coalition agreement text or credible reporting committing to a referendum date; a government communiqué placing a referendum bill on the near-term legislative calendar; a prime ministerial statement promising to announce a specific date before summer.\n- Update signals downward: Government leaders explicitly rule out setting any independence referendum date this term or until after a constitution referendum; legislative calendar shows no room for such a measure before July; coalition includes parties opposed to scheduling a date now.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nGreenland's economy is substantially dependent on an annual block grant from Denmark, which amounts to approximately 4.3 billion Danish kroner and makes up about half of the government's budget.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
