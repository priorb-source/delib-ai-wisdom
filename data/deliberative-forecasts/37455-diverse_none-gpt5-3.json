    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully emphasizes that the license is the dominant hurdle and that Starlink can activate quickly, possibly leveraging nearby infrastructure and ISLs. However, 85% seems too high given the short window and the absence of any visible launch signals (order page acceptance, Q2 tag on the map, local partner/logistics news). Starlink rollouts after licensing have shown wide variance, and minor administrative steps (type approval, import, payments) can easily push past 6–8 weeks. Forecaster 3’s overall caution aligns with my prior view, though their claim that South Africa already has Starlink service is incorrect; South Africa is not officially available, which weakens their argument about regional readiness. Net, F2 adds a valid point on operational capability and incentives, but not enough to outweigh the lack of current indicators; F3’s framework is sound aside from the SA error.",
    "rationale": "Lesotho’s license (Apr 14) removes the main regulatory barrier, and with ISL, in-country gateways are not a blocker. That supports a meaningful chance of a June flip. Offsetting this are (a) only ~55 days left, (b) no evidence yet of type approval/shipping/order-page enablement or a Q2 label on the availability map, and (c) the need to manage geofencing/political optics given Lesotho’s enclave within South Africa (not yet officially available). Historically, post-license activation timelines span weeks to a few months; with time tight and no preparatory signals visible, the base remains moderate. I would move up quickly on any signals like the map showing Q2 for Lesotho or order flow opening; I’d move down on signs of additional regulatory/type-approval steps or import/payment hurdles. Given deliberation inputs, I maintain my estimate.",
