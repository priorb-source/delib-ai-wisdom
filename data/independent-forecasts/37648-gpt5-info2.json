  "information": "The U.S. administration has outlined 14 non-negotiable 'red lines' for any new nuclear deal with Iran. These conditions include the complete removal of all of Iran's enriched uranium, the dismantling of its centrifuges, and the absence of any 'sunset clauses' that would allow restrictions to expire. President Trump has stated he is open to a deal to make the region safer, but his administration has also recently imposed new sanctions on Iran. Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the introduction of new sanctions during negotiations 'unacceptable.' Vice President J.D. Vance has publicly stated that Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon is 'completely off the table.' The U.S. negotiating position emphasizes the need for a 'strong agreement' with robust verification measures.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 47 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announced or signed US–Iran nuclear agreement; continued indirect contacts and pressure, but nothing public that meets the criterion.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Talks remain exploratory or stall over US ‘red lines’ (uranium removal, centrifuge dismantlement, no sunsets) that Tehran won’t accept. Washington adds or maintains sanctions; any de-escalatory understandings stay informal and unannounced to avoid domestic and legal costs, so the question resolves No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A narrowly scoped, publicly acknowledged interim understanding is reached and announced (possibly via a joint statement) where Iran caps/rolls back enrichment and expands IAEA access in exchange for limited, reversible sanctions relief or waivers—marketed as a temporary confidence-building measure or ‘framework’ mediated by Oman/Qatar.",
    "rationale": "Baseline/priors and time: With only ~6–7 weeks left, complex international agreements—especially on nuclear constraints and verification—are rarely concluded and announced on such short notice unless they are very limited. The default is no deal announced.\nConstraints: According to the research assistant, the current US administration has articulated stringent ‘red lines’ (e.g., complete removal of enriched uranium, dismantling centrifuges, no sunset clauses) and has recently imposed new sanctions, while Iran has called sanctions during talks unacceptable. VP Vance has said an Iranian nuclear weapon is off the table, signaling a hard line. These positions imply very little overlap with what Tehran would accept, especially on core issues like stockpile removal and permanent constraints. A public announcement that deviates from those red lines would carry political and legal costs in Washington (e.g., potential INARA review), which further reduces the chance of a speedy, public deal.\nTrack record: Past breakthroughs (e.g., 2013 JPOA, 2015 JCPOA) took months of intensive diplomacy and were preceded by visible signals (IAEA access deals, minister-level meetings, synchronized confidence-building). In recent years, when understandings have occurred, they’ve often been informal and unannounced—insufficient for this question’s criterion.\nOn the Israeli media claim of a ‘high chance’: Such reports sometimes reflect signaling or leverage in ongoing regional dynamics. Absent corroborating signs like scheduled high-level meetings, coordinated sanctions waivers, or IAEA-facilitated joint statements, I discount it significantly.\nWhy not higher: The combination of maximalist US demands, Tehran’s likely red lines, short runway, and the requirement for a public announcement makes a near-term deal unlikely.\nWhy not lower: There remains a non-zero chance of a limited, interim, publicly acknowledged arrangement (a freeze-for-freeze with verification) that both sides can portray as temporary and consistent with their narratives. Mediation channels (Oman/Qatar) exist, and Iran’s economic incentives could support a modest, reversible step if framed carefully.\nWhat would move me up: Clear signals of imminent diplomacy (e.g., White House readouts about nuclear talks; IAEA Director General travel producing a joint communiqué; concurrent US sanctions waivers or general licenses; Iranian steps like pausing 60% enrichment; reports of an agreed verification modality; scheduling of a ministerial signing/announcement).\nWhat would move me down: New US/EU sanctions designations tied to nuclear activities; IAEA censure without remedial steps; Iranian escalation (higher enrichment, reduced monitoring); major regional flare-ups; domestic statements ruling out interim agreements.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States and Iran announce a new nuclear deal before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nIsraeli media (Hebrew): [Senior ministers were informed: There is a high chance that the US and Iran will reach an agreement](https://www.kan.org.il/content/kan-news/politic/895178/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the US and Iran sign or announce an agreement with respect to Iran's nuclear program.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. administration has outlined 14 non-negotiable 'red lines' for any new nuclear deal with Iran.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
