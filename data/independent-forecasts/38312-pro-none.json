    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The summit is scheduled for June 2025, and the outcome will be known once the summit takes place or the final attendee list is confirmed.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. While India has been a regular outreach partner at G7 summits, the severe and ongoing diplomatic tensions with the 2025 host nation, Canada, combined with the reported lack of an invitation so close to the event, makes non-attendance the most likely outcome if current conditions persist.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Due to the unresolved diplomatic conflict over the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, the Canadian government, as the G7 host, decides against inviting Prime Minister Modi to the summit. The absence of an invitation means PM Modi does not attend.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Recognizing India's crucial role as a global economic power and strategic partner in the Indo-Pacific, other G7 members, particularly the United States, successfully pressure Canada to extend a last-minute invitation. Both India and Canada agree to compartmentalize the bilateral issue, and Prime Minister Modi attends the summit.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily weights the acute diplomatic crisis between India and the host nation, Canada. The host has the prerogative to set the guest list for outreach sessions. The provided information that other non-G7 nations have been invited while India has not, just weeks before the summit, is a very strong indicator that an invitation is not forthcoming. This specific circumstance outweighs the recent historical precedent of India's attendance. The status quo is no longer 'India attends G7'; it is 'India is in a major diplomatic dispute with the G7 host'.\n\nMy probability is not lower because India's geostrategic importance is undeniable, and there is a non-trivial possibility that other G7 members could exert significant pressure on Canada to secure India's presence for key discussions, leading to a late invitation. A back-channel diplomatic resolution, however unlikely it appears now, cannot be entirely ruled out.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the political optics in both Canada and India make attendance problematic without a significant thaw in relations. For Canadian PM Trudeau, inviting Modi without clear progress on the Nijjar investigation would be domestically costly. For PM Modi, accepting might be seen as weakness. Given the lack of an invitation at this late stage, the path to a 'Yes' outcome is narrow.\n\nI would update my forecast towards 'Yes' upon credible reports of an invitation being extended or a significant public de-escalation between the two countries. I would update towards 'No' if Canada formally announces the final list of invitees and India is not on it.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill India's PM Narendra Modi attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of India: [Canada invites Australia, Ukraine for G7 meet but no call for India yet](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/canada-invites-australia-ukraine-for-g7-meet-but-no-call-for-india-yet/articleshow/121398906.cms)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
