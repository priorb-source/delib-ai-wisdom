    "review": "Both forecasters make important points I initially underweighted. Forecaster 3's quantitative framework is particularly valuable, especially the Bayesian observation that the criteria haven't been satisfied since mid-April. This empirical evidence - roughly 25 days without a single occurrence - is crucial data I should have weighted more heavily. If we've gone this long without both papers omitting tariffs on the same day, that suggests the daily probability (p) of both papers omitting the term is quite low, perhaps 2-4%. Forecaster 3's binomial calculations are sound: even with 22 remaining days, if p≈3%, the cumulative probability is only around 50%.\n\nForecaster 2's 70% seems too optimistic given the empirical evidence. While their logic about front-page volatility is correct in principle, the observed data contradicts the assumption that p is high enough to make a Yes \"highly probable.\" The constraint that BOTH papers must omit it on the SAME day is more restrictive than I initially credited.\n\nHowever, I also note that Memorial Day weekend and potential competing news events in late May could provide opportunities. The WSJ's business focus does make tariff coverage more likely, which both forecasters correctly emphasize.",
    "rationale": "Using Bayesian reasoning: we've observed approximately 25 days since the open date without the condition being satisfied. With a Beta(1,1) prior, updating to Beta(1,26) gives an expected daily probability of both papers omitting tariffs of roughly 1/27 ≈ 3.7%. Over the remaining ~22 days until June 1, the probability of at least one occurrence is: 1-(0.963)^22 ≈ 56%.\n\nThis calculation suggests my initial 55% was reasonably calibrated, though perhaps slightly low. The empirical evidence is the strongest signal available. While factors like Memorial Day and news cycle volatility provide some upside case, the observed base rate over 25 days is powerful evidence that tariffs remain front-page material for at least one paper most days.\n\nI'm adjusting slightly upward from 55% to 52% - essentially holding my ground but acknowledging the quantitative framework supports something in the 50-56% range. This reflects: (1) the low observed daily probability, (2) the 22 remaining opportunities, (3) uncertainty about late-May news cycles, and (4) the symmetric nature of the problem making this genuinely close to a coin flip.",
