    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the same core constraints I cited: extreme time compression, Libya’s divided institutions, and no public momentum. Forecaster 2’s focus on the HoR’s limited functionality is on point and supports a very low near‑term base rate. Forecaster 3’s framing is broadly sound, though the claim that only Eritrea and Somalia also haven’t ratified may be imprecise; that detail doesn’t materially change the short‑term odds. Neither adds concrete, new signals of movement; their main contribution is calibration toward the lower end based on institutional paralysis. I find F2’s 2% somewhat aggressive but defensible given Libya’s gridlock; F3’s 10% feels a bit high absent any sign of an agenda item or cabinet action.",
    "rationale": "a) About 2 months remain (through June 30).\nb) Status quo: Libya signed years ago but hasn’t ratified; no visible legislative or executive steps underway; deposit with the AU would still be required after any vote.\nc) No scenario: Ongoing political fragmentation prevents the HoR from prioritizing or passing ratification; bureaucratic steps and deposit don’t occur before July 1.\nd) Yes scenario: A sudden political/diplomatic push (e.g., linked to AU mid‑year engagements or an economic policy package) leads to expedited HoR approval and rapid deposit in June.\n e) Evidence/Reasoning: Late-stage ratifications without prior signaling are uncommon, especially in divided systems. Libya’s dual-power environment raises coordination costs for treaty ratification and instrument deposit. With no credible reports of agenda placement or executive prioritization, the base rate over a 60‑day window is very low. The peers’ arguments largely confirm this; they don’t introduce new positive signals, nudging me slightly lower on calibration but not near 0% because rapid ratifications can occur when politically expedient.\nUpdate: I trim my estimate modestly from 7% to 6% to reflect time compression and lack of catalysts, while keeping a small tail for a fast‑track move.",
