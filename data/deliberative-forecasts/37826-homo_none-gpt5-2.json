    "review": "Both forecasters’ reasoning is broadly aligned with mine and adds two useful refinements: (1) definitional tightness excluding both Pakistan-administered Kashmir incidents and BSF-initiated fire along the international border (since BSF is not part of the Armed Forces), and (2) early monsoon/late-June weather marginally complicating air operations. They also note modest political incentives in June 2025 absent a trigger. None of this raises the probability; if anything, it trims it. Their trigger lists and indicators to watch match my own. I find their arguments convincing and directionally consistent; the BSF exclusion is the most impactful new point, slightly lowering the odds within this narrow window.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining and baseline: We’re ~5–6 weeks from resolution, with the operative window limited to June. Absent a precipitating event, the base rate for Indian Armed Forces striking Pakistan proper is very low (notable recent precedent is Balakot 2019). The 2021 ceasefire has generally held, and most routine kinetic exchanges occur either along the LoC/AKJ or via BSF/Pakistan Rangers on the IB—both excluded by the question’s criteria. \nPathways: A Yes outcome likely requires a mass-casualty attack in India with credible attribution to Pakistan-based groups, followed by rapid, visible Indian decision-making (CCS meetings), signaling (public threats), operational indicators (IAF forward deployments, NOTAMs/airspace changes), and a limited standoff strike into KP or Punjab. In the absence of such a shock, India has strong incentives to avoid crossing into Pakistan proper given escalation risks and international pressure, and would more likely confine responses to the LoC/AKJ or covert/deniable actions. Late June weather marginally complicates air ops but is secondary to the trigger question. \nUpdate from deliberation: The explicit exclusion of BSF activity and Pakistan-administered Kashmir incidents reduces the set of plausible qualifying events more than my initial articulation. With no known trigger as of now and a narrow one-month window, I slightly lower my estimate to reflect these constraints. Key up- and down-side indicators remain as previously outlined by all three of us.",
