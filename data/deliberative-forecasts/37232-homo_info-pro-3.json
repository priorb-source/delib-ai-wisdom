    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis hinges on the high probability of a Q1 earnings report being posted on the News page in May. This is a logical assumption for many public companies. However, my initial analysis suspected, and Forecaster 3's analysis explicitly confirms, that this assumption is incorrect for Virgin Galactic. Forecaster 3 introduces the crucial, new information that Virgin Galactic's financial results are typically distributed via Investor Relations and press wires, not the main 'News' page. This evidence directly refutes Forecaster 2's central argument and makes their forecast unconvincing. Forecaster 3's reasoning, however, is highly compelling. It aligns perfectly with my initial assessment but provides stronger, more specific evidence. It validates my observation about the Q4 2024 earnings non-post, elevating it from a single precedent to a consistent company policy. This new information effectively neutralizes the primary counterargument to a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 75% to 85%. My initial forecast was based on the company's recent three-month silence and operational hiatus, but I reserved a significant 25% chance for a 'No' outcome, primarily due to the possibility of a Q1 earnings report press release in May. The key piece of new information from Forecaster 3—that Virgin Galactic has a practice of posting financial news separately through Investor Relations rather than on its main 'News' page—is a game-changer. This information effectively removes the most predictable and probable driver for a news post in May. With the earnings report catalyst now largely nullified, the probability of a 'Yes' outcome (no post) increases substantially. The remaining 15% probability of a 'No' outcome accounts for less predictable events, such as a major partnership announcement or a significant technical milestone with the Delta fleet, which are still possible but far less certain. The aformentioned deliberation has increased my confidence in the evidence supporting the status quo of no new posts.",
