  "information": "The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) receives approximately 5,000-6,000 total UFO reports annually. The 'Pilot' report subtype constitutes about 1% of these, amounting to 30-60 reports worldwide per year. Non-US pilot reports are less frequent, with about 3-5 recorded annually from outside the United States. Reports from South American countries average around 1-2 per year. Specific examples of recent pilot reports from the continent logged in the NUFORC database include a sighting in Brazil in December 2024 and one from a Chilean Air Force crew in February 2023. The NUFORC system is based in the United States and uses an English-language reporting form.\n\nThe U.S. government's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officially document and investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). In 2020, the Department of Defense established a UAP Task Force to track and analyze sightings. According to official data, 757 UAP reports were documented between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. As of the latest report, only 49 of these cases have been officially closed. A report submitted to the U.S. Congress stated that of the 757 observations, no evidence suggested extraterrestrial origin; analysis indicated approximately 70% of the objects were balloons and 16% were drones.\n\nA number of high-profile encounters between military aircraft and UAPs have been reported in North America. In an incident on January 19, 2023, a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet collided with an unidentified object during a training mission over Arizona, cracking the aircraft's canopy. This event was one of 22 UAP sightings reported by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. Arizona, particularly near military training zones, is described as a hotspot for such sightings. Some U.S. officials have suggested these objects may be advanced drones. In a separate event on September 17, 2024, an Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with a dark grey, football-sized cylindrical object over California.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, with the resolution occurring on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Given the historical frequency, it is most likely that no such report will be logged for the specific month of June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The month of June 2025 concludes without any pilots flying over South America submitting a UFO/UAP report to NUFORC that gets posted. Alternatively, a sighting might occur, but the pilot reports it to a local authority instead, or simply does not file a report. As a result, when the source is checked after July 1, 2025, no qualifying entry exists.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial, private, or military pilot has a compelling UAP sighting in the airspace of a South American country during June 2025. The pilot is aware of NUFORC as a reporting venue and submits a detailed account in English. NUFORC processes and posts the report, correctly dating it to June 2025 and categorizing it as a 'Pilot' report.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the low historical frequency of the specified event. The research indicates that NUFORC logs only 1-2 pilot reports from South America per year. This establishes a low base rate. On a monthly basis, this translates to a probability of approximately 1/12 (8.3%) to 2/12 (16.7%). The status quo is that such a report for any given month is unlikely.\n\nMy forecast of 8% is at the lower end of this range for two key reasons. First, NUFORC is a US-based, English-language reporting center, which creates a significant barrier to entry for many pilots in South America, who may prefer local channels or not be aware of NUFORC. Second, the criteria are highly specific: it must be a 'pilot' report, occur in 'June 2025', be from 'South America', and be posted on the NUFORC site. Each condition narrows the probability.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because such reports, while rare, are not impossible. The database contains recent precedent with reports from Brazil (December 2024) and Chile (February 2023), confirming that the reporting pathway exists and is occasionally used. A probability near zero would incorrectly dismiss this possibility.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because that would disregard the very strong signal from the low base rate. While general UAP interest is high, there is no specific evidence to suggest a sudden surge in reporting from South American pilots to this particular US database is imminent for June 2025.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were a cluster of South American pilot reports in the months leading up to June 2025, or if a major, widely-publicized UAP event occurred over the continent. I would decrease it if NUFORC experienced significant reporting backlogs or if new information suggested pilots in the region were being directed to other reporting systems.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in South America in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) a sighting in Brazil in December 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the South American continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) receives approximately 5,000-6,000 total UFO reports annually.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
