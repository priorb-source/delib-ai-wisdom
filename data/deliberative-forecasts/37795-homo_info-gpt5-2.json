    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds concrete, decision-relevant numbers I hadn’t fully quantified: an 8–38 (.174) Rockies with a ~.112 gap to the next-worst (~.286) and a back-of-the-envelope showing another team would need an extreme 25-game collapse (e.g., 3–22) to undercut even modest COL improvement. That framing is persuasive and aligns with how quickly cumulative win% becomes inert with a large early deficit. Forecaster 3 raises useful cautions about short-horizon variance, timing of the Metaculus “on or after” check, and tie ambiguity. However, their quasi-naive “split among 3–5 teams” logic underweights the present, outsized gap and the compounding effect of cumulative records; the situation isn’t a symmetric cluster right now. Net: F2’s quantitative thresholds meaningfully strengthen the case for Yes; F3’s points shave a few percentage points but don’t overturn it.",
    "rationale": "Updated view: The current gap matters. If Colorado is 8–38 (.174) with ~25–28 games until June 15, even a relative uptick (say 9–16 over 25, .360) only gets them to roughly 17–54 (~.239). A trailing team starting near .286 (e.g., 12–30) would need to go about 3–22 to finish below ~.239 — a tail outcome. If Colorado plays closer to .28–.32 over the next ~25 games (more likely given their underlying talent), their cumulative percentage remains nearer .21–.24, which would require a rival to win ≤0–4 games in 25 to end up below them — extremely unlikely. The “minimum of a few bad teams” effect adds some risk that someone else has a disastrous month, and there’s a sliver of uncertainty from the Admin check timing and potential tie interpretation. Those factors keep me from the 90s, but the current-state gap and COL’s poor underlying metrics make Yes the dominant outcome. I’m moving up from 80% to reflect the quantified gap and threshold math in F2’s analysis, while incorporating F3’s timing/ties caveats as small discounts.",
