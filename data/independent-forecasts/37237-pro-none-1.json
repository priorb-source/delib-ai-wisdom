    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The US Census Bureau is expected to release the U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services report for April 2025 in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "US imports increase year-over-year. Driven by underlying US economic growth and persistent inflation, the nominal dollar value of imports continues its long-term upward trend, exceeding the April 2024 level of $338.5 billion.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A significant slowdown in the US economy reduces consumer and business demand for foreign goods. This effect is amplified by newly implemented, broad-based tariffs that successfully curb import volumes, causing the total value of imports to fall below the April 2024 level.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The US economy continues to expand, and persistent inflation increases the nominal value of goods. These fundamental economic factors create upward momentum that surpasses any dampening effects from new trade policies, leading to the total value of imports in April 2025 exceeding the April 2024 figure.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored on the strong historical trend of year-over-year growth in nominal US imports, which is propelled by real GDP growth and inflation. For context, imports grew by approximately 3.5% between April 2023 and April 2024. A continuation of this trend, or even just the isolated effect of 2-3% inflation on the $338.5 billion baseline, would be sufficient to resolve this question as 'Yes'. The principal factor arguing against this outcome is a significant shift in trade policy, such as the implementation of broad new tariffs following the 2024 election, as alluded to in the background material. Such tariffs, potentially effective since early 2025, would aim to reduce import volumes. However, their initial impact on total import value can be ambiguous, as higher prices could temporarily inflate the total value, and behavioral shifts take time. Absent a full-blown economic recession, the upward pressure from baseline economic growth and inflation is more likely to result in a nominal increase in import value than a decrease. Therefore, the balance of probabilities favors a 'Yes' outcome. My forecast is not higher than 65% to account for the substantial uncertainty and downside risk introduced by potential protectionist trade policies and the possibility of a cooling US economy. It is not lower because a year-over-year decline in nominal imports is historically rare outside of major recessions, and the tailwind from inflation provides a significant buffer.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US imports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of imports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 338,483 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
