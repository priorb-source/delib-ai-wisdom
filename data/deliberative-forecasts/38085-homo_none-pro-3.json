    "review": "The deliberation with my colleagues was productive, centering on the key conflict between the inertia of the existing drought and the powerful climatological pressure of Florida's impending wet season. All three of us identified this as the central issue. Forecaster 2 made a particularly compelling case for the strength of drought inertia, arguing that even a normal start to the rainy season might not be sufficient to reverse an established drought in just one month. I found this point persuasive; my initial analysis may have underestimated how slowly the official drought classifications, which integrate long-term indicators, might respond to improved rainfall. Forecaster 3's analysis was closely aligned with my own but assigned slightly more weight to the drought's persistence, arriving at a 45% probability. The consensus is that this is a very close call, and after considering the strength of the inertia argument, I agree that my initial forecast was likely too confident in a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "My core reasoning remains that the most powerful factor influencing the outcome over the next 30 days is the climatological onset of Florida's wet season, which strongly favors drought alleviation. However, the deliberation has convinced me to assign more weight to the resilience of the current drought. As Forecaster 2 noted, drought exhibits significant inertia. Even with daily thunderstorms, improvements in long-term indicators like groundwater and reservoir levels can lag, meaning the official number of residents in drought on the resolution source might not fall below the 14.0 million threshold within the 30-day timeframe. The starting point is exactly at the threshold, so conditions only need to persist, not worsen, for a 'Yes' resolution. I am therefore updating my forecast to better reflect the near-50/50 nature of this conflict between a strong status quo and a strong seasonal forcing event. I am increasing my probability from 35% to 45% to account for this increased weight on the drought's inertia.",
