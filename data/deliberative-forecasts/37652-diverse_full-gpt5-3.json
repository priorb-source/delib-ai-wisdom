    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the new-leader honeymoon and Trump’s historically low-to-mid 40s approval, which aligns with my base case. Forecaster 2’s 85% feels aggressive because it understates two risks: (1) Morning Consult rounding/tie risk (a tie resolves No), and (2) the July 1 timing of Carney’s pledge to eliminate interprovincial trade barriers—if that slips or is seen as performative, it could generate negative press precisely in the late-June measurement window. Forecaster 3’s 72% is closer to my view and appropriately flags the lack of current approval data. Neither added new hard data, but the short time horizon and honeymoon base rate they stress do modestly strengthen the case for Yes. I remain cautious about a late-June Trump bump from high-salience news (e.g., court decisions) nudging him into the mid/upper-40s, which combined with any Carney wobble could yield a tie or slight deficit.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~6.5 weeks. Mechanically, Morning Consult’s 7-day SMA around July 1 will mostly reflect late June. Base rates: new PMs typically enjoy elevated approval for 1–3 months; Trump’s approval tends to hover in the low-to-mid 40s with a hard ceiling in the upper 40s. Pre-election data suggested Carney’s personal numbers were already relatively strong, and his stance against U.S. tariffs likely sustains early support. These factors favor Yes. Key downside risks into late June: failure/slippage on the July 1 interprovincial barrier pledge; no tangible wins from Washington; perceived drift from delaying the budget; and any U.S. news cycle pushing Trump to 46–48%. Tie risk matters because ties resolve No. Netting these, I slightly raise my prior (70%) given the reinforcing arguments on the honeymoon effect and short runway, but I don’t follow Forecaster 2 to the mid-80s due to the specific July 1 deliverable risk and tie/rounding considerations. I would update up if we see MC showing Carney ≥50% and Trump ≤43% in mid/late June; down if Canadian headlines turn negative on missed promises or if Trump prints sustained 46–47% in late June.",
