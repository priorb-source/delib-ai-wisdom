    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling points I should have emphasized more strongly. Forecaster 2 correctly highlights that Byron Donalds has already announced with Trump's backing - this is crucial information that fundamentally shapes the race dynamics. Casey would be entering as a challenger to an incumbent-supported candidate, not joining an open field. Forecaster 3's observation that 'each day without news makes No more certain' is particularly apt given the compression of the timeline. Both forecasters (15% and 16%) converged on lower probabilities than mine, emphasizing the absence of visible campaign infrastructure more heavily than I did. The lack of staff hires, fundraising committees, or exploratory signals is indeed a very strong contrary indicator that I underweighted. However, I maintain that the June 30 fundraising deadline provides a natural catalyst that prevents going lower than mid-teens. The combination of Donalds already being in the race, the Hope Florida probe, and zero visible preparation makes a rushed announcement highly unlikely but not impossible.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating downward but not as low as 15%. The key factors driving my adjustment: (1) Donalds has already formally announced with Trump backing - this means the field is taking shape without her and she'd be entering a more defined race; (2) The complete absence of campaign infrastructure (no staff, no filings, no domain registrations) is a stronger signal than I initially weighted; (3) Twenty-six days is an extremely compressed timeline for launching a statewide gubernatorial campaign without any visible preparation. However, I'm not going as low as 15% because: (1) The June 30 Q2 fundraising deadline remains a genuine catalyst for a potential surprise announcement; (2) Casey DeSantis has exceptional name recognition and political network in Florida that could enable a faster-than-normal launch; (3) Political actors sometimes make unconventional moves when facing adverse dynamics. The clustering of forecasts at 15-17% suggests this range appropriately captures the low but non-trivial probability.",
