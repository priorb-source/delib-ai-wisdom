    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds useful operational detail I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: temporary generators “expected” by end-April and a permanent fix not until August. That supports the idea that underlying constraints persist beyond April, but also gives a plausible pathway for authorities to feel comfortable letting the SOE lapse if the temporary units are in place or imminent. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on the explicit April 29 end date and the absence (as of Apr 21) of any extension signal is a fair point; many governments announce extensions close to expiry, but a lack of signaling with a week to go is still weakly informative toward ‘No’. I’m skeptical of the “16% of GDP” cost claim—it isn’t sourced and seems overstated—so I discount that. Overall, both analyses appropriately weight the scheduled end date more than I did, and they highlight political/communication dynamics I should factor in. I still think they underweight integration/commissioning lags for temporary generators and Samoa’s comfort with rolling monthly extensions in prior emergencies, but their arguments move me somewhat toward No.",
    "rationale": "Status quo is No because the current SOE expires Apr 29. A Yes requires an extension or a new declaration covering Apr 30. The crisis drivers (generation shortfall, reliance on temporary rentals, permanent fix months away) make a short extension plausible, especially if installation/commissioning slips or if the government wants to retain emergency procurement/mandate powers into early May. Against extension: political and economic optics of prolonging an SOE; if temporary units are delivered and effectively integrated by late April such that load-shedding can be managed under ordinary authorities, leadership may prefer to let the SOE lapse. With nine days left and no extension signal yet, I trim my odds below even, but keep them materially positive given likely operational lags and the ease of issuing short extensions. I’m updating down from 58% to 45% on the strength of the scheduled end date and lack of extension signaling, while maintaining a substantial chance due to ongoing infrastructure constraints and the non-trivial risk of slippage in temporary solutions.",
