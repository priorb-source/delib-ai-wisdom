    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services report for April 2025 is typically released by the US Census Bureau in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Absent significant policy changes or economic shocks, underlying US economic growth and persistent inflation would likely cause the nominal value of imports to be slightly higher than the previous year.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The implementation of significant new tariffs, as alluded to in the background context, successfully curtails import volumes. This, potentially combined with a modest economic slowdown in the US or a significant drop in the price of a key import like oil, causes the total import value to fall below the April 2024 level.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Resilient US consumer and business demand, potentially fueled by a strong dollar, proves more powerful than the dampening effect of new tariffs. Inflation continues to push up the nominal value of goods, and businesses may even import more to build inventories, causing the total value to exceed the April 2024 threshold.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is finely balanced, as recent import data has been fluctuating very close to the April 2024 threshold of $338.5 billion. The primary tension is between two opposing forces. On one hand, the status quo of modest economic growth and persistent inflation provides a strong baseline expectation for a year-over-year increase in the nominal value of imports. On the other hand, the background information points to a significant policy intervention: new tariffs under a Trump administration. Such tariffs are explicitly designed to reduce imports, acting as a powerful headwind against the status quo trend. My forecast gives significant weight to this policy intervention as the primary new variable changing the outlook from a simple trend extrapolation. The probability is not lower because US demand for imports is historically resilient and often inelastic, meaning the value could hold steady or even rise despite tariffs if price increases outweigh volume decreases. The probability is not higher because the explicit goal of the suggested tariff policy is to reduce imports, and ignoring such a direct and impactful policy change would be a significant forecasting error. I would update my forecast towards 'Yes' if early trade indicators for April (e.g., port traffic data) showed surprising strength, or if the implemented tariffs proved to be narrower in scope or less impactful than anticipated. I would update towards 'No' if data revealed a sharper-than-expected slowdown in the US economy during Q1 and early Q2 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US imports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of imports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 338,483 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
