    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement is made; martial law continues and authorities defer scheduling until conditions change.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine remains under martial law with ongoing security and logistical constraints; the Verkhovna Rada does not pass a resolution setting an election date and the CEC makes no date announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Political leadership signals an imminent lifting or easing of martial law and the Verkhovna Rada adopts a resolution in June setting a specific presidential election date (e.g., in autumn 2025), which is then publicly announced by the competent authority (Rada/CEC).",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/legal constraints: Ukrainian law bans holding national elections during martial law, and practice to date has been to extend martial law in 90‑day increments and defer elections. Announcing a specific date while still under martial law would be unusual and politically risky absent a clear plan to lift it. The status quo therefore strongly points to no announcement in the next ~6 weeks.\n- Process/timing: Even if leadership wanted a fall 2025 election, the usual pattern is to set dates roughly within the statutory pre‑election period (around 90 days). Announcing much earlier than necessary, particularly amid uncertainty about security and the duration of martial law, is unlikely.\n- Incentives: Kyiv and key partners have prioritized wartime governance continuity and security over electoral timelines. Logistical issues (frontline areas, displaced voters, millions abroad) remain hard to solve quickly.\n- Why not higher: A Yes would require a sharp shift—e.g., credible ceasefire prospects and clear intent to lift martial law—or a legal/political push to authorize elections under martial law, followed by a rapid parliamentary decision and official announcement before July 1. That chain is possible but improbable on this short timeline.\n- Why not lower: There is a small tail risk that, to bolster legitimacy or respond to domestic/international pressure, authorities pre‑commit to a specific date in late 2025 and announce it in June, especially if signals emerge about easing martial law or if a legal workaround is introduced.\n- What would move me up: 1) Official statements indicating martial law will be lifted in the next extension cycle; 2) Draft bills in the Rada to schedule the presidential election or to permit elections during martial law; 3) Public coordination with the CEC/OSCE on election timelines; 4) A ceasefire or major de‑escalation.\n- What would move me down: 1) Another routine 90‑day extension of martial law signaled for late June; 2) Leadership reiterating that elections will wait until after the war with no timeline; 3) Deteriorating security conditions.\n- Research assistant provided no new information; this forecast leans on the strong inertia of the current legal/political framework and the short horizon to July 1, 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine announce a presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Next Ukrainian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_presidential_election)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
