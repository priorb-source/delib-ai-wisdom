    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize Morning Consult’s smoothing and the historical pattern that UK PMs in early tenure tend to sit in the low/mid‑30s while Japan’s PMs often reside high‑20s/low‑30s. They also downweight the late‑May inversion (Ishiba > Starmer) as either non‑MC or transient. That’s a useful reminder to lean more on MC’s medium‑run behavior and not overreact to single mentions. They also note Japan’s scandal overhang, which plausibly caps Ishiba in the near term. Where I’m less convinced: (1) if the late‑May flip was indeed MC, smoothing would actually keep Ishiba competitive into June; (2) UK‑specific near‑term risks (June 11 spending review and civil service cuts) look asymmetric to the downside for Starmer; and (3) a tie resolves No, which matters when the spread is small. Overall, their arguments nudge me modestly toward Yes versus my prior, but not to >50%.",
    "rationale": "Status quo remains close and noisy. The most recent conflicting indications (early May Starmer > Ishiba; late May possibly the reverse) suggest a narrow spread either way. MC’s 7‑day averaging and a monthly update cadence reduce the chance of a large late‑June swing. I give some additional weight to the historical MC pattern favoring Starmer by a couple points, and to the possibility that the late‑May inversion wasn’t an MC reading or was short‑lived, which slightly increases the chance that Starmer is marginally higher by the July check. Offsetting that are: (a) tie risk (resolves No), (b) a plausible UK backlash around the June 11 spending review and civil service cuts, and (c) Ishiba’s potential to stabilize around ~30–32% as scandal salience fades. Net effect: I edge up from 45% to 48%, acknowledging the prior that Starmer ≳ Ishiba but keeping sub‑50 given event risk and tie penalty.",
