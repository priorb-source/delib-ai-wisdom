    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "7 days - the election is scheduled for April 28, 2025, and results should be known within 24 hours of voting",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The People's National Movement (PNM) wins the most seats, maintaining their position as the governing party. PNM currently holds power after winning 22 of 41 seats in the 2020 general election versus 19 for the opposition United National Congress (UNC)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The United National Congress mobilizes effectively in the final week of campaigning, capitalizing on economic discontent or governance issues. Lower-than-expected PNM voter turnout combined with high UNC enthusiasm leads to the opposition winning 21+ seats and forming the next government",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The PNM leverages incumbent advantages including government resources, name recognition, and organizational capacity. Their voter base remains loyal despite any economic challenges, and they successfully defend their marginal constituencies from 2020, winning at least 21 seats to secure a plurality",
    "rationale": "With only one week until the election, we are very close to the outcome. The status quo strongly favors forecasting that PNM will win the most seats since they currently hold power and won the previous election. In two-party systems like Trinidad and Tobago's, incumbent governments have structural advantages including greater visibility, resources, and established ground operations. The 2020 result (22-19 in favor of PNM) shows a competitive but clear PNM advantage. However, I face a significant information deficit - my research assistant provided no polling data, campaign developments, economic indicators, or recent political news that would inform whether the race has tightened or shifted. The close 2020 margin suggests this could be competitive. My forecast would be higher (toward 70%+) if I had: polling showing a comfortable PNM lead, evidence of strong economic performance, or signs of UNC organizational weaknesses. My forecast would be lower (toward 40-45%) if I had: polling showing UNC ahead or tied, evidence of major economic problems or scandals, or indicators of high anti-incumbent sentiment. Given the information vacuum but respecting the status quo bias principle, I forecast a modest PNM advantage while acknowledging substantial uncertainty in what appears to be a competitive two-party race",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
