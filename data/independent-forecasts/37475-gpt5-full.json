  "information": "The recall was initiated by Johnsonville LLC on April 5, 2025, for approximately 22,672 pounds of its cheddar bratwurst product due to potential contamination with hard plastic. The affected products were produced on a single date, February 5, 2025, and bear the establishment number 'Est. 1647'. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) classified this as a Class I recall, indicating a high health risk. The recall was prompted by two consumer complaints, but no confirmed injuries have been reported. The product was distributed to retail locations in ten states: Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The FSIS has noted concerns that the product may still be in consumers' freezers.\n\nThe FSIS follows a structured process for closing recalls. This process involves verifying that the recalling firm has notified all its customers, confirming that the product has been removed from circulation, conducting effectiveness checks to ensure the product is no longer available to consumers, and verifying that the company has implemented corrective actions. For Class I recalls, which are deemed high-risk, the FSIS enforces more rigorous verification requirements before it can be closed. Recalls involving foreign material contamination necessitate a comprehensive investigation into the source of the contaminant and the implementation of effective preventive measures.\n\nHistorical data on similar FSIS recalls provides context for typical closure timelines. Many previous recalls handled by Johnsonville were closed within 4 to 8 weeks. Broader data for Class I meat recalls of a similar size often shows closure within 2 to 4 months after the announcement. However, some cases can take longer; a recall for Tyson Fun Nuggets in 2023 took approximately four months to close. A January 2025 report from the Plastic Pollution Coalition also mentioned that several recalls from 2024 involving plastic contamination remained ongoing for several months after their initiation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 52 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall remains listed as Active on the FSIS page by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Effectiveness checks drag on or the recall expands (e.g., additional lots/dates or states are added), or FSIS waits on corrective-action verification/root-cause documentation. As a result, the FSIS status remains Active into July.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Johnsonville completes notifications and product recovery quickly, FSIS effectiveness checks verify removal from commerce, no expansion occurs, and corrective actions are accepted. The FSIS page flips from Active to Closed in late May or June.",
    "rationale": "Key facts: The recall (Class I, foreign material/plastic) was initiated April 5, 2025, covering a single production date and ~22,672 lbs distributed across 10 states. No injuries reported; triggered by two complaints. FSIS notes concern product may still be in consumers’ freezers, but closure depends on effectiveness checks and corrective actions, not full retrieval from consumers.\n\nTimelines: The assistant notes many Johnsonville recalls historically close in 4–8 weeks; broader Class I recalls of similar size typically close in 2–4 months, with occasional longer tails (e.g., Tyson Fun Nuggets ~4 months; some plastic contamination cases lingering for months). July 1 is ~12.5 weeks after the April 5 announcement, which sits near the upper end of the common 2–4 month window and beyond the 4–8 week pattern Johnsonville often achieves. That makes closure by July 1 plausible-to-likely, but not a lock.\n\nWhy not higher: Class I foreign material recalls can encounter delays from root-cause investigations, documentation of corrective actions, and thorough effectiveness checks across multiple states. Any expansion or new complaints would likely push closure past July 1. Also, status quo bias: as of now the recall is Active, and FSIS closures sometimes post later than firms expect.\n\nWhy not lower: The scope is modest (single date, ~22.7k lbs), Johnsonville is experienced with recalls, and no injuries have been confirmed. Many similar recalls close within 2–3 months, so there is ample time (around 7+ weeks remaining) to complete FSIS verification and flip to Closed before July 1 if no complications arise.\n\nUpdates that would move the forecast:\n- Up: FSIS/firm updates indicating effectiveness checks largely completed; evidence of no expansion; retailer notices showing removal complete; Johnsonville publishing corrective actions/root-cause findings.\n- Down: Any recall expansion (new lots/dates/states), additional consumer injury reports, or FSIS notes indicating extended verification/corrective-action review; signs of product still in commerce at retail late into June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Johnsonville LLC of cheddar bratwurst for foreign matter contamination issued April 5, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReal Simple: [Over 22,000 Pounds of a Popular Sausage Brand Recalled Due to Contamination](https://www.realsimple.com/sausage-recall-2025-11711268)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
