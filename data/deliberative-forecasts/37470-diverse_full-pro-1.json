    "review": "The other forecasters presented two compelling arguments that I had insufficiently weighted. First, they correctly noted that at 18-20 months out, we are already past the ITKF's typical 24-36 month announcement window, which significantly lowers the baseline expectation of an imminent decision. My initial analysis noted this window but did not treat being outside of it as a strong negative indicator. Second, Forecaster 3's point that such decisions are often tied to formal events like federation congresses, which may not be scheduled before the July 1 deadline, provides a plausible structural reason for a delay. I found these arguments highly convincing, as they ground the forecast in typical organizational behavior and timelines, revealing that my initial 70% forecast was an overreaction to the recent positive news.",
    "rationale": "I am substantially updating my forecast downwards from 70% to 45%. My previous forecast overweighted the positive signal from the high-level meeting between Egypt's Sports Minister and the ITKF President and underweighted the structural factors highlighted by my peers. The fact that the typical announcement window has already passed, combined with the short (less than two months) timeframe for a bureaucratic decision, makes a 'No' outcome more likely than I had assessed. However, I am not lowering my forecast to the 30-40% range because I believe the specific circumstances here warrant a higher probability. The meeting was at the highest level, the ITKF President's comments were a very strong public endorsement, and most importantly, there are no other known competing bids. This 'sole bidder' status could allow the ITKF to bypass a lengthy competitive review process and expedite the decision via an executive board vote, which could plausibly happen before July 1. Therefore, while I agree with the other forecasters' caution, I believe the uniquely positive signals in this specific case keep the probability of a timely announcement higher than they estimate.",
