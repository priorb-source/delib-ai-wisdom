  "information": "In 2020, the Zimbabwean government and representatives of white farmers signed a Global Compensation Deed for a total of $3.5 billion to compensate approximately 4,000 farmers for developments on seized land. On or around April 9, 2025, the government made its first payment of $3.1 million. This disbursement is part of a plan for a first batch of 740 approved claims, totaling $311 million. The initial payment represents 1% of this amount, with the agreement stipulating that the remaining 99% is to be settled through the issuance of 10-year treasury bonds. According to reports, the initial cash payment was distributed to either 21 or 378 farmers. The compensation is explicitly for 'improvements' made on the land, not for the land itself.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5.5 weeks (roughly 38–39 days) until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no additional payment is made before June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Administrative, legal, or funding delays push both the next cash tranche and the planned issuance/allocation of 10-year compensation bonds into June or later; the April 9 payment remains the only disbursement by the cutoff.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Treasury finalizes and allocates the 10-year bonds to the first batch of approved claimants in May, or it makes a second small USD cash tranche to additional farmers; this is reported by credible media before June 1.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and Zimbabwe’s execution risk is high. The status quo outcome is usually that new processes in Zimbabwe roll out slowly after an initial symbolic step, so I put extra weight on a “No” by default. Evidence: On/around April 9, 2025 the government made the first compensation payment of $3.1m under the 2020 Global Compensation Deed. This was described as 1% cash for a first batch of 740 approved claims totaling $311m, with the remaining 99% to be settled via 10-year treasury bonds. Reports differ on how many farmers received the initial cash (21 vs. 378), suggesting some administrative churn. The government publicly reaffirmed its commitment on April 10, which is a positive signal, but actual fiscal capacity and instrument setup (drafting, registering, and allocating the bonds) could easily slip beyond a five‑week window. Why not higher: Zimbabwe’s chronic USD scarcity, history of delayed implementation, and potential need to finalize bond documentation/listing/settlement mechanics argue for slippage. Also, after a first symbolic payment, authorities may not feel compelled to rush a second before June 1. Why not lower: The cohort and mechanism are defined, the amount needed for another small tranche is modest, and the government has incentive to show momentum to creditors/partners during reengagement—making a May follow‑on (cash or bond allocation) plausible. Upward updates: credible reporting that the 10‑year bonds have been created/registered and are scheduled for allocation in May; Afreximbank or Treasury announcements detailing imminent disbursements; farmers’ unions confirming receipt timelines. Downward updates: official indications that bond issuance will occur later in 2025; reports of liquidity/currency pressures crowding out near‑term payments; new verification disputes among claimants.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Zimbabwe, before June 1, 2025, make another payment to white farmers whose property was seized?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Zimbabwe reaffirms commitment to land compensation to spur growth, debt sustainability](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/04/10/zimbabwe-reaffirms-commitment-to-land-compensation-to-spur-growth-debt-sustainability)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) the government of Zimbabwe after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 makes an additional payment to former farmers covered under the 2020 Global Compensation Deed.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, Zimbabwe [was reported](https://nehandaradio.com/2025/04/09/zimbabwe-pays-us3-1m-to-former-white-farmers-as-part-of-land-compensation-deal/) to have made its first compensation payment, of USD $3.1 million. Additional such disbursements made after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 would count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn 2020, the Zimbabwean government and representatives of white farmers signed a Global Compensation Deed for a total of $3.5 billion to compensate approximately 4,000 farmers for developments on seized land.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
