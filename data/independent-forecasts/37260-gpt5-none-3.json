    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Debate continues and perhaps an application to ban the AfD is filed, but no decision is issued by the Federal Constitutional Court before July 1. Intelligence classifications and political motions occur, but there is no official ban announcement from a competent authority.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A formal ban application is filed immediately and the Federal Constitutional Court takes an unprecedented emergency fast-track, citing newly uncovered, imminent threats to the democratic order, and announces a ban before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Only the Federal Constitutional Court can ban a political party under Article 21(2) of Germany’s Basic Law. Party-ban proceedings historically take many months to years: SRP (~1 year, 1952), KPD (~5 years, 1956), and the two NPD attempts (2001–2003 dismissed; 2013–2017 rejected) were multi-year affairs. The AfD is a major party with substantial representation; any proceeding would involve a vast evidentiary record and is even less likely to be accelerated to a matter of weeks. As of May 2, 2025, there is public debate (e.g., a motion by 124 MPs to initiate proceedings), but a Bundestag majority decision, Bundesrat action, or a federal government application would still be only the start; the Court’s final announcement of a ban by July 1 is extraordinarily unlikely. The research assistant provided no additional information, which I take to mean there is no sign of a near-term, advanced-stage case or pending decision. Why not higher: the compressed timeline and procedural realities make a pre–July 1 ban extraordinarily improbable. Why not lower: I allow a very small tail risk for unforeseen, extraordinary developments (e.g., shocking, well-documented evidence of imminent anti-constitutional action prompting unprecedented expedited measures). What would move me up: confirmed filing by a competent applicant plus the Court publicly announcing expedited proceedings with a stated intention to rule within weeks. What would move me down: continued absence of a filed case and any Court scheduling signals by early June (though my current estimate is already near the floor).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Germany ban the AfD before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nLe Monde: [Germany's Bundestag debates banning far-right AfD party](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/01/31/germany-s-bundestag-debates-banning-far-right-afd-party_6737637_4.html) \"A cross-party group of 124 MPs put a motion on the agenda to bring proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the party, whose unprecedented alliance with the CDU caused a shock.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is an official announcement of a ban on the Alternative for Germany (AfD) by a German government entity with the authority to make such an announcement (e.g., the Federal Constitutional Court).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
