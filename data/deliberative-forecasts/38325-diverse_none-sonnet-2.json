    "review": "Forecaster 2 makes a compelling statistical argument: the 0.4 percentage point upward revision needed to flip from -0.3% to positive is within the typical range of absolute revisions (0.5-0.6 pp), which occurs regularly. This deserves more weight than I initially gave it. However, Forecaster 2's 55% probability seems to overweight this point while underweighting the directional nature of what's required. We don't just need *any* 0.4+ pp revision—we specifically need an *upward* one. If revisions are roughly symmetric (as Forecaster 3 correctly notes), this cuts both ways.\n\nForecaster 3 raises an important compositional argument I overlooked: the Q1 weakness was concentrated in inventories and net exports, while domestic demand was firmer. This composition pattern could create upward revision bias as more complete data becomes available, particularly for services and PCE components that are initially estimated less precisely. This is a meaningful point favoring higher probability.\n\nBoth forecasters appropriately emphasize that -0.3% is extremely close to zero, making it highly vulnerable to revision. However, both also acknowledge that sign flips, while possible, are relatively infrequent historically.\n\nThe key tension: typical revision magnitudes suggest flipping is plausible, but the historical infrequency of sign changes and the need for a specifically directional upward revision suggests caution.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my initial 30% was slightly too conservative. The compositional argument (inventories/net exports drag vs stronger domestic final sales) provides a specific mechanism for upward revision that I underweighted. Additionally, while I noted that 0.5-1.0 pp revisions occur regularly, I didn't fully internalize that a 0.4 pp upward revision is at the lower end of common revision magnitudes.\n\nHowever, I'm not convinced by Forecaster 2's 55% probability. That would imply it's more likely than not that we'll see a sign flip, which seems inconsistent with: (1) the historical frequency of sign changes, (2) the fact that we need specifically an upward revision (symmetric distribution means ~50% chance it goes the other direction), and (3) the advance estimate remaining our best single data point absent the second estimate.\n\nThe appropriate update is upward but modest. The compositional bias toward upward revision and the proximity to zero (making it highly revision-sensitive) warrant moving from 30% to approximately 38%. This reflects increased weight on the plausibility of the needed revision while maintaining appropriate caution about sign flips.",
