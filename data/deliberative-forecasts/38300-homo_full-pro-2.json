    "review": "Both other forecasters presented analyses that were structurally very similar to my own, identifying the same core conflict between strong recent momentum and negative leading indicators. They did not introduce new evidence. However, their reasoning to assign a higher probability (85% vs. my 80%) was convincing. They both more explicitly articulated that for a very short-term forecast (a single month), the existing positive momentum (+1.49% YoY buffer) and contemporaneous indicators (positive PMIs) should be weighted more heavily than longer-term, forward-looking indicators like the LEI and PPI. I find this argument persuasive; while the LEI drop is a serious concern for the second half of the year, its ability to signal a sharp reversal for the immediate month of May is less certain, especially when contrasted with positive survey data for that same month.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast upward. I was persuaded by their shared argument regarding the relative weight of evidence for a near-term forecast. My initial 80% probability placed significant weight on the negative signals from the Conference Board’s LEI and the core PPI. While these indicators point to future weakness, the other forecasters correctly emphasized that a substantial month-over-month contraction in May would be required to erase the +1.49% year-over-year gain from April. The positive May manufacturing PMIs from both ISM and S&P Global, which are more contemporaneous measures of activity, make such a sharp, immediate downturn less likely. Therefore, I am shifting my weighting to more closely reflect the high probability implied by the recent strong momentum and the positive survey data, while still acknowledging the downside risks. I am increasing my forecast from 80% to 85%, aligning with my colleagues.",
