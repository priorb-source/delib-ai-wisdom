    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most important new consideration: the resolution criterion is extremely favorable to a Yes outcome. The question only asks if the site is 'reachable' per IsItDownRightNow - even a simple redirect, archived page, or 'program discontinued' notice would count as Yes. Only complete DNS/host unreachability would count as No. This significantly strengthens the case for Yes beyond what I initially weighted. Forecaster 3 also correctly emphasizes precedent for deprecated federal program pages remaining online with banners rather than being entirely removed. Forecaster 2's analysis aligns closely with mine but slightly more conservative. Both other forecasters make strong points about the negligible cost of maintenance versus the active effort required for takedown. The single-check risk Forecaster 3 mentions (transient outage during Metaculus check) is valid but minor. All three analyses converge on bureaucratic inertia and short timeline as key factors, but Forecaster 3's insight about resolution mechanics is the most significant update to my thinking.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I should increase my forecast based on Forecaster 3's critical insight about resolution mechanics. The bar for Yes is much lower than I initially weighted - merely site reachability, not active program operation or full site maintenance. Combined with: (1) 48-day timeline being extremely short for government website decommissioning, (2) strong historical precedent for leaving deprecated sites online with notices/redirects, (3) negligible ongoing hosting costs versus active shutdown effort, (4) likely legal/administrative requirements for archiving and transition, and (5) the fact that even a minimal landing page or redirect resolves as Yes - the probability should be higher than my initial 80%. However, I remain slightly more conservative than Forecaster 3's 92% because: (1) the EPA director's statement shows clear political will to eliminate the program quickly, (2) this administration has demonstrated willingness to move rapidly on certain initiatives, and (3) while unlikely, a motivated push could theoretically accomplish domain takedown in 48 days. Balancing these factors, I'm updating upward but not to the full 92%.",
