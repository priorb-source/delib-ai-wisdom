    "review": "The other forecasters introduced a crucial piece of evidence I had not originally considered: a band member has not only been investigated but has been formally charged with an offence under the UK's Terrorism Act 2000. Forecaster 2's identification of a specific court date on June 18, just a week before the festival, is particularly convincing as it provides a clear mechanism for a 'No' outcome (e.g., remand or restrictive bail conditions). Forecaster 3's point about other venues already cancelling performances sets a powerful precedent, suggesting risk aversion is the likely path even for defiant organizations. This new information fundamentally escalates the situation from a political controversy, which Glastonbury might weather, to a serious legal and security liability, which is much harder to ignore. Their reasoning is highly persuasive and highlights that the situation is far more severe than my initial assessment.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 40% was based on the premise of a police investigation, creating political and reputational pressure. The new information, supplied by my fellow forecasters, that a band member has been formally charged under the Terrorism Act, significantly increases the probability of a 'No' outcome. A formal charge is a game-changer, elevating the risk for Glastonbury's organizers from a matter of artistic expression to one of public safety, potential legal liability, and compliance with security services. The upcoming court hearing on June 18 is a critical inflection point; a likely outcome is that the court will impose conditions (such as remand or restricted travel) that would make a performance impossible. Even if the band member is released on unconditional bail, the security and insurance implications for hosting a performer on a terror charge at an event for over 200,000 people would likely be insurmountable. The precedents of other venues cancelling the band's shows further suggest that cancellation is the industry-standard response to this level of risk. I am therefore lowering my forecast significantly, from 40% to 30%, to reflect the high probability that either the legal system or the festival's own risk assessment will prevent the performance.",
