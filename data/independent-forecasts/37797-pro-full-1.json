  "information": "Following its plenary meeting in Paris from February 17-21, 2025, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) announced no changes to its 'black list' of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action, which continues to include North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar. During the same plenary, Laos and Nepal were added to the 'grey list' of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, while the Philippines was removed. The FATF also maintained the suspension of Russia's membership, which has been in place since February 2023, without adding the country to either the grey or black lists.\n\nIn February 2025, South Africa's National Treasury reported that the country had addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 FATF action items, with the remaining two expected to be resolved by June 2025. The goal is to facilitate an exit from the grey list by October 2025. In West Africa, a May 2025 meeting of the GIABA Ministerial Committee noted that Senegal had exited the FATF grey list in October 2024. However, four other regional members—Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Côte d'Ivoire—remain on the grey list, with Nigeria's government stating an aim to be removed by the end of May 2025.\n\nIndian government officials announced in May 2025 their intention to submit fresh intelligence to the FATF concerning terrorist infrastructure operating within Pakistan. This development follows Pakistan's removal from the FATF Grey List in October 2022. At the time of its removal, the FATF noted that Pakistan should continue working with the Asia Pacific Group (APG) to improve its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing systems. Separately, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also recently advised Pakistan to enhance its AML/CFT effectiveness.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. The question will resolve following the conclusion of the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No jurisdictions are added to or removed from the FATF 'black list'. The list continues to consist of North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following the June 2025 plenary, the FATF announces that the list of 'High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action' remains unchanged, containing North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The FATF announces after its June 2025 plenary that a country has been added to the 'black list' (e.g., Russia) or that one of the current members (North Korea, Iran, or Myanmar) has been removed.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high degree of inertia and the significant political and technical thresholds required for any changes to the FATF 'black list'.\n\n1.  **Likelihood of Removals:** The probability of removing any of the three current black-listed jurisdictions—North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar—is extremely low. North Korea remains isolated and non-cooperative. Iran has long-standing strategic deficiencies and has not ratified key conventions. Myanmar's political situation following the 2021 military coup makes it highly improbable that it has made the 'significant progress' required for delisting.\n\n2.  **Likelihood of Additions:** The addition of a new jurisdiction is the more plausible, yet still unlikely, path to a 'Yes' resolution. \n    *   **Russia:** Despite its membership being suspended since February 2023, the FATF has refrained from adding Russia to either the grey or black list. This is a highly contentious political issue, and blacklisting Russia would have severe global financial repercussions. Without a significant new trigger, key FATF members are unlikely to reach the consensus needed for such a drastic step. The status quo of suspension has held for over two years.\n    *   **Other Jurisdictions:** Escalating a country from the 'grey list' to the 'black list' is a rare measure reserved for jurisdictions that consistently fail to implement their action plans. There is no information to suggest that any of the grey-listed countries mentioned (e.g., Nigeria, Mali) are at imminent risk of such an escalation. Similarly, while India may present new intelligence on Pakistan, a direct move from being off the lists to the black list is unprecedented and highly improbable; re-entry to the grey list would be a more likely first step.\n\n3.  **Base Rate:** Changes to the FATF black list are infrequent. The February 2025 plenary resulted in no changes, reinforcing the stability of this list. The world changes slowly, and bodies like the FATF move deliberately.\n\n**Justification of Probability:**\n*   **Why not lower than 10%:** A non-trivial probability is warranted due to the volatile geopolitical landscape. A significant escalation in the war in Ukraine or a major state-sponsored financial crime could theoretically shift the political calculus and force a consensus to blacklist Russia. The internal deliberations of the FATF are opaque, so a surprise is possible.\n*   **Why not higher than 10%:** A higher probability would suggest that a change is a real possibility. However, all available evidence points to an entrenched status quo. The bar for blacklisting is exceptionally high, and removing a country requires fundamental, verifiable regime-level changes that are not on the horizon for North Korea, Iran, or Myanmar. The powerful inertia against changing the list, especially by adding a major economy like Russia, makes 'No' the overwhelmingly likely outcome.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of a consensus building among key FATF members to blacklist Russia. I would decrease it if pre-plenary statements reinforced a focus on the grey list with no mention of potential black list changes.",
