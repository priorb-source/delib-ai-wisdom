Historically, the Conservatives have been the dominant party in Kent politics.\n\nNational polling data indicates that support for Reform UK is between 24% and 27%. Some local polls have suggested a surge in support for the party in Kent, and a number of local councillors have defected to join Reform UK.\n\nThe election uses a first-past-the-post voting system.

  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 10–12 days (election on 1 May 2025; most results expected by 2 May 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Conservatives remain the largest party on Kent County Council (possibly without an overall majority)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative vote falls sharply but remains sufficiently concentrated, with Labour/Lib Dem/Green gains spread across towns and suburbs. Reform UK wins some coastal divisions but ends up behind the Conservatives (and possibly Labour) in total seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK fields a near‑full slate and converts high national polling into concentrated pluralities across coastal and exurban divisions (Thanet, Dover, Swale, Folkestone & Hythe, parts of Gravesham/Dartford). The Conservative vote collapses and fragments, letting Reform top enough three‑ and four‑way races to become the largest party by seats.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: In 2021 the Conservatives won 57/81 seats and have historically dominated KCC. For Reform UK to finish with the most seats, the Conservatives would have to shed 30+ seats while Reform outperforms Labour/Lib Dems/Greens in a large number of single‑member FPTP divisions. The best precedent for an insurgent right‑of‑centre party is UKIP’s 17 seats in 2013; even then the Conservatives were still the largest party. That sets a high bar for Reform to clear. \n\nSeat conversion: First‑past‑the‑post at division level rewards locally concentrated strength and organisation. John Curtice’s point about Reform’s support being thinly spread matters here. Reform’s local ground game and incumbent base are limited compared to the Conservatives, Lib Dems, and Greens in Kent. Even with national polling at ~24–27%, translating that into pluralities across dozens of divisions is difficult without deep canvassing and candidate quality. \n\nKent specifics: Kent is right‑leaning, but KCC excludes Medway (a Labour stronghold), and anti‑Conservative votes can split across Labour/Lib Dem/Greens in urban and commuter areas. That fragmentation can leave the Conservatives as the largest party even with a poor vote share. Reform’s best prospects are coastal divisions (Thanet, Dover, Swale, Folkestone & Hythe), but to be the largest party they likely need 20+ wins—well above UKIP’s historic peak—and simultaneous Tory underperformance everywhere else. \n\nPolling and the KentOnline/Electoral Calculus MRP: The EC projection calling Reform to take control is a notable upside risk, but local MRP at division level is unproven and highly sensitive to modelling and candidate coverage. Given EC’s mixed track record and the lack of transparent, division‑level polling showing Reform ahead widely, I discount this as an outlier rather than a central forecast. \n\nWhy not higher: The combination of FPTP, incumbency, organisational disadvantages for Reform, and the high historical bar (UKIP max 17) make “largest party” a stretch outcome without multiple things breaking their way simultaneously. \n\nWhy not lower: National polling does place Reform high, the Conservatives are unusually weak post‑GE 2024, and Kent’s coastal areas are fertile territory. A sharp Tory collapse plus three‑ or four‑way splits could yield unexpected pluralities for Reform in low‑turnout divisions. The EC projection, while discounted, signals a non‑trivial tail risk. \n\nWhat would move me up: Evidence that Reform is running a near‑full slate of credible candidates in Kent; reliable division‑level polling or canvass data showing Reform leading in 20+ divisions; late campaign momentum specific to Kent; visible Conservative vote fragmentation in coastal areas (Tory share <20%) with Reform clearly first. \n\nWhat would move me down: Confirmation that Reform’s candidate coverage is patchy (<70% of divisions); credible polling showing Reform trailing Conservatives/Labour across Kent; signs of Conservative resilience/incumbency advantage in target divisions; organisational stumbles or low visibility for Reform’s local campaign.",
