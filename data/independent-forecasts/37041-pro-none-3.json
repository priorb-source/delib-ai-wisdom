    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Currently, no country in North America is listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current situation continues. No significant outbreak of yellow fever occurs in a North American country, and any imported cases are successfully contained without leading to sustained local transmission that would warrant a CDC travel advisory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following an increase of yellow fever cases in South America, an infected traveler introduces the virus into a region of North America with a competent mosquito vector (e.g., Mexico, a Caribbean nation, or the southern U.S.). This leads to a local transmission cycle that is detected by public health officials, prompting the CDC to issue a travel health notice for that specific country or region.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo. There have been no local outbreaks of yellow fever in North America for many decades, making the historical base rate for such an event extremely low. The public health infrastructure and vector control programs in the region are generally robust and designed to prevent the establishment of diseases like yellow fever. The provided PAHO alert, while concerning for the Americas, typically refers to endemic regions in South America. While it slightly increases the probability of imported cases into North America, the chain of events required for a 'Yes' outcome is long and improbable, especially within the short ~5-week timeframe. An imported case must arrive, bite a local Aedes aegypti mosquito, which must then survive the incubation period and bite other humans to establish a local cycle. This outbreak would then need to be detected and grow to a level sufficient to trigger a CDC advisory. Each step in this causal chain is unlikely. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 1% because the mosquito vector is present in southern parts of North America, making local transmission theoretically possible. The PAHO alert confirms heightened viral activity in the hemisphere, which slightly increases the risk of an importation event. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because of the strong historical precedent, robust public health systems, and the very short time until the resolution date, which leaves little time for a full outbreak and bureaucratic response to unfold. \n\nI would increase my forecast significantly upon hearing credible reports of confirmed *local* yellow fever transmission in any North American country. I would decrease it if PAHO reported that the outbreaks in South America were fully contained.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country in North America is listed as having a travel advisory by the Centers for Disease Control at its [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices) page when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
