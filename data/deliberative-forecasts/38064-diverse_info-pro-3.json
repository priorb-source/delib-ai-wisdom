    "review": "My initial analysis was critically flawed. I relied on historical scheduling patterns to forecast the date, a reasonable starting point but insufficient on its own. I completely failed to perform the most basic due diligence: checking for an official company announcement or the required SEC filings. Both other forecasters correctly identified this as the central issue. Forecaster 2 noted that an announcement should have been made by now, raising the first red flag. Forecaster 3's analysis was decisive, providing the specific, verifiable evidence that I missed: the lack of a DEF 14A (proxy statement) on file with the SEC. Their point about the SEC's 40-day 'Notice-and-Access' rule is a killer argument, as that deadline for a June 12 meeting has already passed. This single piece of evidence almost completely invalidates the premise that the meeting is scheduled for June 12. Their reasoning is far more convincing than my original analysis because it is grounded in regulatory requirements and current facts, not just historical extrapolation.",
    "rationale": "I am making a significant downward revision to my forecast based on the compelling evidence provided by the other forecasters. The central question is no longer whether a meeting scheduled for June 12 will be completed, but whether it is scheduled for that date at all. The evidence strongly suggests it is not.\n\nAs of May 27, 2025, GameStop has not filed its definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A). As Forecaster 3 correctly pointed out, SEC rules generally require proxy materials to be sent or made available to shareholders at least 40 days before the meeting date. With only 16 days until June 12, this deadline has been missed, making a meeting on that date under normal procedures impossible. \n\nWhile a shorter notice period (e.g., 10 days) is legally possible under specific circumstances (like forgoing 'Notice-and-Access' for full-set delivery), this would be an unconventional and rushed approach for a company of GameStop's size and profile. The probability of the company choosing this path is low.\n\nTherefore, the overwhelming likelihood is that GameStop has planned its meeting for a later date in June (e.g., June 19 or 26) for which there is still ample time to make the required filings. My initial reliance on the historical pattern was a mistake in the face of the contradictory evidence of missing regulatory paperwork. The risk has shifted from one of execution (technical failure) to one of scheduling (the date is wrong). Given that the standard procedure for a June 12 meeting has not been followed, the probability of it taking place on that date is now very small.",
