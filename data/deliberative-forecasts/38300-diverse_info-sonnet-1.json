    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I underweighted in my initial analysis. Forecaster 3's base effects argument is particularly strong: flipping from +1.49% YoY in April to negative in May requires BOTH an unusually high May 2024 base AND a significant May 2025 MoM decline - a combination that is statistically improbable. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes that the 1.488% buffer provides meaningful cushion against reversal. Both properly stress the inertia in industrial production data; major single-month reversals are rare without observable shocks. I also underappreciated that the hard data proxies showing stability (flat manufacturing hours, rail carloadings near April levels) actually support a positive outcome when combined with April's +1.49% baseline. The LEI decline and PPI weakness that concerned me are leading indicators more likely to manifest gradually over multiple months rather than immediately in May's data. However, I still believe some caution is warranted given the mixed forward-looking signals.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too conservative in my initial 78% forecast. The statistical and analytical case for maintaining positive YoY growth is stronger than I initially credited. The key insight is that moving from +1.49% in April to negative territory in May would require an unusual confluence: a strong May 2024 comparison period combined with significant May 2025 deterioration. The hard data showing stability at April levels (manufacturing hours, rail, electricity) means May would likely track close to April's performance, which would maintain positive YoY growth given the solid April baseline. My concerns about the LEI decline and PPI weakness remain valid but are more likely to signal gradual weakening over coming months rather than an immediate May reversal. The energy sector momentum and typical seasonal patterns also support May production. However, I don't think the situation warrants the 88% confidence of Forecaster 3, as the mixed indicators and global headwinds introduce meaningful uncertainty. I'm updating to 83%, which appropriately weights the strong status quo signal and statistical inertia while maintaining modest caution about the downside risks.",
