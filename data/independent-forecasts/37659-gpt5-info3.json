  "information": "The Project 2025 Tracker is a public website created by Redditors from the r/Keep_Track subreddit, with Adrienne Cobb identified as its creator. The site monitors and visually demonstrates the progress of the administration's initiatives based on the Project 2025 plan, breaking down the status of objectives by government agency. According to an April 2025 report, the tracker website was attracting between 50,000 and 100,000 visitors daily, with approximately 10% of the traffic originating from outside the United States.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days until July 1, 2025 (resolution may occur shortly after, depending on when Metaculus accesses the site on or after July 1).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "As of mid‑May, the tracker has well under 120 Done objectives (e.g., <90), and the pace of new completions slows as actions move into lengthier rulemaking and litigation phases. The maintainers apply strict criteria (e.g., proposals or partial implementations don’t count as Done), and reclassifications due to court challenges keep the total below 120 by early July.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current Done count is already close (e.g., ≥105), and a steady stream of executive actions, guidance, and agency directives pushes the tally over 120 by early July. The tracker team performs a late‑June/early‑July bulk update that logs numerous previously completed items, bringing the count to or above 120 when Metaculus checks.",
    "rationale": "Key considerations:\n- Time horizon is short. With ~6.5 weeks remaining, crossing 120 requires either already being near the threshold or a rapid surge in completions.\n- Status quo weighting: In most policy domains, especially those requiring rulemaking, the pace of fully completed items tends to slow after the first wave of executive actions. That favors a No unless the current count is already close to 120.\n- Unknown current baseline: I don’t have today’s Done count. If it’s below ~100, reaching 120 by early July is unlikely; if it’s ≥105, it’s plausible with continued activity.\n- Methodology/maintenance: The research assistant notes the site is run by the r/Keep_Track community (creator: Adrienne Cobb) and drew 50k–100k daily visitors in April, with ~10% international. High traffic suggests the tracker is actively maintained and will likely be up‑to‑date by early July, reducing the chance that the count is artificially low due to neglect. But traffic does not, by itself, increase the number of Done items.\n- Resolution nuance: Metaculus may check on or after July 1, which slightly increases the chance of a Yes if the threshold is crossed in early July.\nWhy not higher: Without knowing the current Done tally, the conservative assumption is that it’s below 120 in mid‑May. Given limited time and typical policy implementation frictions (rulemaking, litigation, interagency review), large late‑quarter jumps are uncommon unless a bulk update reflects already‑completed items.\nWhy not lower: If the administration is actively pursuing many aligned objectives and the tracker already shows 100+ Done items, only a modest additional push would be needed. Bulk updates or clustered actions in late June could plausibly tip the count over 120, and the “on or after July 1” clause offers a small timing cushion.\nWhat would move my forecast up:\n- Verified current Done count ≥105.\n- Observed pace in late May/June averaging several new Done items per week.\n- Evidence that the tracker team plans a large consolidation/bulk update of already‑met objectives.\nWhat would move my forecast down:\n- Verified current Done count <80.\n- Indications of stricter classification standards (e.g., reclassifications from Done to Paused/Blocked due to injunctions).\n- Signs the site is updating slowly or not at all through June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it is less than 120, this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Project 2025 Tracker is a public website created by Redditors from the r/Keep_Track subreddit, with Adrienne Cobb identified as its creator.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
