  "information": "Brent Metz, a 39-year-old town councilman in Mountain View, Colorado, pleaded not guilty to felony charges related to the shooting of a 17-year-old high school student in September 2024. According to investigators, Metz shot the teen in the face while the teen was sitting in his car outside Metz's home, where he had been trying to take homecoming dance pictures. A Jefferson County Sheriff’s spokesperson stated that there was no indication the teen intended to commit any crime. Metz took a leave of absence from the council after the shooting.\n\nA recall election for Brent Metz is scheduled for May 20, 2025, after a recall petition was successfully certified. The election is being conducted by mail, and ballots were sent to voters in late April 2025. Mountain View is a small town with a population of approximately 500-600 residents and fewer than 400 active voters. No public polling data on the recall election is available.\n\nHistorical data for U.S. local recall elections shows that approximately 60% of recalls that make it to the ballot succeed in removing the official. Several recent recall efforts in other small Colorado towns have been successful. In March 2025, three council members in Dillon were removed by voters in a recall election related to a development plan. In a separate 2025 case in Loveland, the targeted council member resigned from his position after a recall petition gathered sufficient signatures.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 days (election May 20, 2025; results likely same day or next).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Metz is recalled and does not retain his seat.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Mail-ballot voters in the ~500–600-person town back the recall by a clear majority, driven by the seriousness of the shooting incident and desire to avoid further reputational/legal distraction; Metz loses his seat.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Turnout is low and disproportionately composed of Metz supporters, or a late sympathy/“let the courts decide” message resonates; enough voters oppose recalls on principle or question the petitioners, so the recall fails and he retains his seat.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/base rates: Roughly 60% of U.S. local recalls that reach the ballot succeed, implying a starting point below 50% chance of retention for the incumbent. Recent Colorado small-town recalls (e.g., Dillon in March 2025) have succeeded, suggesting the local environment is not hostile to recalls.\n- Case-specific factors pushing toward recall success: The alleged conduct is unusually severe (teen shot in the face while taking photos; investigators said no criminal intent by the teen). Metz faces felony charges and took a leave of absence, both of which likely depress support. The recall petition qualified and ballots are already out, indicating sustained opponent mobilization. In very small electorates, motivated activists often dominate low-salience elections; here the salience and negative press likely motivate recall voters.\n- Countervailing factors supporting retention: No public polling; very small-N electorates are noisy. Some voters may view the recall as premature before trial, or oppose recalls on principle. Pro-gun/self-defense-leaning voters might be sympathetic. Mail elections can also produce relatively higher turnout among stable, older homeowners who may be more status-quo oriented.\n- Status quo weighting: Given the base rate (recalls succeed more often than not), severity of allegations, and recent CO examples, the status quo outcome is that the recall succeeds (Metz does not retain). I place extra weight on that absent new information.\n- Why not higher (i.e., >40% retention): The combination of serious felony charges, negative media attention, and the small-town mobilization dynamics tilts meaningfully against him; there’s no sign of exculpatory developments or broad establishment backing.\n- Why not lower (i.e., <20% retention): Small electorates produce volatility; a cohesive supporter network could swing tens of votes. Some voters may reject recall as a tool or want to await court outcomes. Mail-ballot dynamics could also narrow margins.\n- What would move me up: Credible indications of strong pro-Metz turnout/ballot return data, endorsements from respected local figures or organizations, or new evidence substantially softening public perception of the incident.\n- What would move me down: Reports of high recall-leaning turnout/returns, additional damaging revelations, or visible community/official condemnation and organization by recall advocates.",
