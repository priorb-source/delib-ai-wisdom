    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No: Colombia remains at Level 2 (Practice Enhanced Precautions) on the CDC Travel Health Notice when checked on/after June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Yellow fever and dengue activity in Colombia remain elevated but manageable; vaccination campaigns proceed; health system capacity holds; CDC keeps a Level 2 alert emphasizing prevention and vaccination, with no escalation to “Avoid Nonessential Travel.”",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid, significant deterioration occurs before June 1: confirmed widespread yellow fever (or combined yellow fever/dengue) transmission extends into major urban areas, vaccine access is constrained, case-fatality rises, and PAHO/WHO and Colombia’s MoH issue urgent advisories—prompting CDC to upgrade Colombia’s THN to Level 3 (Avoid Nonessential Travel).",
    "rationale": "I am forecasting against the explicit resolution criterion: the question resolves Yes if the CDC Travel Health Notice for Colombia is greater than Level 2 when checked on or after June 1, 2025 (i.e., Level 3 or higher). Today Colombia is at Level 2.\n\nBase rate and inertia: CDC Level 3 THNs for countrywide vector-borne outbreaks in the Americas are rare. Even during substantial dengue and yellow fever events (e.g., Brazil 2016–2018, regional dengue surges), CDC typically used Level 1–2 alerts, reserving Level 3 for severe, uncontrolled situations (Ebola/Marburg-like, or exceptional circumstances). With only ~6 weeks left, institutional inertia and update cadence also favor the status quo.\n\nCurrent signals: Media reports note yellow fever concerns and economic risk, but moving from Level 2 to Level 3 would require evidence of widespread, hard-to-mitigate risk to typical travelers, often including urban transmission and/or system strain. Yellow fever is vaccine-preventable; CDC generally emphasizes vaccination over broad travel avoidance.\n\nWhy not higher: The bar for Level 3 is high; recent history suggests CDC rarely escalates to Level 3 for vector-borne outbreaks in Latin America. Time window is short.\n\nWhy not lower: There is a non-trivial chance of rapid deterioration during peak arboviral season, including potential vaccine supply constraints or a notable surge into urban centers that triggers a policy shift.\n\nUpdate triggers upward: (1) PAHO/WHO reports of rapidly escalating confirmed yellow fever in multiple departments, including urban areas; (2) CDC Health Alert Network notices specific to Colombia; (3) evidence of vaccine shortages or major access issues; (4) Colombian MoH emergency measures indicating health system strain.\n\nUpdate triggers downward: (1) Stabilization/decline in case counts; (2) reports of successful vaccination coverage and vector control; (3) CDC updates that reaffirm or reduce the current alert level.\n\nResearch assistant info: None provided beyond links; no additional data influenced this forecast beyond general epidemiological context and CDC practice patterns.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Travel Health Notice status of Colombia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/colombia), which is \"Level 2 Practice Enhanced Precautions\" at the time of this question, is a level of greater than 2 when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
