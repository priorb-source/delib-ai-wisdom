    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize CDC precedent: Level 3 is rare for vaccine-preventable, mosquito-borne diseases like yellow fever unless there’s sustained urban transmission or clearly less‑mitigable risk. New points I hadn’t explicitly cited that I find persuasive: (1) CDC reportedly refreshed a Level 2 yellow fever notice regionally in April 2025, implying recency and policy inertia before June 1; (2) the quantified Colombia case/death figures since Sep 2024 (79/36) support that the outbreak is serious but not at a scale typical for Level 3; (3) even during large Brazil/Angola events, CDC stayed at Level 2. The short time window and ‘stickiness’ argument are strong. I don’t see counterarguments that materially raise risk beyond my prior, though the breadth of high/very‑high risk municipalities and the national emergency keep a tail risk alive if urban transmission emerges or vaccine access falters.",
    "rationale": "Resolution requires Colombia’s CDC Travel Health Notice to be >2 when checked on/after June 1, 2025. With ~5.5 weeks left, current epidemiology (rural/sylvatic focus, no confirmed urban transmission), CDC’s historical treatment of yellow fever (generally Level 2 with vaccination emphasis), and a recent April 2025 CDC Level 2 update for the region all point to low odds of escalation to Level 3 by that date. A Yes outcome would likely require rapid, documented urban transmission in a major city or clear evidence that traveler risk is not mitigable (e.g., vaccine shortages, major healthcare strain, exported cases causing policy tightening). Those would need to emerge soon and be significant enough for the CDC to override typical precedent on a countrywide basis. Conversely, the most plausible path is continued Level 2 with targeted vaccination and bite-avoidance guidance. Given the additional arguments on recent CDC updates and notice stickiness, I’m nudging my forecast slightly down from 7% to 6%.",
