  "information": "LPK1, a Renton, Washington establishment, is recalling approximately 303 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken Caesar wrap products. The recall was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, as the Caesar dressing packet contains fish (anchovies) which is not declared on the product label. The recall is designated as Class II. The affected products were produced on February 15, 17, and 19, 2025. The corresponding 'best by' dates were February 21, 23, and 25, 2025, and the lot codes were LPK1WA046, LPK1WA048, and LPK1WA050.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days. The outcome will be known on June 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The recall's current status on the USDA FSIS website is 'Active'. If this does not change by the deadline, the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administrative process, including recall effectiveness checks and final verification by the FSIS, is not completed by the end of May 2025. As a result, the recall status remains 'Active' on the USDA website on June 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "LPK1 provides all necessary documentation regarding the disposition of the recalled product, the FSIS completes its verification process, and the recall's status on the agency's website is updated to 'Closed' on or before May 31, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the typical duration of FSIS recalls and the specifics of this case. The recall was issued on February 24, 2025, and as of today, May 8, 2025, it has been active for approximately 73 days. The resolution deadline is June 1, which is 97 days after the recall was initiated. \n\nSeveral factors suggest this recall could be closed relatively quickly, arguing for a 'Yes' outcome. The quantity is small (303 pounds), the product had a very short shelf-life and expired in February (meaning it is no longer in commerce), and the distribution was limited to vending machines in one state. These factors simplify the process of ensuring the product is accounted for. \n\nHowever, the stronger evidence points towards a 'No' outcome. Historical data from the USDA suggests a median time to close a recall is approximately 120 days. For this question to resolve 'Yes', the recall would need to be closed in 97 days, which is faster than the median. The fact that the recall has already been open for 73 days without being closed indicates it is not on a particularly rapid closure track. Bureaucratic and administrative timelines are often the key bottleneck, even for straightforward cases. The status quo, where the recall is 'Active', is a strong anchor. It is more probable that the standard administrative process will continue for another 24 days than that it will conclude within that timeframe. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 35% because the simple nature of the recall (small volume, expired product) makes a faster-than-median closure plausible. I would update towards 'Yes' if I found evidence that recent, similar Class II recalls were being closed in the 75-95 day range. My forecast is not higher because the 120-day median closure time is a strong piece of evidence, and with only 24 days remaining, the status quo is likely to hold. I would update towards 'No' if I learned of any complications with LPK1's reporting to the agency.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nLPK1, a Renton, Washington establishment, is recalling approximately 303 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken Caesar wrap products.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
