  "information": "The United Nations has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, exacerbated by a blockade that severely restricts access to aid, food, water, and medical supplies. In early May 2025, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher called the aid blockade a form of 'cruel collective punishment,' noting that over 3,000 aid trucks were stalled at the border. According to OCHA reports from late April and early May 2025, insecurity and access restrictions have compelled humanitarian organizations to close nutrition centers. The same reports indicated an 80% rise in children being treated for malnutrition and that 65% of residents lack access to clean drinking water. The UN Population Fund also announced it had exhausted its supply of emergency shelter materials and hygiene products.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 57 days from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the threshold of 300 deaths would be reached",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A rapid ceasefire is achieved, UN staff are withdrawn from Gaza, or security significantly improves, resulting in fewer than 5 additional UN staff deaths over the next 57 days, keeping the total below 300",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The conflict continues at its current trajectory with UN staff remaining in dangerous operational environments. Given the ongoing humanitarian crisis and insecurity described by OCHA, 5 or more additional UN staff are killed before July 1, 2025, bringing the total to 300 or above",
    "rationale": "The question requires only 5 additional UN staff deaths to reach the 300 threshold, with 57 days remaining. The baseline of 295 deaths as of April 30, 2025, accumulated over approximately 18 months of conflict, suggests an average rate of roughly 16-17 deaths per month, or about 0.5 deaths per day. At this historical rate, we would expect approximately 30+ additional deaths by July 1, far exceeding the 5 needed. The research assistant's report from early May 2025 indicates deteriorating conditions: an aid blockade, 3,000+ trucks stalled at borders, nutrition centers closing due to insecurity, and rising malnutrition rates. These factors suggest continued dangerous operating conditions for UN personnel. The extraordinarily low threshold (needing only 5 more deaths when the historical average suggests 30+) strongly favors a Yes outcome. However, several factors prevent an even higher forecast: (1) the world changes slowly and dramatic shifts like ceasefires or mass withdrawals, while unlikely in 57 days, are possible; (2) the death rate may have declined from earlier peak periods; (3) UN operations might scale back; (4) if OCHA stops updating snapshots, the count could freeze at 295. The forecast is not higher because peace negotiations or operational changes could occur. It's not lower because the mathematical threshold is exceptionally low relative to observed trends, and current reporting suggests no improvement in security conditions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025. For example, a snapshot dated April 30, 2025, [reports](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-30-april-2025) 295 UN staff fatalities.\n\nIf OCHA stops posting new updates, this resolves as the most recent number, which as of the time of this question would be the impact snapshot posted on April 30, 2025.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe United Nations has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, exacerbated by a blockade that severely restricts access to aid, food, water, and medical supplies.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
