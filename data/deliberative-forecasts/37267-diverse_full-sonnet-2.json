    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling points I should weigh more heavily. Most notably, Forecaster 2's emphasis on 'bureaucratic and geopolitical inertia' is astute - the State Department conducted a review just two days ago (April 30), and absent a dramatic catalyst, reversing that decision so quickly would be highly unusual institutionally. Forecaster 3's mention of peer advisories (UK/Canada/EU) as confirmatory signals is a useful comparative approach I overlooked. All three of us converged on a similar range (9-12%), which itself provides some validation of the reasoning. The key shared insight is that the extremely recent review maintaining Level 3 is a very strong anchor point - the State Department explicitly decided current conditions, including known regional conflicts and the sanctions announcement, do not warrant Level 4. Both forecasters appropriately balanced this against genuine tail risks from volatile regional conflicts.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should weight the April 30 review more heavily than I initially did. The State Department made an explicit decision just 48 hours ago to maintain Level 3 status, even with full knowledge of the regional conflicts that led to the May 1 sanctions. This institutional decision strongly suggests that current baseline conditions are not seen as warranting a nationwide Level 4, and bureaucratic momentum makes rapid reversals unlikely absent extraordinary catalysts. The other forecasters correctly emphasize that my 12% may have slightly overweighted recent sanctions relative to this very recent official review. However, I don't think a dramatic adjustment is warranted - the 9-12% range represents appropriate uncertainty given volatile regional conflicts, the tail risk of rapid escalation, and the short 2-month window where a single major incident could trigger an upgrade. The base rate of 1-2% over two months for typical Level 3 countries is adjusted upward by Ethiopia's active conflicts, but the extremely recent review caps the reasonable probability. I'm adjusting down modestly to 10% to better align with the institutional inertia argument while maintaining recognition of genuine tail risks.",
