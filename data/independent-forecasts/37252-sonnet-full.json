  "information": "South Korea has been experiencing significant political instability. President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in December 2024, leading to his impeachment. The country's Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment on April 4, 2025. Following these events, a snap presidential election has been scheduled for June 3, 2025. Additionally, law enforcement authorities recently conducted a search of former President Yoon's residence as part of corruption allegations.\n\nSeveral large-scale protests have occurred in South Korea in the first half of 2025. On January 4, an estimated 35,000 people protested. On February 2, reports on participant numbers in an anti-Yoon protest ranged from 38,000 to 100,000. On February 15, a rally in Seoul demanding impeachment reportedly involved 300,000 people. On March 29, a protest demanding the president's resignation was estimated at 12,000 participants. On May 1, a Labor Day rally in Seoul organized by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) had over 8,000 participants, with police estimating attendance as high as 13,000.\n\nMultiple civic and political groups have been actively organizing demonstrations. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) and the Democratic Labor Union held rallies for Labor Day on May 1. The KCTU has also announced its intention to organize a general strike in July. Groups such as 'Free Korea' and 'Candlelight Action' have consistently held rallies and counter-rallies in response to political developments. Conservative groups have also planned a rally for May 18th in Gwangju.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (from May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - at least one protest with 10,000+ participants will be reported by the Global Protest Tracker",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The political situation stabilizes following the June 3 presidential election, reducing protest momentum. Alternatively, protests occur but fall short of 10,000 participants, or the Global Protest Tracker fails to document protests that do occur in South Korea during this period.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The upcoming June 3 presidential election generates significant protest activity, either before or after the vote. Groups like KCTU, 'Free Korea', or 'Candlelight Action' organize large demonstrations that exceed 10,000 participants, which are then documented by the Global Protest Tracker. The May 18 conservative rally in Gwangju could also meet this threshold.",
    "rationale": "South Korea has demonstrated a very strong pattern of large-scale protests in 2025, with at least four protests exceeding 10,000 participants between January and March (35,000 on Jan 4, 38,000-100,000 on Feb 2, 300,000 on Feb 15, and 12,000 on March 29). The country remains in a period of exceptional political turbulence with a snap presidential election scheduled for June 3, 2025 - exactly one month before the deadline. Multiple organized groups (KCTU, Free Korea, Candlelight Action, conservative groups) remain actively engaged in protest organizing. The May 18 Gwangju rally and potential election-related protests provide clear opportunities for 10,000+ participant events. The KCTU's Labor Day rally on May 1 reached 8,000-13,000 participants, demonstrating continued mobilization capacity. The main uncertainty is whether the Global Protest Tracker will report these events, as not all protests are captured in their database. However, given South Korea's prominence, the scale of recent protests, and the international attention on its political crisis, large protests are likely to be documented. My forecast is not higher (85-90%) because: (1) there's uncertainty about Global Protest Tracker coverage, (2) the election could potentially reduce protest activity if it's seen as legitimate, and (3) protest fatigue could set in after months of sustained demonstrations. My forecast is not lower (60-65%) because: (1) the recent pattern is extremely strong with multiple 10,000+ protests, (2) the June 3 election is a major catalyzing event, (3) organized groups have demonstrated capacity and intent, and (4) there are 61 days remaining with specific planned events. I would update higher if I saw evidence of new mass mobilizations being planned or if pre-election tensions escalate. I would update lower if the May 18 rally underperforms expectations or if there are signs of protest demobilization.",
