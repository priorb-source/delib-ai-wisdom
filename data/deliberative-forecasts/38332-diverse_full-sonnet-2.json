    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis closely aligns with my initial reasoning, viewing the scheduling conflict and three-month silence as primary negative indicators. Forecaster 3 raises several compelling points I hadn't fully weighted: (1) The Seville-to-Rio travel is actually logistically feasible with three days between events, not as prohibitive as I initially suggested; (2) Governments commonly announce head-of-state travel 1-2 weeks in advance, making late-June announcements normal rather than rushed; (3) Orsi's Frente Amplio has ideological alignment with Lula and South-South engagement, making acceptance more natural; (4) Attending as an invited guest carries minimal commitment costs compared to formal membership. However, Forecaster 3's optimism doesn't fully address why three months have passed with 'undecided' status if these positive factors are so strong. The bandwagon effect from Mexico/Colombia confirmations is speculative. I find the feasibility and timing arguments from Forecaster 3 persuasive enough to warrant an upward adjustment, but the prolonged silence remains a powerful counter-indicator that prevents me from moving as high as 46%.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too pessimistic about the logistical constraints. Three days between the Seville conference ending and the Rio summit beginning is tight but manageable for presidential travel. Forecaster 3 correctly notes that 1-2 weeks is normal timing for announcing such travel, meaning a late-June announcement would be typical rather than rushed. The ideological affinity between Orsi's center-left government and Lula's administration, combined with the low-stakes nature of attending as a guest (not joining BRICS), creates genuine political incentive. However, the three-month delay since the invitation and the 'up in the air' characterization as of early June remain significant negative signals. If attendance were straightforward, we'd expect some positive indication by now - even informal signaling. The complete absence of movement suggests either internal political divisions or strategic ambivalence about BRICS alignment. I'm updating upward based on better understanding of feasibility and timing norms, but maintaining substantial skepticism due to the observed inaction.",
