    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The government of Alberta will not announce a date for an independence referendum before July 1, 2025. The current political strategy of asserting provincial rights within Canada will continue.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The UCP government under Premier Danielle Smith continues its focus on challenging federal policies using tools like the Alberta Sovereignty Act. No major new catalysts for separation emerge, and the deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without any official announcement for such a referendum.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and severe conflict erupts between the Albertan and federal governments, for example, over a new federal environmental policy that cripples a key provincial industry. In response to what is framed as a direct attack on Alberta, Premier Smith's government makes a surprise, dramatic announcement scheduling an independence referendum to rally support and gain leverage against Ottawa.",
    "rationale": "The probability of an independence referendum being announced before July 1, 2025, is extremely low. The primary factor is the very short timeline of less than two months. Announcing an independence referendum is a monumental political act that would require significant planning, caucus consensus, and a public relations strategy, none of which is currently evident. The governing UCP's stated strategy is based on the 'Alberta Sovereignty Within a United Canada Act', which seeks to assert provincial autonomy within confederation, not to separate from it. A pivot to a referendum would represent a radical and abrupt shift from this established policy. Furthermore, there has been no significant public groundwork—such as white papers, public consultations, or sustained government messaging—to prepare the electorate for such a vote. Public support for independence is not at a level that would guarantee a victory for the 'Yes' side, making it a high-risk gamble for the current government. My forecast is not zero because of the small but non-zero possibility of a 'black swan' event—a sudden, acute crisis with the federal government that could provoke a drastic and unforeseen reaction from Premier Smith, who is known for bold political moves. However, the status quo is overwhelmingly favored. To increase my forecast, I would need to see evidence of active planning, such as leaks about a referendum bill or high-level emergency meetings focused on Alberta's place in Canada. Conversely, my forecast would move closer to zero if the Premier explicitly rules out a referendum in the near term.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
