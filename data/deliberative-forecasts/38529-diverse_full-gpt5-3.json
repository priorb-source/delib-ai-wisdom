    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core facts I used: a consistent, multi-poll double-digit Cuomo lead and a Marist RCV simulation showing him ultimately clearing 50%. Forecaster 2’s framing that overcoming a ~16-point deficit in ~2 weeks is “monumental” is a useful time-compression perspective I underweighted. Forecaster 3’s balance—acknowledging both consistent leads and the residual RCV/turnout risk—tracks my view closely. Neither added new concrete data beyond the cited polls, but they did sharpen the argument that time left meaningfully reduces the upset path. I find F2’s 88% a bit high given large undecideds, Cuomo’s polarization, and RCV uncertainty; F3’s 80% feels closer to the risk balance. Their reasoning nudges me modestly upward from my prior 77%.",
    "rationale": "Evidence still points to Cuomo as a clear favorite: multiple reputable polls from March–late May show a stable double-digit lead; Marist’s RCV simulation has him winning by round five; and his coalition (older/moderate voters, parts of Latino and Orthodox communities) tends to turn out reliably in NYC Democratic primaries. He also benefits from significant resources and targeted outreach. The two-week window makes it harder for Mamdani to erase a mid- to high-teens gap absent a shock. Countervailing risks remain non-trivial: high undecideds, a potentially energized progressive electorate (AOC endorsement), anti-Cuomo sentiment that could concentrate in later RCV rounds, and the chance of late-breaking negatives. Netting these, the deliberation reinforced that my earlier 77% was slightly conservative given time constraints and the RCV simulation. I’m raising to 80%, keeping a meaningful tail for an RCV-driven upset or turnout skew but reflecting the weight of consistent polling and coalition/turnout advantages.",
