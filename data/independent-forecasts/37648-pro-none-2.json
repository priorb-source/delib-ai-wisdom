    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new nuclear deal is announced, and the current state of heightened tensions, coupled with Iran's advancing nuclear program and existing US sanctions, continues.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite any ongoing back-channel talks, negotiators fail to overcome final sticking points regarding sanctions relief, enrichment levels, or oversight mechanisms. Domestic political opposition in both Washington and Tehran proves too strong, and one or both sides decide to wait for a more opportune moment, causing the deadline to pass without an agreement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Secret negotiations, driven by a mutual desire to de-escalate regional tensions, come to fruition. The US and Iran announce a limited, informal agreement—often termed a 'less-for-less' deal—whereby Iran freezes its high-level uranium enrichment in exchange for access to frozen assets or specific sanctions waivers. The announcement is made to stabilize the situation and build a foundation for future talks.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored by the strong tendency of the status quo to persist, especially in complex international diplomacy. The deadline of July 1, 2025, is extremely close—approximately six weeks from today. Finalizing and announcing a major international agreement in such a short timeframe is highly improbable under normal circumstances, which strongly favors a 'No' outcome.\n\nHowever, the single piece of information provided—an Israeli media report stating that senior ministers were briefed on a 'high chance' of a US-Iran agreement—is a powerful counter-signal. Israeli intelligence on this matter is generally taken seriously, and such a briefing would not likely occur without substantial evidence of advanced, secret negotiations. This suggests the groundwork for a deal may already be complete, with only the final political decision and announcement remaining. The resolution criteria are broad, allowing for a limited or informal agreement, which is more plausible on a short timeline than a comprehensive treaty like the JCPOA.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 35% because the timeline remains the single largest obstacle. Last-minute details can derail agreements, and powerful political factions in both nations are vehemently opposed to a deal. A single media report, however credible, is not enough to completely overcome the immense inertia and logistical challenges of the short deadline.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 35% because dismissing the explicit intelligence assessment shared with Israeli ministers would be a significant oversight. It implies that the behind-the-scenes probability is much higher than is publicly perceived. This signal is strong enough to substantively raise the forecast from a baseline of near-zero.\n\nI would increase my forecast with corroborating reports of diplomatic progress or statements from US/Iranian officials hinting at an impending announcement. I would decrease my forecast upon new US sanctions, aggressive Iranian regional actions, or definitive public statements from either side ruling out a near-term deal.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States and Iran announce a new nuclear deal before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nIsraeli media (Hebrew): [Senior ministers were informed: There is a high chance that the US and Iran will reach an agreement](https://www.kan.org.il/content/kan-news/politic/895178/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the US and Iran sign or announce an agreement with respect to Iran's nuclear program.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
