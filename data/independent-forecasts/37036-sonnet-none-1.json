    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Dan Osborn has not announced his candidacy yet. He is currently only 'exploring' a potential bid.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Osborn continues his exploratory phase beyond June 1st, either delaying his decision, deciding not to run, or announcing after the deadline. He may need more time for fundraising, building campaign infrastructure, or consulting with supporters before making a formal announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Osborn completes his exploratory phase within the next 5-6 weeks, secures sufficient support and resources, and formally announces his candidacy for US Senator from Nebraska before June 1, 2025. This would follow a typical timeline where exploration phases lead to announcements within a few weeks.",
    "rationale": "The Nebraska Examiner article from April 3, 2025 indicates Osborn is 'exploring' rather than actively campaigning or having announced. This exploration phase began about 3 weeks ago, giving him roughly 5.5 more weeks until the June 1 deadline. While this timeframe is sufficient for a formal announcement, the status quo heavily favors No since no announcement has been made yet. The term 'exploring' suggests he's still in an early phase of gauging viability, support, and resources. Many politicians who explore candidacies ultimately do not run, or take longer than a few weeks to make decisions. However, the public nature of his exploration shows some seriousness of intent, and midterm Senate races typically have candidates announcing 12-18 months before the election (which would be November 2026), so a June 2025 announcement would be within normal timing. Without additional information suggesting imminent announcement plans, I weight the status quo heavily. My forecast is not higher because there's no indication he's close to announcing, and exploratory phases often extend beyond initial expectations. It's not lower because the exploration itself shows real consideration, and the timeframe is reasonable for a decision. I would update higher if reports emerge of scheduled announcement events, completed fundraising preparations, or campaign staff being hired. I would update lower if reports suggest he's struggling to gain support or if the exploration phase appears to be slowing down.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Dan Osborn announce his candidacy for US Senator from Nebraska before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNebraska Examiner: [Nebraska’s Dan Osborn exploring midterm bid against U.S. Sen Pete Ricketts](https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2025/04/03/nebraskas-dan-osborn-exploring-midterm-bid-against-u-s-sen-pete-ricketts/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Dan Osborn announces his candidacy for US Senator from Nebraska before June 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
