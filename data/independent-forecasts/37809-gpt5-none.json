    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 42 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By July 1, all hitters on ESPN’s stats leaderboard are below .400 (typical leader in the .360–.395 range), so no player is listed at .400+ on the page used for resolution.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A hitter maintains an exceptional early-season run and sits at .400+ on July 1 (e.g., a high-contact, high-BABIP profile à la Arraez/Kwan), or the resolving ESPN page includes non-qualified players and at least one part-time player with limited PAs remains at or above .400.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Having a qualified hitter at .400 on July 1 is historically very rare in the modern era. Even remarkable starts (e.g., 2008 Chipper Jones, 2023 Luis Arraez) typically regress below .400 by late June. By mid-to-late May, the sample sizes are growing, and variance declines; sustaining .400 into July would require continued elite performance and luck. Status quo therefore favors No. Evidence: Recent seasons show few, if any, instances of a qualified hitter still at .400 on July 1. Nothing structural (rules, ball, run environment) in 2025 suggests a step-change that would materially increase this probability. The background article about Judge’s .400 start underscores early-season noise rather than July sustainability. Why not higher: Base rate is very low for qualified hitters; regression to the mean intensifies as PA accumulate through June. Why not lower: It’s not impossible. In 2023 Arraez hovered around .400 into late June; a single 4-for-5 or 4-for-4 on June 30 can place someone at .400 on July 1. Additionally, the resolution language could be interpreted to include non-qualified players on ESPN’s stats page. If non-qualified count, the chance that some player with limited PAs sits at .400+ on that day is much higher. Updating factors: - Up if by mid-June at least one qualified hitter is ≥ .395 (especially ≥ .400) with substantial PAs; also up if clarification indicates non-qualified players count on the ESPN page. - Down if by mid-June all leaders are ≤ .380. - Clarification swing: if explicitly “qualified hitters only,” I’d be around 7–10%; if “any player (all batters),” I’d be around 85–95%. Research assistant: No additional information provided; forecast relies on base rates, typical mid-season regression, and definitional uncertainty about ESPN page filtering.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if on July 1, 2025, any Major League Baseball player in the 2025 regular season has a batting average of greater than or equal to .400 according to the [ESPN baseball stats page](https://www.espn.com/mlb/stats)\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
