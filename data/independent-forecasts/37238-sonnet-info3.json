  "information": "At UFC 314 in Miami on April 13, 2025, Donald Trump was seen with Dana White and Elon Musk. Reports also mentioned the presence of political figures such as Kash Patel, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Kristi Noem, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio. Trump was greeted by Shaquille O'Neal and Joe Rogan, and he entered the arena to the song 'American Bad Ass' by Kid Rock, receiving a positive reaction from the crowd.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 4-7 weeks. UFC 314 occurred on April 13, 2025, and UFC events typically occur every 2-3 weeks for numbered cards. UFC 316 would likely be scheduled for late May or early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - While Trump recently attended UFC 314 and has a close relationship with Dana White, the status quo is that he does not attend every UFC event. Even with his demonstrated interest, attending consecutive numbered UFC events (314, 315, and 316) within roughly 6-8 weeks would be exceptional given presidential schedule demands.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump's presidential schedule conflicts with UFC 316, whether due to domestic policy priorities, international travel, diplomatic meetings, or other state duties. The event location may also be inconvenient, or security considerations may advise against attendance. He may simply choose to skip this particular event, as attending every UFC numbered card would be impractical.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues his pattern of attending high-profile UFC events, leveraging his friendship with Dana White. UFC 316 is scheduled at a convenient location and time, with no major scheduling conflicts. Trump values the positive public reception he receives at these events and maintains his presence in popular culture alongside his presidential duties.",
    "rationale": "Trump's recent attendance at UFC 314 on April 13, 2025, with a large entourage including cabinet members, demonstrates his continued strong interest in UFC events and close relationship with Dana White. The positive crowd reaction and his public entrance to Kid Rock's music suggests he values these appearances. However, several factors constrain the probability: (1) Presidential schedule demands - there are approximately 12-13 numbered UFC events annually, and attending all would be impractical; (2) UFC 316 is only two events after his recent attendance, making consecutive appearances less likely; (3) Without knowing the specific venue location, travel logistics are uncertain; (4) Historical patterns suggest even engaged presidents cannot maintain attendance at every event of interest. The forecast is not higher because the base rate of presidential attendance at any single UFC event should be relatively low given time constraints, even with demonstrated interest. It's not lower because Trump's very recent attendance and long-standing relationship with Dana White indicate genuine engagement, and his first term showed he prioritizes maintaining certain personal interests and public appearances.",
