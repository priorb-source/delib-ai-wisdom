  "information": "In March 2025, Anthropic raised approximately $3.5 billion in a funding round that valued the company at around $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion a year prior. Key investors in this and other recent rounds include Amazon (access to $8 billion), Google (over $3 billion invested), Lightspeed Venture Partners, Salesforce Ventures, and Fidelity Management & Research Co. Analysts have noted that the company's access to deep private funding from strategic partners lowers its immediate need for capital.\n\nAnthropic has recently launched its Claude 3.7 Sonnet model and is reportedly developing new features, including a two-way voice assistant and enhanced memory functions for its AI. The company announced a five-year, $100 million partnership with Databricks to develop corporate AI agents. Concurrently, Anthropic is expanding its operations into the Asia-Pacific region, with plans to establish an office in Korea.\n\nThe typical process for an initial public offering of this size involves preparatory steps that have not been publicly observed for Anthropic. There have been no reports or leaks to major financial news outlets like Reuters, the Wall Street Journal, or Bloomberg about the company hiring investment banks or filing a confidential S-1 form. Among U.S. venture-backed companies valued at over $10 billion (decacorns), the base rate for going public is approximately one to two companies per year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (46 days from May 15, 2025, to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Anthropic continues to operate as a well-funded private company without announcing plans for an IPO.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic continues to leverage its recent, substantial private funding from strategic partners like Amazon and Google. The company focuses on product development and international expansion, feeling no immediate pressure to raise capital publicly. The extensive preparations required for an IPO of this scale do not commence or are not completed/announced before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a surprise move, Anthropic reveals it has been secretly preparing for a public offering by confidentially filing with the SEC. Driven by a desire to capitalize on a favorable market window or to build a massive war chest amidst intense competition, the company formally announces its IPO plans via an S-1 filing or a statement on its website.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on several key factors that strongly suggest Anthropic will not announce an IPO in the next 1.5 months. \n\nFirst, the company is exceptionally well-capitalized. As noted, it raised approximately $3.5 billion in March 2025, giving it a long operational runway and reducing any immediate need for public funds. Companies typically do not pursue an IPO so soon after a major private funding round. \n\nSecond, there is a complete absence of the necessary public signals that precede an IPO of this magnitude. Major financial news outlets have not reported on Anthropic hiring investment banks or confidentially filing an S-1 form, which are standard preparatory steps. The world changes slowly, and the status quo is that Anthropic is a private company focused on R&D, not IPO logistics.\n\nThird, the base rate for technology 'decacorns' going public is very low, with only one or two per year making the transition. This suggests that for any specific company, the odds are against an IPO in a short timeframe.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 3% because the AI sector is highly dynamic and unpredictable. A sudden strategic reason, such as a major competitive move, could accelerate a pre-existing but secret IPO plan. A confidential filing could already be underway, making a sudden announcement possible, albeit unlikely.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the evidence against an imminent IPO is overwhelming. The combination of recent funding, lack of preparatory signals, and the short deadline makes a 'Yes' outcome a very low-probability event. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see credible reports from sources like Bloomberg or Reuters confirming that Anthropic has retained underwriters for an IPO.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn March 2025, Anthropic raised approximately $3.5 billion in a funding round that valued the company at around $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion a year prior.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
