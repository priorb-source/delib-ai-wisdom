    "review": "The other two forecasters identified the same core variables: the structural probability of fight cancellation and the stylistic matchup defined by Johnny Walker's immense physical advantages versus Azamat Murzakanov's undefeated record and power. All three of us agree on the paths to victory for each fighter. Forecaster 2's probability of 55% seems to under-weight the non-trivial risk of cancellation, which is a key part of the resolution criteria. Forecaster 3's analysis (44%) was methodologically strong, explicitly factoring in a 15-20% cancellation risk, which I find convincing. Their logic closely mirrored my own initial forecast. The primary point of divergence among the three of us is the quantification of Walker's conditional probability of winning, assuming the fight happens. My initial estimate was slightly more bullish on Walker's chances than Forecaster 3's, while Forecaster 2 was the most optimistic.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am making a slight upward adjustment to my forecast. My initial reasoning remains largely intact: the outcome hinges on whether the fight occurs and, if it does, whether Walker can leverage his 11-inch reach advantage. I maintain my belief that if the fight happens, Walker has approximately a 60% chance of winning due to this overwhelming physical disparity, which Murzakanov has never faced before. This is balanced by Walker's known volatility and Murzakanov's power, which gives the undefeated fighter a respectable 40% chance.\n\nThe main adjustment comes from reconsidering the probability of fight cancellation. My initial estimate of 20% was at the high end of the reasonable range suggested by Forecaster 3 (15-20%). Deliberation has convinced me to moderate this risk slightly. I am adjusting my estimated probability of the fight happening from 80% to 82.5% (i.e., a 17.5% cancellation risk). This small change reflects a slightly reduced pessimism about the structural risk, bringing my view closer to the consensus. This change is minor because no new fundamental evidence about the fighters was presented.\n\nMy updated forecast is calculated as: P(Walker Wins | Fight Happens) * P(Fight Happens) = 0.60 * 0.825 = 0.495.",
