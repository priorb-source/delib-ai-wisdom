    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable additional context. Forecaster 2 identifies a second phone call on March 18 that I wasn't aware of, strengthening the precedent for ongoing communication. More importantly, they reference a crucial Kremlin statement from April 4, 2025 explicitly stating no calls were planned for the 'near future' - we're only one month past that, making it less likely a call occurs in our window. Forecaster 3 adds useful detail about the May 5 Kremlin messaging emphasizing that 'adequate preparation' at 'various expert levels' is needed before leader engagement, suggesting any call would follow extended staff-level work rather than happening in the next 5 weeks. Both forecasters also emphasize the mutual acknowledgment requirement as an additional barrier. The independent convergence at 35% from all three of us using somewhat different evidence and reasoning paths suggests this is likely close to the true probability.",
    "rationale": "The new information both strengthens and weakens the case for a call. The March 18 call I wasn't aware of demonstrates more frequent communication than I initially thought - two calls in roughly 5 weeks (Feb 12 - March 18) shows an active communication channel. However, this is countered by three significant factors: (1) The April 4 Kremlin statement explicitly ruling out calls in the 'near future' - only one month ago, likely still applicable to our June 15 window; (2) The May 5 emphasis on needing 'adequate preparation' at expert levels suggests a deliberate, staff-driven process not conducive to a quick leader call; (3) The specificity of the mutual acknowledgment requirement adds a meaningful hurdle beyond just whether a call occurs. The status quo analysis from both forecasters is compelling - on any given day, these leaders don't speak, and our 34-day window is relatively short. The Ukraine situation remains the primary wildcard that could necessitate urgent communication, but the April statement suggests both sides feel immediate pressure has eased. My 35% forecast appropriately balances the demonstrated willingness to communicate against the explicit recent signals that near-term calls aren't planned and the high bar for such diplomatic events.",
