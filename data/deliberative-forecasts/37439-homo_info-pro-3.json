    "review": "I found the other forecasters' analyses very helpful, as they introduced crucial pieces of evidence I had not initially considered. Forecaster 2's point about two previous calls having already occurred in 2025 is an important piece of context, establishing a recent precedent for communication that weakens the 'diplomatic inertia' argument. Forecaster 3's analysis was the most impactful, citing a May 5 Kremlin statement that a meeting is 'certainly necessary'. This is a powerful, direct signal of intent that significantly alters the outlook from my initial assessment, which was based on a more neutral Kremlin statement. Forecaster 3's reasoning that this signal must be weighed against the logistical hurdles of arranging a call on a short timeline is convincing and provides a balanced perspective.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 20% was based on the premise that the status quo of no planned communication was a strong prior, and a specific catalyst would be needed to overcome diplomatic inertia. The new information provided by my peers has caused me to substantially update my view. The two key new pieces of evidence are (1) the precedent of two Putin-Trump calls already in 2025, and (2) the Kremlin's May 5 statement calling a meeting 'certainly necessary'. The first point establishes that a communication channel is active. The second, more important point, signals clear intent from the Russian side, shifting the dynamic from passive to active. This significantly increases the likelihood of a call. This Russian interest aligns with Donald Trump's known preference for leader-to-leader diplomacy. However, I am not raising my forecast above 50% due to the valid constraints raised by Forecaster 3: the need for 'adequate preparation' mentioned by the Kremlin, the short timeline, and the lack of a reciprocal public signal from Trump's team. These factors make it so the call is still more likely to not happen within this specific window. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast from 20% to 35%, reflecting a significant upward revision based on the strong new evidence of Russian intent, while still acknowledging the remaining logistical and political hurdles.",
