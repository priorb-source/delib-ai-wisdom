  "information": "As of mid-May 2025, New York Yankees player Aaron Judge's batting average was reported at various points between .402 and .423. On May 17, after a 2-for-4 game, his average reached .414, though a subsequent 0-for-5 game lowered it. By May 18, Judge had accumulated 15 home runs and 41 RBI for the season, leading the league in several offensive categories. An analysis by MLB.com noted that achieving a .414 batting average with over 15 home runs within a team's first 44 games is a rare historical feat, with parallels to seasons by Mickey Mantle in 1956 and Manny Ramirez in 2001.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "13 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Aaron Judge currently has a batting average between .410 and .414, which is above the .400 threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Judge experiences a significant slump over the next 6-8 games, hitting below .350, which would cause his batting average to drop below .400. Other players currently near .400 (if any) also decline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Judge maintains decent performance over the next 13 days, hitting around .350 or better across approximately 7 games, keeping his average at or above .400. Alternatively, another MLB player reaches .400.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome since Judge is currently batting well above .400 with only 13 days remaining until resolution. Based on approximately 170 at-bats through 44 games, rough calculations suggest Judge would need to hit around .350 or better over the next 7 games to maintain a .400+ average. This is achievable given: (1) he's been performing much better than .350 recently, (2) the timeframe is very short, and (3) he has a 10-14 point cushion above .400. However, regression to the mean is a powerful force - Judge's career average is around .280, and maintaining .400 batting averages is historically rare (last done by Ted Williams in 1941). Even elite hitters experience week-long slumps, and pitchers adjust to hot hitters. The short timeframe and current cushion make this more likely than not, but the historical difficulty of maintaining such averages prevents extreme confidence. My forecast would increase if Judge continues hitting above .400 over the next few days, or decrease if he drops below .405 before June 1.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
