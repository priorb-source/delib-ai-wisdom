    "review": "The other forecasters and I identified the same core evidence: Osborn's \"early summer\" statement, his 2024 campaign announcement timeline, the recent formation of his exploratory committee, and the political pressure from incumbent Pete Ricketts. We all agree 'No' is the more likely outcome. However, their analyses, particularly Forecaster 3's, convinced me that my original forecast was too high. Forecaster 3 introduced two crucial points I had overlooked: 1) as an independent, Osborn faces no primary filing deadline, removing a key structural pressure for an early announcement, and 2) a longer exploratory period allows him to gauge support from national groups like the DSCC, which is critical for viability against a wealthy opponent. These arguments provide a strong strategic rationale for a more patient approach, making a post-June 1 announcement more likely than I had initially assessed.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 40% to 30%. My initial analysis was heavily weighted toward the strategic necessity for Osborn to announce early to counter the well-funded incumbent, Pete Ricketts, who has already secured Donald Trump's endorsement. I viewed this as a powerful incentive to break from a conventional timeline and start fundraising immediately. While this pressure remains a significant factor and keeps the probability of a 'Yes' outcome non-trivial, the deliberation process highlighted stronger arguments for a later announcement. Forecaster 3's argument that, as an independent, Osborn lacks the structural pressure of a primary filing deadline is particularly compelling. Furthermore, the point that he needs time to secure commitments and assess financial viability with national partners before launching a demanding campaign is a powerful reason to extend the exploratory phase. This aligns better with historical precedent, including Osborn's own 2024 campaign timeline (July announcement) and the typical 3-6 month duration for exploratory committees. His public statement that he will \"decide by early summer\" is most naturally interpreted as June or July, not May. Therefore, I believe a more deliberate timeline is the more probable course of action, and I have adjusted my forecast to reflect this.",
