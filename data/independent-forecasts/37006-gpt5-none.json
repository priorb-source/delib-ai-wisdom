    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 months (election expected by Oct 20, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. In 2021 the Bloc Québécois won 32 Quebec seats vs 10 for the Conservatives, and Bloc support is typically more efficiently distributed across francophone ridings than Conservative support.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Conservatives sustain a broad Quebec surge beyond the Quebec City/Chaudière‑Appalaches corridor, flipping multiple francophone ridings across Saguenay–Lac‑Saint‑Jean, Mauricie, Lanaudière, and the Eastern Townships, while the Bloc simultaneously collapses (e.g., due to a strong Liberal leadership change that pulls soft‑nationalist voters away). CPC clears ~20+ Quebec seats while the Bloc falls below that.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Bloc holds its francophone base outside Montreal and maintains efficient vote splits, limiting CPC gains mainly to Quebec City and a handful of rural strongholds. Even if Liberals rebound or a new Liberal leader emerges, most of those gains come at the Bloc’s expense in and around Montreal rather than boosting the Conservatives, leaving the Bloc still ahead of CPC in Quebec seat count.",
    "rationale": "Baseline matters: in 2021 the Bloc beat the Conservatives in Quebec by 32–10 seats. Under first‑past‑the‑post, the Bloc’s vote is typically more efficiently distributed across francophone regions, whereas Conservative strength is concentrated in the Quebec City area and a limited set of ridings (Beauce/Chaudière‑Appalaches, Portneuf–Jacques‑Cartier, Louis‑Saint‑Laurent, etc.). Even with national Conservative momentum, translating Quebec‑wide vote share into two dozen seats is a high bar without a broad francophone shift. As of late 2024, public polling often showed CPC gains in Quebec, but not a consistent province‑wide dominance. Meanwhile, provincial dynamics (PQ resurgence, CAQ softness) tend to bolster sovereigntist sentiment and can stabilize Bloc support in many regions. Also, riding‑level frictions matter: candidate eligibility or nomination issues in key Quebec City ridings can cost the CPC marginal seats, as suggested by the reported case where a Conservative candidate couldn’t run and the Bloc benefitted. What could flip this? A pronounced and sustained CPC lead among francophone voters (not just in Quebec City), visible in reputable Quebec‑only polling; high‑profile CPC recruits in target Bloc ridings; or a Liberal leadership change (e.g., to a popular Quebec‑friendly leader) that drastically reshapes the field by splitting the Bloc vote while leaving CPC competitive in three‑way races. Why not higher than my estimate? Because CPC momentum and a potential Liberal leadership reset create real downside risk for the Bloc’s seat tally; in a three‑way contest, localized swings can flip many seats. Why not lower? Because the Bloc’s starting advantage, vote efficiency, and the limited universe of currently competitive CPC ridings make it more likely than not that the Bloc still finishes ahead of the Conservatives in Quebec seats absent a clear, sustained province‑wide realignment. I would update upward if: francophone‑only polling shows Bloc resilience (mid‑ to high‑20s or better) and CPC stalled outside Quebec City; Bloc lands strong local candidates/incumbent protections in key marginals. I would update downward if: CPC posts a consistent 5–10 point lead among francophones across multiple pollsters, secures star candidates in Bloc‑held ridings, or a new Liberal leader meaningfully reduces the Bloc’s floor without materially hurting CPC competitiveness.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
