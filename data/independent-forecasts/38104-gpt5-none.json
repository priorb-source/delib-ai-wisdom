    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — at least one escapee remains at large past July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite multiple arrests, one or more of the remaining escapees leaves the New Orleans area or relies on local networks to avoid detection. Leads dry up, and the last holdout(s) are not located before July 1, creating a long tail to the manhunt.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Multi-agency efforts (Sheriff’s Office, US Marshals, State Police) generate tips and surveillance hits that cascade into arrests. By mid-to-late June, the final one or two escapees are tracked down during targeted operations, or one is killed during an encounter, allowing officials to confirm that all ten have been recaptured or deceased before July 1.",
    "rationale": "a) Time left: About 32 days remain.\nb) Status quo: As of May 19, media reported 7 of 10 were still at large. With a large group escape, it is common that several are caught quickly and one or more prove elusive. If nothing changes materially, the default is that at least one remains uncaught by the deadline, implying No.\nc/d) Scenarios: A No outcome only requires one person to evade capture; a Yes outcome requires a clean sweep of all remaining escapees within the next month. Even if most are caught, the last holdout often drives the tail risk for timelines like this.\nEvidence/Reasoning:\n- Base rates: In multi-person jailbreaks, early recaptures are common; the hazard of capture declines for those not caught in the first days. After two weeks, remaining fugitives often take longer to find. Requiring all 10 to be in custody (or confirmed deceased) by a fixed near-term date is a high bar.\n- Timeline: We are already two weeks post-escape; the problem shifts from quick roundups to targeted manhunts. With 32 days left, capturing every last individual is doable but not the modal outcome.\n- Correlation: While arrests can be correlated (one lead can net multiple captures), the final outstanding fugitive often benefits from the experience of earlier arrests (learning effect) or relocates beyond the initial search perimeter.\nWhy not higher? Because the event requires perfection (all 10), and the last fugitive routinely extends timelines beyond a month in high-profile escapes. As of the last known report, a majority were still at large.\nWhy not lower? Public and political pressure, plus involvement of US Marshals and state resources, increases the capture rate. If recent days have already reduced the at-large count, the remaining set might be small enough to close out by July 1.\nUpdates that would move me up: Credible reports that only one or two remain at large; concrete leads placing remaining fugitives in known locations; arrests occurring in rapid succession; or confirmation that a remaining fugitive is deceased.\nUpdates that would move me down: Reports that several are still missing with few leads; indications that one or more have left the state or have strong support networks; investigative setbacks or legal constraints limiting searches.\nResearch assistant summary: No additional information was provided beyond the background link; therefore, this forecast leans on general timing/base-rate reasoning and the last publicized count (7 at large as of May 19).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in the [2025 New Orleans jailbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Orleans_jailbreak) have been either recaptured or killed, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions). If any are still at large on July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
