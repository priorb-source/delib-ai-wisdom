  "information": "Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service after posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to spell '86 47'. The number '86' can be slang for 'kill' or 'remove,' and Donald Trump is the 47th president. Following the post, Comey was interviewed by the Secret Service but was not arrested. He later deleted the post, stating, 'I didn't realize that some people associate these numbers with violence. I oppose all forms of violence, so I deleted the post.' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the investigation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No arrest - Comey was interviewed by Secret Service but released without charges",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The investigation concludes without finding sufficient evidence of criminal intent to threaten the President. First Amendment protections and Comey's stated innocent explanation prevent prosecutors from establishing probable cause. The case remains under review but no arrest occurs before July 1st.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Federal authorities determine they have probable cause to arrest Comey on charges related to threatening a federal official. New evidence emerges showing intent, or prosecutors decide the '86 47' post meets the legal standard for a 'true threat' despite First Amendment concerns. Alternatively, unrelated charges emerge from the investigation.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors no arrest. Comey has already been interviewed by the Secret Service and was not arrested at that time - this is significant evidence that authorities did not find immediate probable cause. With only 32 days remaining, the timeframe is very compressed. For arrest to occur, several things must happen: (1) prosecutors must conclude the Instagram post constitutes a prosecutable threat despite First Amendment protections, (2) they must overcome Comey's stated innocent explanation that he didn't realize the association, and (3) they must act quickly. The legal bar for arresting someone over symbolic or ambiguous speech is high - 'true threats' require intent and must be taken as threatening by a reasonable person. Comey's deletion and clarification make proving intent difficult. The base rate for arrests of high-profile former officials over social media posts is extremely low. However, the probability is not negligible because: the investigation is active and confirmed by DHS Secretary Noem, the political environment may favor aggressive action, and we cannot rule out additional evidence or charges emerging. The fact that this involves the current administration and a controversial former FBI Director adds unpredictability. My forecast would increase if: new evidence of intent emerged, if charges were filed, or if there were reports of imminent arrest. It would decrease if: the investigation were closed, if legal experts indicated the speech was clearly protected, or if more time passed without action.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFormer FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service after posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to spell '86 47'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
