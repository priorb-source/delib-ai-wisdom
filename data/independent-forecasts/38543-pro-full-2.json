  "information": "Following a phone call between the two leaders, Donald Trump stated that Xi Jinping had invited him to visit China, an invitation he accepted. Trump also extended a reciprocal invitation for Xi to visit the US. On June 11, 2025, Trump posted on social media that he and Xi had agreed to meet in person, with the date and location to be announced later. The official statement from the Chinese government mentioned that Trump was invited to visit China but did not mention Xi accepting an invitation to visit the US. In March 2025, Trump had announced that Xi would visit Washington in the 'not too distant future,' without specifying a date.\n\nUS-China trade talks resumed in London on June 9, 2025, with a US delegation that included the Treasury Secretary, Commerce Secretary, and Trade Representative. On June 11, Trump announced that a US-China trade agreement was finalized. Chinese officials characterized the outcome as a 'framework agreement.' A White House official stated that the agreement, which is subject to final approval from both leaders, allows the US to impose a 55% tariff on Chinese imports, while China would impose a 10% tariff on US imports. A 90-day pause on tariffs is set to expire on July 9, 2025, with new tariffs scheduled to take effect on July 8.\n\nDonald Trump's confirmed upcoming international travel includes the G7 Summit in Canada from June 16-18, 2025, and the NATO Summit in the Netherlands from June 24-25, 2025. Chinese President Xi Jinping is scheduled to be in Central Asia for a summit in Kazakhstan from June 16-18, 2025. Historically, US presidential visits to China involve extensive logistical and security preparations, typically beginning weeks or months in advance. As of mid-June 2025, there have been no public reports of advance teams being dispatched or security preparations being made for a potential visit by Trump to China.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days (from June 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Donald Trump will not visit China. While an invitation has been accepted in principle, the extremely short timeframe, conflicting international schedules for both leaders, and the complete lack of any reported logistical or security preparations make a visit before July 1, 2025, highly improbable.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Given the logistical complexities of a presidential visit to China and the leaders' packed schedules for late June, both sides decide to schedule their meeting for a later date, likely in July or August, to allow for proper planning and to finalize the details of the new trade framework. No visit occurs before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seeking a significant diplomatic victory and aiming to finalize the trade agreement in person before new tariffs take effect, Donald Trump arranges a rapid, short-notice working visit to China during the brief window between his G7 and NATO summit trips (approximately June 19-23). The visit is unconventional and lacks the typical pomp and circumstance, focusing squarely on the trade deal.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is a very low 2%. The primary driver for this assessment is the overwhelming logistical improbability of organizing a US presidential visit to China in the 16 days remaining before the deadline. Presidential trips of this nature are major undertakings requiring weeks, if not months, of advance planning by diplomatic, security, and logistics teams. The research indicates no such preparations are underway. Furthermore, both President Trump and President Xi have confirmed international travel commitments in mid-to-late June (G7/NATO for Trump, a summit in Kazakhstan for Xi), leaving only a very narrow and impractical window for a visit. While Trump has accepted an invitation and a trade framework is in place, the announcement that a date and location are 'to be announced later' strongly suggests the meeting is not imminent. The status quo, defined by logistical constraints and existing schedules, heavily favors a 'No' outcome. My forecast is not 0% solely to account for Donald Trump's known affinity for unconventional, surprise diplomatic maneuvers, though the practical barriers make such an event extremely unlikely. The probability is not higher because there is a complete absence of the necessary prerequisite actions for such a visit. I would increase my forecast significantly upon any credible report of a US advance team arriving in China or a public statement specifying a visit date before July 1. Conversely, as each day passes without such news, the probability will trend closer to zero.",
