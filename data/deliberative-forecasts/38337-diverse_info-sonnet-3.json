    "review": "Both forecasters provide crucial information I lacked: actual current baseline data. Forecaster 3's specific figures are most valuable - latest claims at 247k (May 31), prior week 239k, and 4-week moving average ~235k. This fundamentally changes the analysis. The baseline is ALREADY 15k+ above the 220k threshold, not near it as I speculated. Forecaster 2 confirms this elevated baseline around 220-230k. Both correctly identify that the question thus becomes whether claims will DROP significantly (~15k+ from the moving average) rather than RISE to exceed the threshold. Forecaster 3's point about typical 5-10k weekly volatility is important - a 15k+ drop would be larger than normal. Forecaster 2's mention of state-level decreases provides a counterpoint but doesn't override the strong aggregate trend. Their forecasts (65% and 76%) are both substantially higher than my 58%, and appropriately so given the data.",
    "rationale": "My initial 58% forecast was significantly too low due to my acknowledged lack of current baseline data. Now knowing that: (1) the most recent reading is 247k - already 27k ABOVE the threshold, (2) the 4-week moving average is ~235k - 15k above threshold, (3) typical weekly volatility is 5-10k, and (4) the broader trend is upward with continuing claims at elevated levels, the probability calculus changes dramatically. For the outcome to be 'No' (≤220k), we'd need claims to drop by 15k+ from the moving average within 2 weeks - this would be an unusually large favorable move against the current upward trend. The convergence of hard data (247k latest print), forward indicators (layoff announcements, weak hiring), and structural indicators (continuing claims at 1.9m) all point toward sustained elevation above 220k. While weekly noise and potential mean reversion prevent extreme confidence, the evidence strongly favors a 'Yes' outcome. I'm updating from 58% to 73% - lower than Forecaster 3's 76% to account for volatility and potential seasonal factors, but substantially higher than my initial forecast to reflect the reality that we're starting well above the threshold.",
