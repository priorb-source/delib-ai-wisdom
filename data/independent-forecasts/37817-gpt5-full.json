  "information": "United Airlines has announced a new year-round, twice-weekly direct flight from Narita, Japan, to Koror, Palau, which will commence on October 29, 2025. The route will be operated by a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, and tickets are already available for purchase. Separately, in February 2025, Qantas launched a new direct route from Brisbane to Koror, named the 'Palau Paradise Express.' This service is supported by the Australian Government.\n\nAs of early 2024, there were four to five regularly scheduled direct flight destinations from Koror, including Guam (operated by United Airlines), Manila (United Airlines), Taipei (China Airlines), and Brisbane (Qantas). In addition to scheduled services, Japan Airlines (JAL) resumed direct charter flights from Narita to Palau in March 2025 after a five-year suspension.\n\nTourism in Palau is in a recovery phase. Visitor numbers from Europe reached 3,442 by December 2024, approaching pre-pandemic levels. The Palau Visitors Authority is promoting the destination by leveraging increased flight frequency with partners like China Airlines. Hong Kong Airlines also lists Koror as a destination within its network. Prior to the pandemic, several South Korean airlines, including Air Seoul and T'way, operated services to Palau. A previous service between Narita and Koror operated by Delta Air Lines was suspended in May 2018.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — current scheduled nonstop destinations from Koror appear to be around 3–5, not 6+",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By July 1, FlightsFrom lists only Guam (United), Taipei (China Airlines), and a mix of Manila and/or Yap (United) — possibly plus Brisbane if it exists — totaling 5 or fewer. Japan remains charters only; South Korea service is not reinstated; the announced United Narita route starts after October and doesn’t count.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least two additional scheduled routes are active and listed by July 1 (e.g., Brisbane turns out to be a scheduled service and is listed, and at least one of Seoul or Hong Kong is operating as scheduled service; plus Guam/Taipei/Manila/Yap are all listed), bringing Koror’s nonstop destinations to 6 or more.",
    "rationale": "- Definition matters: This resolves using the FlightsFrom ROR page on/after July 1, 2025 and counts scheduled nonstops only. Series charters typically don’t appear; ad-hoc charters won’t count. Timing also matters: routes starting after July 1 (e.g., United NRT announced for Oct 29, 2025) won’t help.\n- Current picture (as best inferred without fresh scraping): ROR reliably has Guam (United) and Taipei (China Airlines). Manila (United) and Yap (United) have existed historically but have been inconsistent post‑pandemic; either/both may be present. That suggests 3–4, occasionally 5 destinations listed.\n- Research assistant info I’m using but treating cautiously: (1) JAL charters from Narita resumed in Mar 2025 — likely not counted. (2) A claimed Qantas Brisbane–Koror launch in Feb 2025 — this is atypical for Qantas and more consistent with a subsidized Nauru Airlines–style service; even if Brisbane is real and listed, we still need 5 other destinations to exceed 5. (3) United’s NRT–ROR in Oct 2025 — too late for this question.\n- Demand and lead times: Palau tourism remains below pre‑pandemic levels; PRC group travel remains constrained due to Palau–Taiwan ties; South Korean demand has lagged with travelers choosing other destinations. New scheduled routes typically have months of lead time and public announcement; with ~6 weeks left, the window for additional newly listed services before July 1 is narrow.\n- What would raise my forecast: Confirmed, scheduled (not charter) services appearing on airline/GDS timetables to be operating by July 1, especially (a) a verified Brisbane listing on FlightsFrom, plus (b) at least one of Seoul or Hong Kong, and (c) confirmation that both Manila and Yap are active scheduled destinations. Any two of those three would likely push the count to 6+.\n- What would lower my forecast: Evidence that Manila and/or Yap are not currently scheduled, or that the Brisbane claim is a charter/seasonal later start and not listed by July 1. Given the short runway and weak demand indicators, the base case is 5 or fewer.\n- Why not higher: Reaching >5 requires six or more scheduled destinations; given current known services and the need for multiple additions by July 1, that’s unlikely. \n- Why not lower: There is some chance that both Manila and Yap are listed, and that Brisbane is indeed a scheduled service; with one more addition (e.g., Seoul) it could tip over, though this stack of positives is improbable within the time left.",
