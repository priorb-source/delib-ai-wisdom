  "information": "According to media reports citing the Kremlin, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin held phone conversations on February 12, 2025, and March 18, 2025. The February call reportedly lasted nearly 90 minutes. The March call was to discuss the war in Ukraine and a potential 30-day ceasefire proposal. On April 4, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that no phone conversations between the leaders were planned for the near future.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that a meeting between Putin and Trump is 'certainly necessary' and 'on everyone's lips.' However, Peskov emphasized that any such meeting requires 'adequate preparation' at 'various expert levels' and that, as of that date, there were no specific details or a set date.\n\nDonald Trump is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates in mid-May 2025 to participate in a Gulf summit. In late April, Trump mentioned the possibility of a meeting with Putin during this trip. On May 5, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Putin's schedule does not currently include a trip to the Middle East.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be determined by June 15, 2025, which is 40 days from today's date of May 6, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Based on the most recent public statements from the Kremlin, no high-level contact is planned for the near future as significant preparation is required.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Diplomatic groundwork for a potential future in-person meeting proceeds slowly through lower-level channels. No urgent geopolitical crisis emerges that necessitates a direct call between the two leaders before mid-June. They decide to forgo a phone call in favor of a more substantive, face-to-face meeting later in the year, and the deadline of June 15, 2025, passes without a call taking place.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East, a new development, such as a concrete proposal regarding the war in Ukraine, creates an urgent need for direct discussion. Finding an in-person meeting logistically impossible on short notice, the two leaders opt for a direct phone call in early June to discuss the proposal and maintain diplomatic momentum.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 30% leans towards a 'No' outcome, primarily driven by the current status quo. The Kremlin's most recent statements explicitly temper expectations for any near-term leader-level contact. Spokesperson Dmitry Peskov's comments on May 5, while calling a meeting 'necessary,' emphasized that it requires 'adequate preparation' and that 'no specific details or a set date' exist. This signals that the next interaction is being framed as a significant, well-prepared event, likely an in-person meeting, rather than an ad-hoc phone call. The short, 34-day resolution window from May 12 to June 15 further supports this, as diplomatic scheduling for such high-level contact often takes more time.\n\nHowever, my forecast is not lower than 30% due to several key factors. First, there is a clear precedent for communication; the leaders have already spoken twice in 2025 (February and March) to discuss substantive issues, indicating an open and active channel. Second, a phone call is a much lower logistical hurdle than a full summit, making it a viable option if a pressing issue arises. The world situation remains volatile, and an unforeseen crisis could easily necessitate an urgent call, overriding any previously stated plans about 'preparation.'\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 30% because the official guidance from the Kremlin is the most concrete evidence available, and it points away from imminent contact. Peskov's comments on May 5, coupled with his April 4 statement that no calls were planned, create a pattern of dampening near-term expectations. To justify a higher probability, I would need to see new evidence, such as statements from either the Trump campaign or the Kremlin hinting at a scheduled call, or the emergence of a major international crisis that would logically require their direct intervention.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
