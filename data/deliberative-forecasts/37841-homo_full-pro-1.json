    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the key dynamics of this question, with forecasts in a narrow 35-40% range. We all correctly identify the central conflict: Glastonbury's counter-cultural history of resisting pressure versus the extraordinary legal and security risks posed by a band member facing a charge under the Terrorism Act. Forecaster 2 provided a particularly valuable framing that I hadn't explicitly articulated: the charge gives Glastonbury a 'legally-grounded justification' for cancellation. This allows the festival to sidestep a purely ideological/free-speech debate and instead frame a potential cancellation as a pragmatic response to legal advice and security concerns. This insight actually strengthens the argument for a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 35%. The deliberation with the other forecasters has reinforced my initial analysis rather than changing it. The consensus is that a cancellation is more likely than not. The key argument raised by Forecaster 2—that the terrorism charge provides Glastonbury with a defensible, non-political 'out'—makes a cancellation decision easier and therefore more probable. This compelling point solidifies my view that the 'Yes' outcome is unlikely, and it counters any temptation to raise my probability towards Forecaster 2's 40%. I believe the gravity of a terrorism charge, the precedent of other cancellations, and the intense political pressure create a situation where the reputational, security, and legal risks for the festival organizers overwhelmingly favor cancellation. My forecast remains at 35% because Glastonbury's unique history of defiance cannot be entirely dismissed, and they have not cancelled yet, but the path to a performance has become exceptionally narrow.",
