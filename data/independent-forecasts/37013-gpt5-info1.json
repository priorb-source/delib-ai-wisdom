  "information": "The composition of the Cornwall Council prior to the 2025 election consisted of 44 seats for the Conservatives, 13 for the Liberal Democrats, 4 for Labour, 1 for Reform UK, and 1 for the Greens, with the remainder held by others or independents. This represents a 31-seat lead for the Conservatives over the Liberal Democrats. Historically, the Liberal Democrats have never been the largest party on the Cornwall Council.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Around 2 weeks (election expected in early May 2025; results typically within 24–48 hours).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the Conservatives remain the largest party by seats, with Independents and others splitting the anti-Conservative vote.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives lose seats but still finish first; or Independents emerge as the largest bloc; or Labour outpaces the Liberal Democrats in key towns while Independents retain rural seats, leaving the Lib Dems short of first place.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative vote collapses across Cornwall, the Liberal Democrats run a full slate and convert many second places into wins, Labour’s gains remain concentrated in a handful of urban divisions, Independents underperform relative to 2021, and tactical voting plus local incumbency delivers the Lib Dems the highest seat total (even without a majority).",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and history: Per the research assistant, pre-election composition is roughly Conservatives 44, Liberal Democrats 13, Labour 4, Reform 1, Greens 1, with the rest Independents/others. That implies about a 31-seat gap to the Conservatives. In the unitary Cornwall Council era (since 2009), the Liberal Democrats have not been the largest party; Independents or Conservatives usually are. The status quo therefore favors a No outcome.\n- Path to Yes exists but is demanding: A national Conservative slump and Liberal Democrat revival in the South West are real tailwinds. The Lib Dems have performed strongly in recent local cycles across southern England and could capitalize on anti-Conservative tactical voting. However, Cornwall’s politics feature strong Independents and localized patterns (including Mebyon Kernow), which tend to fragment the non-Conservative vote and make it harder for any single opposition party to be the largest.\n- Seat arithmetic: To be largest in an 87-seat council, the Lib Dems likely need on the order of mid-20s to low-30s seats, depending on how fragmented others are. That would mean gains of roughly 12–20+ seats from their current 13. This is possible in a wave, but simultaneously the Conservatives would need to drop below that threshold and Independents/Labour would need to underperform relative to the Lib Dems across many divisions.\n- Why not higher: The combination of a large starting deficit, historically strong Independents, and Labour’s potential in specific towns (splitting anti-Tory votes) makes it hard for the Lib Dems to finish first on seat count.\n- Why not lower: The national environment is unusually adverse for Conservatives, and the Lib Dems’ South West brand plus ground game could deliver disproportionate seat gains from second-place positions, especially if they field a full slate and benefit from tactical voting.\n- What would move me up: Evidence that the Lib Dems are contesting nearly all divisions; clear signs of tactical-vote coordination or public endorsements from Greens/Labour figures; multiple strong Lib Dem by-election swings in Cornwall since 2021; credible local polling or ward-level canvass data showing Lib Dem leads versus fragmented opposition; reports of Conservative retirements/defections in key divisions.\n- What would move me down: Incomplete Lib Dem candidate coverage; strong Independent slates in many rural divisions; indications Labour is highly competitive across multiple Cornish towns (splitting anti-Tory vote widely); Conservative incumbents running again with robust local profiles; lack of Lib Dem momentum in Cornish by-elections.\nGiven the heavy weight I put on the status quo and historical patterns in Cornwall, tempered by the unusually favorable national climate for Lib Dem gains, I assign a modest but non-trivial chance that the Liberal Democrats finish as the largest party.",
