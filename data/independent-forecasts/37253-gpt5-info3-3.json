  "information": "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has repeatedly called for strengthening the country's strategic forces. Following the destroyer weapon tests in April 2025, he stated, 'The time has come for North Korea's navy to choose to accelerate nuclear armament.' In January 2025, he said the country's nuclear weapons development program would continue 'indefinitely.' In February 2025, the US, South Korea, and Japan issued a joint statement confirming their trilateral partnership and calling for North Korea's complete nuclear disarmament, pledging to strengthen sanctions enforcement. The European Union condemned North Korea's ballistic missile launch in January 2025, calling it a violation of UN Security Council resolutions.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "North Korea continues missile and other weapons demonstrations and sharp rhetoric but refrains from an underground nuclear detonation; there are no clear, widely reported pre-test indicators at Punggye-ri; Beijing and/or Moscow signal a preference for avoiding a headline-grabbing nuclear test ahead of key diplomatic or economic considerations; Pyongyang calculates that ongoing missile advances and conventional provocations suffice without incurring the added costs of a nuclear test.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "North Korea conducts a seventh underground nuclear test at Punggye-ri—likely to validate a smaller tactical warhead or an upgraded thermonuclear design—timed to domestic propaganda needs or as a coercive signal in response to US–ROK–Japan moves. The CTBTO International Monitoring System detects a clear seismic event consistent with a nuclear explosion, and this is corroborated by governments and reflected in sources cited by Wikipedia.",
    "rationale": "- Base rate and status quo: The last DPRK nuclear test was in 2017. Despite frequent forecasts of an imminent seventh test since 2022 and apparent site readiness, none has occurred. The default (no test) has held for over seven years, and there are only about two months left in this question’s window. This argues for a relatively low probability.\n- Current signals: The research assistant notes escalatory rhetoric from Kim about accelerating nuclear armament (Jan and Apr 2025) and continued missile activity, along with stronger trilateral US–ROK–Japan coordination and EU condemnations. These indicate tension and capability development but are not, by themselves, reliable short-term predictors of a nuclear test. Typical pre-test indicators (e.g., specific satellite-observed activity at Punggye-ri like sustained tunneling logistics, water discharge/pumping, notable vehicle/personnel upticks, or evacuation patterns) have not been cited here.\n- Incentives and constraints: A nuclear test would have major diplomatic costs and could invite additional sanctions; historically, China’s calculus often weighs against such tests unless Pyongyang deems the benefits compelling. That said, closer DPRK–Russia ties and weaker UN enforcement since 2024 may marginally reduce the expected penalty, nudging risk upward.\n- Why not higher: Lack of concrete, near-term indicators; the short remaining window; no obvious catalytic event on the calendar before July 1 that Pyongyang typically aligns with such tests. The status quo has been stable.\n- Why not lower: Rhetorical emphasis on accelerating nuclear armament; continued missile progress that could motivate a validating nuclear detonation; long-reported readiness of Punggye-ri’s Tunnel 3 suggests the test could occur on short notice if leadership decides.\n- What would move me up: Credible satellite imagery or OSINT showing renewed, sustained activity at Punggye-ri consistent with imminent testing; evacuation notices near the site; CTBTO or national technical means detecting unusual precursory seismicity; strong propaganda build-up in DPRK state media; a sharp crisis with the US–ROK–Japan bloc.\n- What would move me down: Credible reporting indicating the site is not currently in test-ready condition; signals of Chinese pressure and DPRK responsiveness; a shift of regime messaging toward other priorities (e.g., satellites, naval platforms) without nuclear references over the next few weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill North Korea test a nuclear weapon before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and in 2017.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting such as the [International Monitoring System’s ](https://www.ctbto.org/our-work/detecting-nuclear-tests) and the sources cited at Wikipedia's [List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has repeatedly called for strengthening the country's strategic forces.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
