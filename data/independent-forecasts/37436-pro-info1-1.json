  "information": "As of April 30, 2025, the official UN OCHA impact snapshot reported 295 UN staff fatalities in Gaza. Reports from late April cited UNRWA stating that 295 of its personnel had died since October 7, 2023. This number reflects a steady increase over time; a UN report on March 19, 2025, had stated at least 280 UN employees were killed, and an OCHA report cited on January 9, 2025, listed 263 UNRWA staff fatalities. Broader figures for humanitarian workers indicate a higher total toll; an OCHA report on April 23, 2025, stated that at least 418 humanitarian workers, including the 295 UN staff, had been killed in Gaza since the conflict began. A specific incident on March 23, 2025, resulted in the deaths of 15 humanitarian personnel, including staff from the Palestinian Red Crescent and one UN staff member.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months. The resolution date is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current rate of UN staff fatalities, if it continues, would push the total well over 300 before the resolution date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome occurs if fewer than five additional UN staff deaths are reported by the deadline. This would most likely happen if a comprehensive and lasting ceasefire is implemented immediately and holds, or if OCHA stops publishing new impact snapshots, in which case the last reported number (295) would be used for resolution.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome occurs if the conflict continues at a similar intensity to previous months. The established rate of UN staff casualties would lead to at least five more reported deaths, pushing the total to 300 or more before July 1, 2025. A major military escalation in southern Gaza would make this outcome even more certain.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is based on the current data and recent trends. As of April 30, 2025, OCHA reported 295 UN staff killed. The threshold for a 'Yes' outcome is 300, meaning only 5 more reported fatalities are needed before July 1, 2025. My research assistant's report indicates that between March 19 and April 30 (a 42-day period), the number of reported deaths increased by 15, an average of about 0.36 deaths per day. At this rate, the threshold of 300 would be surpassed in approximately two weeks, well before the July 1 deadline. The status quo of ongoing conflict strongly points to a 'Yes' outcome. The primary factor that could lead to a 'No' is a sudden and durable ceasefire, but negotiations have been protracted and unsuccessful to date. Another possibility for a 'No' outcome is if OCHA ceases to publish new reports, locking in the current figure of 295. My probability is not higher than 85% to account for these possibilities of a durable ceasefire or a halt in reporting. It is not lower because the required number of additional fatalities is very small relative to the timeframe and the consistent casualty rate observed over the past several months. I would lower my forecast if a credible, lasting ceasefire is announced and implemented. I would raise it if a major new offensive begins in a densely populated area.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025. For example, a snapshot dated April 30, 2025, [reports](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-30-april-2025) 295 UN staff fatalities.\n\nIf OCHA stops posting new updates, this resolves as the most recent number, which as of the time of this question would be the impact snapshot posted on April 30, 2025.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of April 30, 2025, the official UN OCHA impact snapshot reported 295 UN staff fatalities in Gaza.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
