    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses align remarkably well with mine, with all three of us independently arriving at very similar probabilities (38%, 38%, 35%). This strong consensus increases my confidence that we've identified the key factors correctly. They emphasized points I also considered: the February downward revisions signaling disinflationary momentum, the 2.2% threshold being only 20 basis points above the ECB's 2% target, the lack of March 2025 data creating genuine uncertainty, and normal monthly volatility in inflation readings. Forecaster 2 and 3 both explicitly framed this within the broader context of the ECB successfully bringing inflation down from 2022-2023 peaks, which reinforces the disinflationary trend narrative. No forecaster introduced materially new evidence or arguments that I hadn't already considered. The convergence at 35-38% suggests this probability range appropriately captures both the downward trend in inflation and the inherent uncertainty from monthly volatility and lack of recent data. Forecaster 3's slightly lower 35% may reflect marginally more weight on the disinflationary trend versus volatility, but the difference is minimal and within reasonable bounds.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find no compelling reason to substantially update my forecast. The strong consensus at 35-38% validates that we're appropriately weighing the key factors: (1) the documented disinflationary trend with February downward revisions, (2) the proximity of the 2.2% threshold to the 2% target (only 20 basis points), (3) the lack of March data creating uncertainty about the most recent momentum, and (4) normal monthly volatility in inflation readings. The convergence of independent analyses at similar probabilities increases my confidence that 38% appropriately balances the base case of continued disinflation against the realistic possibility of monthly volatility pushing the reading slightly above 2.2%. No new evidence was introduced that would warrant a meaningful adjustment. I remain at 38%.",
