    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The Q1 2025 13F filing deadline is 45 days after the quarter ends (March 31), which is approximately May 15, 2025. As today is May 6, 2025, the outcome will be known within the next 9 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Berkshire Hathaway's most recent public filings do not show a position in Domino's Pizza. The status quo is that they do not own the stock, or at least not in a quantity that requires disclosure.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway's Q1 2025 13F filing is released by the mid-May deadline and it shows holdings of Domino's Pizza (DPZ) at or below 2,382,000 shares. The most likely version of this scenario is that the filing shows zero shares, indicating the rumor of an initial purchase was unfounded.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway files its Q1 2025 13F, revealing for the first time a holding in Domino's Pizza (DPZ) that exceeds 2,382,000 shares. This would imply they had been quietly accumulating a position, potentially under a confidential filing request with the SEC, and continued to buy during the first quarter.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo because the premise of the question relies on an uncorroborated, likely fictional, article from 'RetailWire'. My research assistant found no additional information, which is a significant indicator that there is no credible reporting from established financial news sources (e.g., Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal) about Berkshire building a stake in Domino's. Rumors of this nature are common and usually false.\n\nWhile Domino's Pizza has some characteristics that might appeal to Berkshire Hathaway—a strong global brand, a capital-light franchise model, and a simple, understandable business—the lack of any concrete evidence is the overriding factor. For Berkshire to have accumulated a stake of this size (over $1 billion at recent prices) without any market chatter or unusual volume detection is possible, but unlikely.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 10% because the scenario is not impossible. Berkshire is known for making large, surprising investments, and it often requests confidential treatment from the SEC to build positions without alerting the market. The business profile of Domino's has some merit as a long-term holding. A 10% chance accounts for this possibility of a well-kept secret.\n\nMy probability is not higher because of the profound lack of evidence. A forecast should be based on verifiable information, and in this case, the entire basis for the 'Yes' scenario is a single, unsubstantiated source. Without corroboration, assigning a higher probability would be irresponsible speculation.\n\nI would significantly increase my forecast if any reputable financial news outlet reported on a potential stake before the filing is released. Conversely, I would lower it if Berkshire executives made public statements ruling out investments in the quick-service restaurant industry.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Domino's Pizza stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nRetailWire: [Domino’s Pizza Stake Purchased by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Group](https://retailwire.com/dominos-pizza-warren-buffett/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 2,382,000 shares of Domino's Pizza, Inc. (ticker symbol DPZ).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
