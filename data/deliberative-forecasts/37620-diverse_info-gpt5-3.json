    "review": "Both forecasters added material I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: (1) a reported May 12 walk‑back by Kadyrov reframing his earlier comment, and (2) a May 7 meeting with Putin that conveyed public endorsement. These points materially lower the odds that a politically orchestrated exit happens within the next ~19–20 days. Their emphasis on Kadyrov’s history of similar statements not leading to departure and the Kremlin’s preference for stability in Chechnya is persuasive. I still think a small residual risk remains from a health shock or sudden Kremlin decision, but the walk‑back plus fresh Putin backing push me downward from my prior estimate.",
    "rationale": "Key updates vs. my prior reasoning: The reported May 12 backtrack undercuts the signal value of the May 6 resignation comment, and a May 7 Putin endorsement signals continuity unless an exogenous health event forces a change. With only ~19 days left, the window for a choreographed transition is very narrow. The most realistic path to “Yes” is an acute health crisis that compels immediate appointment of an acting head; that tail remains non‑zero given persistent reporting on serious health issues. A Kremlin‑driven political replacement in this timeframe looks unlikely after the walk‑back and endorsement. Net: I substantially reduce the probability from 27% to reflect the stronger status‑quo signals and short horizon, while retaining a modest tail for sudden incapacity or an abrupt Kremlin move.\n\nWhat would move me up: credible multi‑source reports of hospitalization/incapacitation; official steps toward an acting head; unusual Kremlin media framing. What would move me down: frequent, credible appearances showing good health; explicit Kremlin reaffirmations; absence of any procedural signals as we approach late May.",
