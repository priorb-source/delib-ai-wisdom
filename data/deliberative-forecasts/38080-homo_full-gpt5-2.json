    "review": "Both forecasters align with my core view: short timeline plus massive third‑party harms make courts likely to preserve the status quo through July 1 via a PI or appellate stay. I found Forecaster 3’s point about a potential narrow injunction (protecting only current students, not new enrollments) especially useful—such relief might not satisfy the resolution criterion (“allowing international students to enroll”). Forecaster 2’s emphasis that even a PI denial could be briefly stayed to allow appeal is also important, reinforcing that multiple procedural off-ramps exist to keep certification effectively active into July. I largely agree with their reasoning; the narrow‑relief scenario adds a downside risk I hadn’t weighted explicitly enough.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: TRO keeps certification active now. For a No by July 1, the government likely needs a sequence: (1) PI denied and TRO dissolved without a meaningful stay; (2) First Circuit declines emergency stay; (3) DHS swiftly enforces revocation in June. That path is plausible but requires consecutive government wins under time pressure, despite strong irreparable-harm arguments for Harvard and affected students. Alternatively, a court could issue narrow relief that preserves status for current students but not new enrollments—this would fail the resolution criterion and is a real, if less common, path to No. Conversely, if the PI is granted, it likely runs past July 1; while the government could seek a stay pending appeal, obtaining and implementing it before July 1 is uncertain. Given the TRO signal, typical judicial inclination to maintain the status quo, and the short runway, I still lean Yes, but I trim slightly to account for the narrow-injunction scenario and potential rapid appellate stays.",
