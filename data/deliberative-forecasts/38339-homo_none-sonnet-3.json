    "review": "All three forecasters independently arrived at the same 20% forecast using highly similar reasoning, which is notable convergence. Each emphasized: (1) the extremely short 25-day timeframe as a major constraint, (2) the strong status quo bias favoring agreement continuation, (3) the complexity of international energy contracts, and (4) the crucial lack of recent information suggesting imminent action. All acknowledged that while serious problems exist (debt crisis, high-level political pressure), evidence of problems does not equal evidence of imminent cancellation. The shared analysis correctly distinguishes between wanting to exit an agreement and actually executing that exit within 3.5 weeks. No forecaster introduced evidence or arguments that significantly challenge or enhance the others' reasoning. The resolution criteria leniency (requiring only an announcement) was universally noted as a factor preventing even lower forecasts. This degree of independent convergence suggests we've collectively identified the key considerations and are calibrating similarly to the available evidence.",
    "rationale": "The unanimous convergence at 20% reinforces my initial assessment rather than challenging it. The deliberation revealed no new evidence, overlooked factors, or logical flaws in the original reasoning. The core argument remains compelling: international commercial energy agreements operate with institutional inertia, legal complexity, and diplomatic considerations that make rapid cancellation within 25 days highly unlikely, especially absent any evidence of imminent action. The documented financial pressures and political engagement prevent a near-zero forecast, but the status quo is powerful and the timeframe severely constraining. No forecaster provided information that would justify moving higher (no evidence of active termination proceedings or imminent announcements) or lower (the genuine pressures and high-level political involvement remain). The independent validation of this reasoning through three separate analyses increases my confidence that 20% appropriately balances the competing factors.",
