  "information": "The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) granted two 10-year licenses to Starlink Services Bangladesh Limited, as reported on April 30, 2025. This allows the company to provide commercial internet services and import necessary equipment. The approval followed Starlink's registration with the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) on March 29, 2025. Public statements from SpaceX executives and Bangladeshi government officials have targeted a May 2025 launch. In late March, interim leader Muhammad Yunus announced plans to finalize a commercial deal with Starlink within three months. A trial run of the service was conducted on April 9, 2025, during an investment summit.\n\nIn mid-May 2025, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, along with other Senate Democrats, called for a federal investigation into whether the Trump administration helped SpaceX secure foreign deals, including in Bangladesh. The senators allege that favorable treatment from foreign governments may have been exchanged for tariff favors, which they described as potential 'crony capitalism' and a 'quid pro quo' that could violate federal ethics laws. They have written to the Department of Justice and the White House ethics office requesting a probe into the matter.\n\nThe typical time between Starlink receiving a license and service being listed as 'Available' in a country has ranged from under three months to over one year. Faster rollouts have generally occurred in countries that issued express government invitations and where Starlink had an existing ground station or permission to use foreign gateways. SpaceX can serve Bangladesh using its existing laser-linked satellites without waiting for local gateways to be built. Following the license approval, it was reported that Starlink is preparing a tariff plan to be submitted to the Bangladeshi regulator for review.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (deadline: July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Bangladesh is not yet shown as Available on Starlink’s map, and absent further steps it would likely remain so.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Post-license steps (tariff/price approval by BTRC, consumer T&C clearance, device type approvals, customs/ISP operational setup) slip into July or later; SpaceX slows rollout amid U.S. political scrutiny or local lobbying by incumbents; Starlink keeps Bangladesh as Coming Soon until commercial terms are finalized.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "BTRC swiftly approves Starlink’s tariff plan and any remaining paperwork; SpaceX opens orders and publishes Bangladesh pricing; the availability map flips to Available (even if only part of the country) in late May or June, leveraging existing laser backhaul without a local gateway.",
    "rationale": "What we know: • BTRC granted Starlink two 10‑year licenses on April 30, 2025, following BIDA registration on March 29. • A trial run occurred April 9. • Officials and SpaceX signaled an ambitious May 2025 launch target. • Starlink is preparing a tariff plan for BTRC review. • Mid‑May, several U.S. senators requested a federal probe into alleged assistance for foreign deals, including Bangladesh.  Base rates and timing: The lag between licensing and map availability has varied from under 3 months to over a year. Bangladesh would be about 2 months from licensing by July 1—within the faster end of historical rollouts, especially where governments invite rapid deployment and where laser-linked satellites avoid the need for an immediate local gateway. Bangladesh’s leadership has been publicly supportive, which is a favorable signal.  Key friction points: • Tariff/price plan approval and any consumer protection filings are the most likely gating items before Starlink flips the map to Available (Starlink typically posts country pricing and opens orders when it marks a country Available). • Potential bureaucratic delays (device type approvals, customs, local ISP operational readiness) could push beyond late June, even if not technically required for satellite connectivity. • The U.S. political probe likely won’t directly block Bangladesh, but it could make SpaceX more cautious about optics, marginally increasing delay risk.  Why not higher than my forecast: There are only ~6½ weeks left. Even supportive regulators can take weeks to clear tariffs and ancillary approvals. The historical distribution of post-license rollouts has a substantial right tail; slipping into July or later is plausible.  Why not lower: Bangladesh has already issued 10‑year licenses and held a public trial; leadership has explicitly backed a near-term launch. Starlink can operate via ISL backhaul, reducing infrastructure dependencies. A late‑May or June availability flip is consistent with public targets.  What would move me up: • Official BTRC approval of Starlink’s tariff/price plan; • Starlink publishing Bangladesh pricing or enabling address checks/orders; • Reports of first customer shipments or enterprise/government activations in Bangladesh.  What would move me down: • Public indication that tariff approval or additional permits will take longer; • Political or legal hurdles raised by BTRC or the interim government; • Signals from SpaceX of a delayed South Asia rollout.  Weighing these, I put extra weight on the status quo inertia but give substantial credit to the strong governmental support and recent licensing. Net, I see a modest edge toward a Yes within the window.",
