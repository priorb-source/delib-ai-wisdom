  "information": "Multiple reports highlighted significant macroeconomic concerns. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 6.7%, the highest level recorded since 1981, with consumers widely citing worries about tariffs. The share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise increased for the fifth consecutive month, reaching its highest point since 2009. Concurrently, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators registered four consecutive monthly drops. Policy uncertainty was also a factor, with ongoing tariff implementation, market volatility, and potential changes in Federal Reserve leadership.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks. The University of Michigan releases preliminary consumer sentiment data in the middle of each month, so the May 2025 preliminary results should be available around mid-May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - Consumer sentiment remains at or below 50.8. The fundamental drivers of the April decline (tariff concerns, elevated inflation expectations at 6.7%, rising unemployment fears) are structural issues unlikely to resolve quickly, suggesting sentiment will remain depressed at similar levels.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 consumer sentiment remains at or falls below 50.8 as tariff implementation continues to generate uncertainty, inflation expectations stay elevated, unemployment concerns persist, and market volatility continues. Policy uncertainty around Federal Reserve leadership and ongoing economic indicators showing weakness maintain the depressed sentiment levels from April.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 consumer sentiment rises above 50.8 due to positive developments such as: tariff concerns moderating or being delayed, positive economic data releases showing resilience, Federal Reserve providing reassuring guidance about monetary policy, financial markets stabilizing, or simply natural volatility causing a partial bounce from the extreme April low.",
    "rationale": "The April 2025 reading of 50.8 represents the second-lowest consumer sentiment on record dating back to 1952, indicating exceptional consumer pessimism. The research assistant's report highlights severe underlying concerns: inflation expectations at 6.7% (highest since 1981), rising unemployment expectations (highest since 2009), and multiple consecutive drops in Leading Economic Indicators. These are structural issues driven by tariff policy, not temporary shocks.\n\nHowever, several factors support potential improvement. Consumer sentiment is inherently volatile and can swing significantly month-to-month. Extreme readings often exhibit mean reversion tendencies - when sentiment hits historical lows, partial bounces are common unless conditions actively deteriorate further. With 3-4 weeks until the May reading, there's time for: any positive tariff news, market stabilization, reassuring Fed communications, or simply the natural volatility of the measure to produce an uptick.\n\nThe status quo strongly favors NO given the persistent nature of the underlying concerns. The fundamental drivers (tariffs, inflation fears, unemployment concerns) won't resolve in one month. Yet the extreme nature of the April reading (second-lowest ever) and typical mean reversion patterns suggest some probability of recovery.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: (1) the structural issues remain unresolved, (2) policy uncertainty continues, (3) leading indicators show ongoing weakness, and (4) such extreme lows often reflect real, persistent problems. My forecast is not lower because: (1) consumer sentiment is volatile, (2) extreme readings often partially reverse, (3) any positive news could boost sentiment, and (4) we're dealing with a survey measure susceptible to monthly fluctuations.\n\nI would update higher if: tariff policies were softened or delayed, positive economic data emerged, or Fed provided strong reassurance. I would update lower if: tariffs intensified, economic data worsened, or new negative shocks emerged.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMultiple reports highlighted significant macroeconomic concerns. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 6.7%, the highest level recorded since 1981, with consumers widely citing worries about tariffs. The share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise increased for the fifth consecutive month, reaching its highest point since 2009.

Policy uncertainty was also a factor, with ongoing tariff implementation, market volatility, and potential changes in Federal Reserve leadership.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
