    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 months (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ratification bill does not make it through South Sudan’s cabinet and parliament in time, or it passes domestically but the instrument of ratification is not deposited with the African Union before July 1 due to administrative delays, competing political priorities, or parliamentary recess.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The government prioritizes AfCFTA under external pressure and economic signaling around mid‑year AU meetings; cabinet approves, the R‑TNLA passes the ratification quickly, the president signs, and the instrument is deposited with the AU Commission before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Time constraint: With roughly 60 days left, completing all steps (cabinet approval, parliamentary passage, presidential assent, and formal deposit with the AU) typically requires focused political will. Short timelines favor the status quo (no ratification yet). \n- Status quo and base rates: As of late 2024, public trackers generally did not list South Sudan among ratified parties, indicating longstanding delay. Countries that lag for years often continue to lag absent a clear trigger. \n- Capacity and priorities: South Sudan faces persistent governance and security challenges that can slow legislative throughput and divert attention from trade agreements. That makes rapid action less likely. \n- Reasons for some chance of Yes: Ratification is relatively low-cost politically and can be fast-tracked when prioritized. The AU’s mid‑year cycle (often in July) sometimes creates deadlines that spur last‑minute deposits. The cited summit signaling an economic push suggests some appetite to move, and external partners may encourage a quick ratification. \n- Why not higher: There is no concrete evidence (per the research assistant: no additional information) of a bill already tabled, passed, or an imminent deposit. The short window and historical inertia weigh against rapid completion. \n- Why not lower: Ratification can occur quickly once leadership decides; external pressure and desire to signal reform can catalyze action. A single parliamentary session plus prompt deposit could meet the deadline. \n- Updaters: I would raise the forecast on credible reports that (1) the cabinet has approved the instrument, (2) the R‑TNLA has scheduled a vote or passed the bill, (3) the Ministry of Trade/Justice announces submission to AU, or (4) the AU/AfCFTA Secretariat acknowledges receipt pending deposit. I would lower it if parliament enters recess without scheduling, political turmoil diverts the agenda, or officials indicate ratification will slip to later in 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill South Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Star Worldwide via MSN: [World Chambers Africa Summit maps economic path for South Sudan](https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/other/world-chambers-africa-summit-maps-economic-path-for-south-sudan/ar-AA1CTigs?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if South Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
