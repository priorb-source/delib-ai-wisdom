    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — North Korea does not conduct a nuclear test",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "DPRK continues frequent missile and space launches plus hostile rhetoric but refrains from a seventh nuclear test. The Punggye-ri site remains in a state of latent readiness without the final surge of pre-test activity; China quietly discourages a test and Pyongyang judges benefits don’t outweigh risks in the short window. Any provocations around late June (e.g., Korean War anniversary) are non-nuclear.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "DPRK conducts a seventh nuclear test at Punggye-ri to validate a new or miniaturized warhead (e.g., for tactical use) or to mark a political moment (e.g., reacting to allied exercises or to signal a new phase in deterrence). CTBTO’s IMS and global seismology detect a clear event; state media claims success and external analysts estimate yield.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates/status quo: There have been six DPRK nuclear tests (last in 2017) and none in the past ~7.5 years despite recurring indications the site could be reactivated. Over the last several years, outside observers repeatedly judged a test was possible “any time,” yet it did not occur. With only ~2 months left, the default outcome is No.\n- Signals that raise risk: Punggye-ri has reportedly been maintained in test-capable condition since 2022; DPRK has emphasized tactical nukes and new delivery systems; UN Security Council cohesion is weaker, potentially lowering costs. Dates like June 25 (Korean War anniversary) can be used for high-profile provocations.\n- Signals that lower risk: Even amid intense missile testing and harsher rhetoric, Pyongyang has avoided the higher-cost step of a nuclear test for years, likely due to Chinese preference for stability and Pyongyang’s ability to signal credibility via missiles/simulations. Spring allied exercises passed without a test; the remaining calendar window before July 1 is short.\n- Why not higher: If an annual hazard of a test in a typical recent year is on the order of low double-digits, a two‑month window implies only a several‑percent chance absent acute triggers. Years of non-testing despite readiness argue for a low baseline hazard.\n- Why not lower: The site appears capable; geopolitical cover from Russia/China reduces punishment risk; DPRK may want to validate warhead designs for new systems. A late-June provocation is plausible.\n- What would move me up: Fresh satellite evidence of final pre-test steps (new spoil piles, significant vehicle activity at Tunnel 3/4, perimeter security upgrades, instrumentation lines, VIP visits), evacuation notices near the site, or clear state-media signaling tied to a specific milestone. A sharp crisis with the US/ROK/JPN or major allied exercises in June could also raise risk.\n- What would move me down: High-confidence reporting of site inactivity or degradation; overt Chinese pressure for restraint; a shift of DPRK focus to alternative provocations (e.g., space launch windows) explicitly telegraphed for June.\n- Research assistant input: None (no additional information available), so this forecast relies on historical base rates, known structural incentives, and generic signal interpretation.\nOverall, the short remaining window and the multi-year pattern of restraint keep the probability low but non-trivial given maintained readiness and potential political triggers.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill North Korea test a nuclear weapon before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and in 2017.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting such as the [International Monitoring System’s ](https://www.ctbto.org/our-work/detecting-nuclear-tests) and the sources cited at Wikipedia's [List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
