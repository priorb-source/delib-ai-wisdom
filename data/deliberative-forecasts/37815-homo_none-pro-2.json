    "review": "The other forecasters have presented a compelling and data-driven case that I find persuasive. My initial forecast of 15% was based on an estimate of 1-3 qualifying reports per year, but their analyses have convinced me this was a significant overestimate. Forecaster 3's argument that such reports in the NUFORC database are typically separated by years, not months, is a crucial detail that directly challenges my initial assumption. Similarly, Forecaster 2's point that pilots in South America are more likely to report to official national aviation or military bodies than to a US-based civilian website like NUFORC is a strong argument that I had not sufficiently weighted. Both forecasters provided a more rigorous base-rate analysis, leading to a tighter and more credible forecast range.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from the other two forecasters, I am updating my forecast significantly downwards. My initial forecast of 15% was too optimistic and placed excessive weight on the general increase in UAP awareness, while underestimating the extreme rarity of a report meeting these highly specific criteria in the NUFORC database. The core reason for my update is the convincing evidence presented by the other forecasters that the base rate for a pilot report from South America appearing on NUFORC is much lower than I had initially estimated. Their assertion that such reports are closer to once-every-few-years events, rather than 1-3 times per year, is a much more sober and likely accurate reading of the historical data. The argument that pilots have more official and proximate channels for reporting is also a key factor that lowers the probability of a report appearing on this specific US-based platform. I am therefore aligning my forecast with their consensus, as their reasoning is better supported by the likely patterns within the resolution source.",
