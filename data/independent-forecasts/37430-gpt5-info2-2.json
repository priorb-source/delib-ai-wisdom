  "information": "As of late April 2025, reports indicated that the Tax Reform Bill had been passed by the Nigerian House of Representatives and was awaiting approval from the Senate before requiring presidential assent. Taiwo Oyedele, Chairman of the Presidential Tax Reform Committee, had stated in January 2025 that the bills were expected to be passed into law in the first quarter of 2025, with implementation scheduled to begin on July 1, 2025. The Q1 2025 deadline for passage has been missed.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Senate does not pass the Tax Reform Bill in time, or passes a version requiring lengthy harmonization with the House that slips into late June; presidential assent then occurs after July 1. Alternatively, the Senate removes the VAT exemption for real estate from the final text, or leadership decides to decouple or defer that provision.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Senate takes up the House-passed bill in May/early June, passes a harmonized version that retains the VAT exemption for real estate, and the President promptly assents before July 1, enabling the administration’s planned July 1 implementation start date.",
    "rationale": "- Time: Roughly eight weeks remain—enough for Nigeria’s National Assembly to move a priority, executive-backed bill through Senate passage, harmonization (if needed), and presidential assent.\n- Momentum: Reports in late April indicate the House has passed the Tax Reform Bill and the Senate is next. The administration’s tax reform team (Oyedele) has publicly targeted a July 1 implementation, signaling prioritization. The Senate is aligned with the presidency, which generally increases passage odds for flagship fiscal measures.\n- Risks and reasons not higher: The Q1 passage target was missed, reflecting slippage risk. The bill appears multi-pronged; contentious items elsewhere in the package could slow the process or invite amendments. Any conference committee delay or a late-June calendar crunch could push assent past July 1. There is also a non-zero chance the VAT exemption for real estate is pared back to protect VAT revenues shared with states.\n- Reasons not lower: The reform is presidentially driven, House passage is already secured, and the real estate VAT exemption is being publicly touted, making it less likely to be quietly dropped. Nigeria’s legislature can move quickly on priority fiscal bills when needed.\n- What would move me up: Senate scheduling of second/third readings, fast-track or committee report dates; confirmation the exemption remains in the Senate version; indications of presidential assent timetable. What would move me down: Signals of splitting the bill, pushback from state revenue stakeholders, reports of committee bottlenecks, or the Senate calendar slipping into late June without passage.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Nigeria enact legislation exempting real estate transactions from VAT before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[FG: Tax reform bill to exempt real estate transactions from VAT, boost housing affordability in Nigeria](https://nairametrics.com/2025/04/25/fg-tax-reform-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat-boost-housing-affordability-in-nigeria/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the government of Nigeria enacts legislation exempting real estate transactions from the Value Added Tax (VAT) according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nFor example, the current iteration of the Tax Reforms Bill that is [being considered](https://brtnews.ng/tax-reforms-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat/) by the National Assembly, if it should be enacted, would count for purposes of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late April 2025, reports indicated that the Tax Reform Bill had been passed by the Nigerian House of Representatives and was awaiting approval from the Senate before requiring presidential assent. Taiwo Oyedele, Chairman of the Presidential Tax Reform Committee, had stated in January 2025 that the bills were expected to be passed into law in the first quarter of 2025, with implementation scheduled to begin on July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
