    "no_outcome_scenario": "North Korea's leadership continues its current strategic posture, engaging in missile tests and strong rhetoric but refraining from crossing the significant red line of a seventh nuclear test. The potential for severe international sanctions, particularly from China, and the belief that its current arsenal is a sufficient deterrent, lead Pyongyang to maintain the nuclear testing moratorium that has been in place since 2017.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to a perceived geopolitical threat, or to demonstrate a new technical capability such as a miniaturized tactical warhead, Kim Jong Un orders a nuclear test. This action is taken to force the United States and its allies to change their policy, to bolster domestic support, or to signal a deeper strategic alignment with Russia. Preparations at the Punggye-ri test site, which have long been complete, are activated, leading to a detonation before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted on the status quo. North Korea has not conducted a nuclear test since September 2017, establishing a long-standing moratorium of over seven and a half years. The world generally changes slowly, and a major policy shift like resuming nuclear testing is a high-stakes decision unlikely to be made lightly, especially within the short two-month timeframe of this question.\n\nThe primary reason my forecast is not lower than 5% is that South Korean and U.S. intelligence have consistently assessed for over two years that North Korea has completed all necessary preparations for a seventh nuclear test at its Punggye-ri site and could conduct one at any time with little warning. The decision is purely political. Furthermore, increased cooperation between North Korea and Russia may embolden Pyongyang, reducing its fear of international isolation and sanctions. A test could also be used to validate a new warhead design, such as a tactical nuclear weapon, which is a stated goal of their weapons program.\n\nThe primary reason my forecast is not higher is the significant geopolitical risk and cost to North Korea. A new test would trigger immediate, widespread international condemnation and likely lead to a new round of severe UN Security Council sanctions. Critically, it would alienate China, Pyongyang's most important economic and political partner, which values regional stability and has previously supported sanctions in response to nuclear tests. North Korea may calculate that the strategic ambiguity of being a 'ready-to-test' nuclear power is more beneficial than the concrete consequences of actually conducting a test.\n\nI received no additional information from my research assistant. I would increase my probability forecast upon observing new satellite imagery showing heightened, last-minute activity at Punggye-ri, or if there is a sharp and specific escalation in rhetoric from Pyongyang explicitly threatening a nuclear test. I would decrease my forecast if there were any signs of renewed high-level diplomatic engagement involving North Korea.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill North Korea test a nuclear weapon before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and in 2017.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting such as the [International Monitoring System’s ](https://www.ctbto.org/our-work/detecting-nuclear-tests) and the sources cited at Wikipedia's [List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
