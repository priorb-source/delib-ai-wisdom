  "information": "Resignations from the European Parliament frequently occur when a sitting MEP is appointed to a ministerial position within their national government. Following elections in several member states, new governments were in the process of being formed. Specifically, after the May 18 elections in Portugal, there were rumors that at least two MEPs were being considered for cabinet positions in the new government. Other countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, also had fluid political circumstances that could lead to cabinet reshuffles.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No Member of the European Parliament (MEP) announces their resignation within the specified timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The formation of new national governments, particularly in Portugal, concludes without appointing any sitting MEPs. Alternatively, any appointments and subsequent resignations are announced before June 10 or after June 30. Furthermore, no MEPs resign for other reasons, such as the ongoing Huawei lobbying scandal or personal matters, within the resolution window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sitting MEP, for example from Portugal, is appointed to a cabinet position in their new national government and announces their resignation from the European Parliament between June 10 and June 30, 2025. Alternatively, an MEP resigns due to mounting pressure from the Huawei lobbying scandal or for an unrelated personal reason.",
    "rationale": "My forecast places significant weight on factors that challenge the status quo of no resignations. The primary driver is the high likelihood of MEPs being appointed to national governments following recent elections. My research assistant's report highlights the post-election government formation in Portugal, which concluded on May 18, and specifically notes rumors of at least two MEPs being considered for cabinet posts. The timing aligns well with the resolution window of June 10-30 for such appointments to be finalized and announced. The fluid political situations in Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium provide additional, albeit less certain, pathways to a 'Yes' outcome. The Huawei lobbying scandal mentioned in the background material represents another independent factor that could precipitate a resignation under political pressure. While any single MEP is unlikely to resign in a given three-week period, across a body of 720 members, and with several specific potential catalysts, the probability of at least one resignation is elevated. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the timing is very specific. Government formation processes can be unpredictable and may conclude before or after the resolution window. The rumors about Portuguese MEPs may not materialize into actual appointments. \n\nMy forecast is not lower because there are multiple, credible, and independent potential triggers for a resignation. The situation in Portugal is a particularly strong and timely signal that makes a purely base-rate forecast of a rare event inappropriate. \n\nI would increase my forecast upon hearing concrete news of a sitting MEP being formally offered a ministerial role in any member state. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if the new Portuguese government is announced before June 10 and includes no sitting MEPs, or as the deadline of June 30 approaches without any news.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the European Parliament announces their resignation after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nResignations from the European Parliament frequently occur when a sitting MEP is appointed to a ministerial position within their national government.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
