    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core facts I used: 22.7M already in D1–D4 as of May 27, a 2.7M buffer above the threshold; June is climatologically dry; CPC outlook favors heat and drought persistence. New/useful nuance: Forecaster 3 highlights that USDM reclassifications typically require sustained improvement, which supports a higher probability for Yes. The main counterweight they raise is potential tropical moisture (Alvin) and subsequent trough-driven rain. I agree that’s the most plausible No path, but I find Forecaster 2’s willingness to drop below 50% if that track firms up to be too reactive; a single early-summer event would need to be unusually widespread and soaking across major metros to shave >2.7M from D1 in one or two weekly cycles, and USDM tends to be conservative about rapid upgrades in summer. The reservoir/snowpack points (Oroville 86%, March snowpack ~96% of normal) may temper further deterioration but don’t compel rapid D1 removal in populous SoCal/central coast absent notable precipitation. Overall, their arguments largely reinforce the status-quo Yes case; they don’t introduce evidence that materially weakens it.",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution is about 30 days, with the relevant USDM map likely valid June 24 and published June 26. With 22.7M already in drought, dropping below 20.0M would require substantial improvement in/around large population centers (especially Southern California). Seasonal climatology, CPC persistence/heat outlooks, and the conservative nature of USDM downgrades in summer all favor either steady or worsening drought conditions. While an early EPAC system plus a trough could bring rain, June events rarely deliver broad, multi-inch totals across SoCal/Bay Area, and even if they did, USDM may not immediately clear D1 across millions of residents. Given that the other forecasters largely confirm this logic and add that USDM typically needs sustained improvement, I see no reason to lower my probability. I maintain a modest tail risk for an anomalous, well-timed widespread rain event that trims D1 around dense metros, but I judge that as unlikely within the short window.",
