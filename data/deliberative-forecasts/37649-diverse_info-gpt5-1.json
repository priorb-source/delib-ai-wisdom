    "review": "Forecaster 2’s main bearish point hinges on a “6+ months since license” claim; that conflicts with the research assistant’s March 13, 2025 official license date. If November 2024 reflected a preliminary/announced license rather than the formal operating authorization, the true window is ~9 weeks elapsed, not 6+ months, which weakens their argument. Their cited obstacles (import rules, spectrum fees) could be real but were not substantiated here. Landlocked status is not a major technical blocker for Starlink given ISL. Forecaster 3’s precedent-based analysis is useful: 10–24 week license-to-availability timelines in Africa bracket Chad’s 15.5-week window to the July 1 deadline, making this a close call. The cited May 2025 SpaceX–Airtel partnership could accelerate kit distribution, but I can’t verify it here; I treat it as uncertain upside. Overall, F3’s timing analysis slightly strengthens a modestly-above-coinflip view; F2’s argument is less persuasive due to the timeline inconsistency.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~6.5 weeks. From March 13 to July 1 is ~15.5 weeks total, with ~9 weeks elapsed and ~6.5 weeks left. In Africa, observed license-to-availability lags have ranged roughly 10–24 weeks. That places Chad’s window right around the middle of historical outcomes: a borderline but feasible launch by the deadline. Positives: the key regulatory gate appears cleared, government messaging emphasized affordability (suggesting coordination on pricing/compliance), and Starlink’s operational maturity enables relatively fast flips once commercial and logistics pieces are in place. Negatives: African rollouts can snag on import/type-approval, taxation, payment rails, or last‑minute regulatory conditions; any slip could push to Q3, and Starlink sometimes updates the map to “Starting Q3 2025,” which would doom this question. Given the mixed but slightly favorable setup and the precedent timelines, I stay modestly above 50%, nudging up slightly on the structured precedent argument while discounting unverified obstacles and the unconfirmed Airtel claim.",
