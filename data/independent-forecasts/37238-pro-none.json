    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 months. The date and location for UFC 316 have not yet been officially announced, but based on the UFC's event numbering schedule, it is anticipated to take place in the third quarter of 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Donald Trump has a well-established history of attending major UFC events, and the provided background information confirms he attended one as recently as April 2025. The status quo is that he will continue this pattern.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "UFC 316 is scheduled to take place at an international venue, making travel and attendance less likely. Alternatively, a significant and unavoidable scheduling conflict arises, such as a major political event, a legal requirement, or a personal health issue that prevents him from attending, even if the event is domestic.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "UFC 316 is held in a major US city, such as Las Vegas or Miami. Donald Trump's schedule remains open for the event night, and he capitalizes on the public relations opportunity by attending, sitting cageside with UFC President Dana White, and greeting the crowd.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on Donald Trump's strong and consistent history of attending high-profile UFC events. The provided New York Times article, dated just over two weeks ago, establishes a very recent precedent for this behavior, making it a powerful predictor. His friendship with UFC President Dana White and the reliably positive reception he receives from the UFC audience provide strong incentives for him to attend. These appearances serve as effective, informal campaign stops that reinforce his public image. The research assistant's report indicates no new information, meaning there is currently no evidence to suggest a deviation from this established pattern. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 75% primarily because key details about UFC 316 are still unknown. The most significant variable is the location; if the event is held internationally, the likelihood of his attendance would decrease dramatically. Furthermore, as a major political figure, his schedule is subject to unforeseen, high-priority changes, and personal or health issues could arise at any time. \n\nMy probability is not lower because the base rate of attendance is exceptionally strong. To forecast against such a clear and recently demonstrated pattern would require specific negative evidence, such as a confirmed scheduling conflict or a statement indicating he will not attend, none of which currently exists. \n\nI would increase my forecast if the event is officially announced for a major US city he frequents. I would decrease it significantly if an international location is chosen or if a major conflicting event on that date is added to his public schedule.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend UFC 316?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Trump and Some of His Cabinet Members Attend U.F.C. Fight in Miami](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/trump-ufc-fight-reyes.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump is anywhere within the grounds of the venue where [UFC 316](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-316) takes place. Otherwise this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
