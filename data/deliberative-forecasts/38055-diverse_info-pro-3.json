    "review": "All three forecasters used a similar and effective two-part framework: the probability of the fight occurring multiplied by the conditional probability of Pyfer winning. The key divergence was in the estimation of these two probabilities, driven by different assumptions. Forecaster 3's analysis was based on a flawed timeline premise that the fight was '12 days away', leading them to an overly optimistic 85-90% chance of the fight happening. Forecaster 2's assumption of a 'three months away' timeline is more plausible for a rebooked fight and aligns with my own thinking, placing the cancellation risk appropriately around 20-25%. The most valuable input came from both forecasters' arguments regarding Pyfer's conditional win probability. They made a convincing case that my initial 70% estimate was too high, citing Kelvin Gastelum's durability (only one TKO loss), his veteran experience, and his wrestling-heavy style as a potential blueprint to replicate the success Jack Hermansson had against Pyfer.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 53% to 45%. My reasoning has two parts. First, I am maintaining my estimate that there is a 75% chance the fight occurs at UFC 316. The cancellation risk for a fight several months away is significant, and this particular bout has been canceled before. I believe Forecaster 3's higher estimate is based on an incorrect timeline assumption. Second, and more importantly, the other forecasters convinced me to lower my estimate of Pyfer's win probability if the fight happens. My initial 70% was too confident and did not give enough weight to Kelvin Gastelum's specific strengths. His proven durability blunts Pyfer's primary weapon (KO power), and his wrestling and experience present a clear path to victory, as demonstrated in Pyfer's loss to Jack Hermansson. Therefore, I have revised Pyfer's conditional win probability down from 70% to a more moderate 60%. This still acknowledges him as the favorite but better reflects the substantial threat Gastelum poses. My updated calculation is 75% (chance of fight) * 60% (chance of win) = 45%.",
