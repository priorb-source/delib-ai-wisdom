    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (from May 29, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Morning Consult’s early May snapshot had Sánchez at ~35% vs. Erdoğan ~32%. If that relationship holds into early July, Sánchez remains higher.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Erdoğan’s approval rebounds several points (e.g., into the mid-to-high 30s) on improving economic sentiment or nationalistic rally effects, while Sánchez stagnates or dips (e.g., domestic political turbulence or a negative news cycle), producing Erdoğan ≥ Sánchez (including a tie).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Both leaders’ ratings remain roughly where they are, or Erdoğan softens further amid persistent inflation/cost-of-living pressures while Spain’s relatively steady economy and political status quo keep Sánchez near the mid-30s, maintaining Sánchez > Erdoğan.",
    "rationale": "- What we know now: The research assistant cites Morning Consult figures around May 8, 2025 showing Pedro Sánchez at 35% and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at 32%, a ~3-point edge for Sánchez. Morning Consult’s series typically moves gradually week to week given its trailing 7-day average methodology.\n- Time horizon and inertia: With just ~1 month to go, leader approval ratings usually change modestly absent major shocks. Given the current spread favors Sánchez, the status quo points to a Yes outcome. I place extra weight on this because the world tends to change slowly over such short windows.\n- Context from assistant’s notes: Turkey’s consumer confidence improved in April, which could support a mild Erdoğan rebound, but Turkey still faces very high inflation and tight monetary policy—headwinds that have weighed on his approval. Spain’s economy has been comparatively resilient in Europe, which likely helps Sánchez’s floor. Sánchez’s strong stance on Gaza/Palestine recognition could be polarizing domestically but has been a steady feature for months; no clear sign of a late-breaking effect large enough to swing several points in a month.\n- Why not higher than my forecast? Historically, Erdoğan has often polled higher than Sánchez on Morning Consult, so a reversion-to-mean risk exists, especially if Turkish macro sentiment continues to improve. The resolution rule counts a tie as No, and the check is “on or after” July 1, so a late update could flip the ordering. Measurement noise and rounding also add small downside risk to a narrow lead.\n- Why not lower? The current observed ordering favors Sánchez by a few points, and there is limited time for a full reversal. Without a significant positive surprise in Turkey or a negative shock in Spain, a large swing seems unlikely within a month.\n- What would move me upward? A mid-June Morning Consult update still showing Sánchez ahead by ~2+ points; fresh signs of Turkish inflation pressure or political controversy; Spanish macro outperformance headlines; or signals that Erdoğan’s constitutional push is unpopular.\n- What would move me downward? A June update showing Erdoğan back to the mid/upper 30s or Sánchez slipping to low 30s; tangible Turkish disinflation or good-news shock lifting sentiment; a Spanish political scandal or coalition instability that dents Sánchez within the June window; or any indication Morning Consult will not report one leader’s figure at the check time (introducing resolution risk).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Pedro Sánchez has a higher approval rating than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
