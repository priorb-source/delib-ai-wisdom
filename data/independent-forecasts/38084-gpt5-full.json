  "information": "According to the resolution source, drought.gov, approximately 22.7 million California residents were living in areas of drought (classified as D1-D4) as of the week of May 27, 2025. The U.S. Drought Monitor map, which provides this data, is updated weekly. Earlier in the year, on March 25, 2025, the California Department of Water Resources reported that water storage at Lake Oroville was 86% full and the statewide snowpack was at 96% of the normal level for that date. Consequently, the State Water Project increased its water allocation forecast to 40% of requested supplies.\n\nIn late May 2025, the National Weather Service issued extreme heat watches and advisories for several inland regions of California, with temperatures forecasted to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center also forecasted higher-than-usual temperatures across much of the state for the summer of 2025. NOAA's outlook indicated that the ongoing drought would likely persist through the end of August, with an above-normal risk for significant wildfires from June through August.\n\nA late May 2025 weather forecast for the Bay Area noted a period of unusual weather activity, including a forecasted hot weather event followed by a sharp cooldown. The same forecast mentioned the potential formation of Tropical Storm Alvin in the Eastern Pacific. According to the report, this storm system could track northwest towards California and interact with a low-pressure system, potentially bringing widespread storm activity and rainfall. This was to be followed by a trough of low pressure from Canada, resulting in below-average temperatures and showers.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (until June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Early-to-mid June brings an unusually strong, widespread, multi-day soaking event to Southern and Central California (e.g., a tropical moisture surge interacting with a cut-off low) that delivers significant rainfall to major population centers (Los Angeles, Inland Empire, Bay Area). The US Drought Monitor then trims D1 coverage in these metros enough to bring the statewide “people in drought (D1–D4)” below 20.0 million by the week of June 24.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Typical early-summer pattern persists: limited precipitation, episodes of heat and drying, and CPC’s drought persistence outlook verifies. D1–D4 coverage remains similar or expands modestly, keeping “people in drought” well above 20 million when the June 24 map (posted June 26) is shown on June 28.",
    "rationale": "- Where things stand: The research assistant reports approximately 22.7 million Californians in D1–D4 as of the week of May 27, 2025. That’s already 2.7 million above the 20.0 million threshold. The US Drought Monitor (USDM) updates weekly and will show the week of June 24 on/after June 26, which is what Metaculus will likely see on June 28.\n- Seasonal backdrop and outlooks: California’s climatology in late June is typically dry. NOAA/CPC outlooks call for above-normal temperatures and drought persistence through at least August, with elevated wildfire risk. A late-May heat event and continued warmth favor either persistence or expansion of dryness, not rapid improvement.\n- What it takes to flip to No: To drop from 22.7M to below 20.0M in ~4 weeks would require sizable D1 reductions in high-population areas (especially Los Angeles and surrounding counties, possibly parts of the Bay Area or Central Valley). USDM adjustments are based on multiple indicators (precip deficits, soil moisture, streamflow, impacts); a single short rainfall episode rarely removes D1 over large metro regions in summer unless it is unusually widespread and wet. While a potential early Eastern Pacific tropical system was mentioned, such events rarely deliver broad, heavy, multi-day rains to California in June, and even then USDM may be cautious in downgrading D1 quickly.\n- Status quo weight: Given 22.7M now and summer persistence signals, the status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. Week-to-week USDM population-in-drought swings of 2–3 million are possible near big metros, but achieving that in the improving direction during early summer is unlikely without an anomalous storm sequence.\n- Why not higher: There is some tail risk that an atypical early-summer trough/tropical moisture interaction produces widespread soaking rains, or that USDM analysis trims D1 around large population centers more than expected due to short-term moisture and favorable hydrologic indicators (reservoirs and late-season snowmelt are not bad this year). Either could narrowly pull the count under 20.0M.\n- Why not lower: Current count already exceeds the threshold by a meaningful margin; CPC expects persistence; heat events and normal June dryness argue against broad improvement. California’s dry-season pattern typically doesn’t deliver the kind of rainfall needed to erase D1 over millions of people in a few weeks.\n- What would change my view:\n  • Upward (toward higher Yes): If the next 1–2 USDM releases show stable or increasing “people in drought,” or models show continued heat/dryness with no organized early June storm for SoCal/central coast.\n  • Downward (toward more No): If credible forecasts lock in an unusually wet, multi-day event in early/mid June that targets SoCal and the Bay Area with widespread, soaking rain, followed by USDM narratives indicating likely D1 improvements in populous counties.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025.
