    "review": "Both forecasters appropriately anchor on the Africa pilot-report base rate (≈0.4–0.6/year) and translate it to a monthly Poisson probability near 3–5%. They also correctly note the compounding specificity (pilot + Africa + June). I agree with their skepticism that the Jan 1, 2025 Rwanda report indicates a structural shift; a single data point doesn’t justify a large uplift. One nuance not emphasized: the resolution allows checking “on or after July 1,” so posting lag is unlikely to lower odds; the binding constraint is occurrence and NUFORC pilot tagging, not timing. Overall, their reasoning reinforces a low single-digit probability and suggests my prior 6% was a bit high relative to the base rate.",
    "rationale": "I initially set 6% to reflect an active 2025 pipeline (a Jan Rwanda pilot report) and the permissive resolution timing. The deliberation reinforced that the historical monthly chance from Africa is closer to 3–5%, and there’s no concrete evidence of increased African pilot reporting beyond the one January case. Given that, and accounting for possible year-to-year overdispersion but no specific June catalysts, I’m trimming to the top of the base-rate range rather than above it. I would move higher if late-May/June produced credible media or NUFORC-adjacent signals of a pilot sighting in Africa, or if multiple 2025 Africa pilot-tagged reports appeared. I would move lower if NUFORC tagging practices change or if data clarifies that 2015–2024 had only four Africa pilot reports rather than six (pushing the monthly rate toward ~3%).",
