    "review": "My initial forecast of 48% was critically flawed. I fell into the trap of analyzing who would win the fight, largely ignoring the primary condition of the question: that the fight must happen specifically at UFC 316. The other forecasters correctly identified this as the main driver of uncertainty. Both used a decomposition model: P(Yes) = P(Fight Happens) × P(Walker Wins | Fight Happens). Forecaster 3's argument about the very low base rate of any specific, unannounced fight materializing on a particular card months in advance was particularly compelling and something I had almost completely overlooked. Their structured, probabilistic reasoning exposed the weakness in my initial, more narrative-based analysis. Their analyses convinced me to completely re-evaluate my approach and drastically lower my forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I have significantly updated my analysis. My initial forecast was far too high because it failed to properly account for the high probability that the fight between Johnny Walker and Azamat Murzakanov does not take place at UFC 316 as specified. The resolution criteria make this the most important variable.\n\nFollowing the superior methodology of the other forecasters, I will decompose the problem:\n\n1.  **Probability the fight occurs at UFC 316:** The research assistant found 'no additional information', meaning there's no official booking. While a UFC Stats page exists, this is not a confirmation and could be a placeholder. Given the many variables in UFC matchmaking (injuries, other opponents, timing) and the long lead time, the odds of this specific pairing happening on this specific card are low. Forecaster 3's estimate of 10-15% seems most realistic. I will use a slightly more optimistic 20%, granting some weight to the existence of the stats page suggesting it might be under consideration.\n\n2.  **Probability Walker wins, conditional on the fight happening:** I am revising my view on the matchup itself. While I initially favored Walker's physical advantages, his history of volatility and knockout losses cannot be ignored against an undefeated power puncher like Murzakanov. The other forecasters' assessment of this being a 'coin-flip' (Forecaster 2) or slightly favoring Murzakanov (Forecaster 3) is persuasive. A 50% probability for Walker winning seems like a reasonable estimate for such a volatile clash of styles.\n\nTherefore, my updated forecast is the product of these two probabilities: 0.20 (for the fight happening) × 0.50 (for Walker winning) = 0.10. This is a significant decrease from 48%, reflecting a necessary correction based on a more rigorous analysis of the question's explicit conditions.",
