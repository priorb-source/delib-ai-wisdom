    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks (roughly 38 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US-Israel FTA remains in force and the HTS continues to show IL (Israel) special rates—mostly Free—without any country-wide 17% listing. No new Chapter 99 provision or HTS modification imposing a 17% ad valorem duty on products of Israel appears by June 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The White House/USTR announces and implements, before June 1, 2025, a new country-specific tariff on products of Israel (e.g., via a Presidential Proclamation under Section 232/301 or emergency authorities), and USITC publishes an HTS update that, when viewed on June 1, shows a 17% duty rate specifically for Israel (either as a special rate for IL or as an additional Chapter 99 duty applying to products of Israel).",
    "rationale": "- Time frame: Only ~5 weeks remain. Major country-wide tariff changes typically involve investigations, notice-and-comment, Federal Register notices, and HTS amendments—usually months, not weeks.\n- Status quo: The US-Israel FTA has long provided preferential (often duty-free) rates for IL in the HTS. The current HTS does not list a flat 17% rate for Israel; rates are per subheading, and IL is usually Free.\n- Policy/precedent: Recent broad, country-targeted tariffs (e.g., Section 301 on China; Section 232 on metals) use 10–25% rates and lengthy processes. A sudden, across-the-board, Israel-specific 17% rate would be unprecedented and politically significant, with no current public process indicating imminence.\n- Evidence check: As of Apr 24, 2025, there are no credible US government announcements, USTR investigations, or USITC HTS revision notices pointing to a 17% Israel-specific tariff. The referenced Times of Israel article signals concern but no confirmed US action.\n- Why not higher: Very short lead time; no visible legal process; high political cost; unusual rate choice (17%); HTS country-wide changes are rare and publicized.\n- Why not lower: Non-zero tail risk exists (e.g., emergency action leading to a Chapter 99 additional duty entry at 17%), or a narrowly scoped IL-specific rate on a major subheading that could be interpreted as meeting the resolution if the resolver targets that subheading; however, both are unlikely.\n- What would move me up: Official USTR/White House notice of intent to impose Israel-specific tariffs; a Federal Register notice proposing or finalizing a 17% Israel duty; USITC posting draft HTS modifications adding an Israel-specific 17% rate (especially in Chapter 99) effective by June 1, 2025.\n- What would move me down: Continued absence of any such notices through mid-May; explicit public statements ruling out tariff actions; or USITC/HTS update schedules showing no modifications before June 1.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information available; thus no evidence to counter the status quo weighting.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Israel as 17% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of Israel: [Israeli exports to US will take annual $2.3B hit under tariffs, industrial org warns](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-exports-to-us-will-take-2-3-billion-hit-under-tariffs-industrialist-org-warns/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 17% for Israel at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=israel) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
