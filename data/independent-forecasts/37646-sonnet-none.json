    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks (from May 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - Somalia is not currently listed as 'Available' on the Starlink Availability Map",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the license announcement, Starlink faces deployment delays due to infrastructure requirements, security concerns in Somalia, bureaucratic processes, or technical challenges. The company prioritizes other markets or the timeline from licensing to actual service availability extends beyond July 1st.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink rapidly deploys service following the license approval. With ground infrastructure already prepared or quickly established, and Musk's personal announcement signaling priority status, Somalia appears as 'Available' on the map within the 6.5-week window.",
    "rationale": "The license announcement is a significant positive signal - regulatory approval is typically the major bottleneck for Starlink expansion. Musk's personal announcement suggests this may be prioritized. However, several factors counsel caution: First, there's often a lag between license approval and actual service availability. 'Available' on Starlink's map means customers can order and receive service, not just regulatory clearance. Second, Somalia presents unique operational challenges including security concerns and infrastructure limitations that could slow deployment. Third, without knowing when exactly the license was granted or whether ground stations are prepared, the timeline is uncertain. The research assistant provided no additional details about deployment readiness or historical timelines for similar markets. A 6.5-week window is tight but not impossible for Starlink's rapid deployment capabilities. For my forecast to increase, I would need evidence of: ground station construction/preparation, customer pre-orders being accepted, or statements about imminent launch dates. For it to decrease, I would need reports of deployment delays, security incidents, or Starlink focusing resources elsewhere. Applying appropriate weight to status quo (service not yet available) while acknowledging the strong signal from the license announcement, I estimate moderate probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Somalia as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Musk announces Starlink license for Somalia](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Musk_announces_Starlink_license_for_Somalia_999.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Somalia listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
