    "review": "Forecaster 2 reinforces the short timeline and the need for an explicit ITKF announcement, which aligns with my prior concerns; their emphasis on bureaucratic lag even after a decision is a key constraint. Forecaster 3 adds a new and important argument: ITKF host awards are typically made 24–36 months out, implying we’re late relative to precedent. While I can’t independently verify that timeline here, it’s directionally plausible and, combined with the lack of any visible ITKF process signals (meeting agenda, shortlist, teasers), it lowers the chance of a pre–July 1 public announcement. Both also correctly note that high-level support and Egypt’s strong hosting track record keep the chance from collapsing because a small federation could still move quickly if the field is thin. Overall, I find the added emphasis on announcement timing and communications cadence convincing and it should pull my estimate down modestly.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~7 weeks. The default is no announcement. Positive signals: minister-level push; ITKF president’s favorable comments; Egypt’s proven capacity and government backing; short lead time to 2026 could incentivize earlier selection. Offsetting factors: the question requires an official ITKF announcement (not local press); small federations often tie selection to congresses or major events, making a pre–July 1 announcement less likely; communications can lag even after decisions; and (per Forecaster 3) historical host-award timing may be earlier than where we are now, suggesting we’re late in the cycle. With no public signs of an imminent ITKF vote or meeting and no teasers from ITKF channels, the path to Yes likely requires an executive decision and prompt comms in May/June. That is plausible but not the base case. Given the added timing argument and announcement requirement, I’m nudging my forecast down from 38% to 30%.",
