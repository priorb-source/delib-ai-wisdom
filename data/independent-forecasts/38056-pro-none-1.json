    "no_outcome_scenario": "Azamat Murzakanov wins the fight by knockout, submission, or decision. An alternative scenario resolving to 'No' involves the fight being cancelled for any reason, such as injury or a missed weight cut, and Walker not competing at the event.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Johnny Walker defeats Azamat Murzakanov at UFC 316. The method of victory could be knockout, submission, or a judge's decision.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is based on a stylistic and statistical analysis of both fighters. The status quo is that this scheduled bout will take place. The primary factor favoring Johnny Walker is his significant physical advantage: at 6'6\" with an 82-inch reach, he towers over the 5'10\" Murzakanov and possesses a massive 11-inch reach advantage. His path to victory relies on using this length to control the distance with kicks and long punches, keeping the powerful Murzakanov at bay. Walker has also faced a higher caliber of opponents, albeit with mixed results. Conversely, Azamat Murzakanov holds an undefeated 13-0 record and possesses significant knockout power. His success hinges on his ability to close the distance, get inside Walker's reach, and land a fight-altering shot. My probability is not higher than 55% due to Walker's demonstrated vulnerabilities, specifically a questionable chin (he has been knocked out multiple times) and inconsistent fight IQ. Murzakanov's undefeated record and power make him a very dangerous opponent with a clear path to victory. The probability is not lower because Walker's unique physical attributes and explosive, unorthodox striking style present a challenge that Murzakanov has not previously faced. If Walker can fight a disciplined, technical fight from the outside, he has a clear advantage and more ways to win. My confidence in a 'Yes' outcome would increase with reports of a focused, disciplined training camp for Walker. Conversely, any news of injury or a poor weight cut for Walker would cause me to lower this forecast.",
