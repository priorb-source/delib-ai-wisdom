    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses align closely with mine, with all three of us converging on 77-82%. This convergence itself is informative - it suggests we're weighing the evidence similarly and the forecast range is well-calibrated. Forecaster 2 made a particularly strong point I hadn't emphasized enough: 'follow-up discussions after the Istanbul meeting will almost certainly be needed regardless of the outcome.' Whether the May 15 talks succeed, fail, or produce partial progress, Trump and Zelenskyy will likely need to coordinate on next steps. This is compelling because it creates multiple pathways to a phone call even beyond the immediate pre-Istanbul period. Forecaster 2 also effectively highlighted their 'differing positions on preconditions' as a catalyst for continued direct communication. Forecaster 3's caution about the 'very recent call potentially reducing immediate need' is valid but somewhat mitigated by the 33-day window - even a 2-3 week gap would still fit comfortably within our timeframe. None of the forecasters introduced dramatically new evidence that would warrant a major shift, but the emphasis on post-Istanbul communication needs is persuasive.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating slightly upward to 79% based primarily on the post-Istanbul follow-up argument. The May 15 talks create a natural inflection point that will require follow-up communication between the principals. The established pattern of roughly monthly contact, the 33-day window, and the active diplomatic situation all support a high probability. While the May 10 call was recent, the timeframe is long enough that waiting 2-3 weeks for another call would still leave them well within the resolution period. The convergence of all three forecasters at 77-82% increases my confidence that this range accurately reflects the balance of evidence. My slight upward adjustment acknowledges the strength of the post-Istanbul coordination argument while maintaining appropriate caution about alternative communication channels and the possibility of in-person meetings.",
