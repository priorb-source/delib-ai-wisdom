  "information": "A proposal to ban the 'Tush Push' play, initially submitted by the Green Bay Packers, was discussed at the NFL's annual meeting in early April 2025. The proposal was tabled after receiving support from 16 of the NFL's 32 teams, short of the 24 votes required to pass a rule change. The proposal is scheduled to be revisited at the spring league meeting on May 20-21, 2025, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nMultiple reports indicate that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell favors the ban. Goodell has stated that the play 'feels more like rugby' than football and that returning to pre-2005 rules that banned pushing players 'makes a lot of sense.' The NFL league office also reportedly wants to eliminate the play. Additionally, the NFL's Competition Committee and health and safety officials, including Dr. Allen Sills, have expressed concerns about the play's potential for injury.\n\nThe original proposal is being reworked into a broader rule that would prohibit pushing or pulling a ball carrier anywhere on the field, not just in the specific quarterback sneak formation. This change aims to frame the issue around general football principles rather than targeting a specific team. On the other hand, the NFL's health and safety department possesses no data indicating any injuries have occurred from the 'Tush Push'. The Philadelphia Eagles, who have used the play with a high success rate, have vocally opposed the ban.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than three weeks. The resolution window closes on June 1, 2025, and the key vote is scheduled for the NFL's spring league meeting on May 20-21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The 'Tush-Push' is currently a legal play and an initial vote to ban it did not pass.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The reworked proposal to ban pushing a ball carrier fails to secure the necessary 24 votes at the May 20-21 owners meeting. Opponents successfully argue that the lack of injury data does not justify a rule change, and the status quo is maintained through the June 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At the May 20-21 meeting, the league office's lobbying and the broader framing of the rule succeed in swaying at least eight additional owners. The proposal receives 24 or more votes, and the NFL officially announces a new rule restricting the play before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "While the status quo is that the play is legal and the initial vote failed, significant momentum exists to ban the play. The most compelling factors are the strong public support from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and the league office, which rarely fail to achieve their desired outcomes on rule changes. The initial proposal already had the support of half the league's teams (16 of 32), providing a strong foundation to build from. The strategic decision to reframe the proposal from a specific 'Tush-Push' ban to a general prohibition on pushing any ball carrier is likely to attract the eight additional votes needed. This reframing de-escalates the perception that the rule targets a specific team (the Philadelphia Eagles) and recasts it as a matter of general football principles, which Goodell has referred to as getting away from a 'rugby'-style play. My forecast is not higher because a 75% majority (24 votes) is a high threshold, and the strongest argument against the ban — the lack of concrete injury data from the league's own health officials — remains a powerful tool for opponents. My forecast is not lower because the combined influence of the Commissioner, the Competition Committee, and a shrewder, reframed proposal creates a clear and probable path to passage at the upcoming meeting. I would increase my forecast if influential owners or the NFLPA publicly endorsed the ban. I would decrease it if reports emerged that support among owners was weakening despite the league's efforts.",
