    "review": "Both forecasters align with my view: short horizon, high threshold, and no observable preparations for a landing. They add two useful emphases: (1) the historical base rate—no PLA landings on Taiwan-held territory since the 1950s—supports a very low near-term probability; and (2) U.S. language calibration risk even if a limited outlying-island seizure occurred, meaning the resolution bar (a public U.S. accusation of “invasion” via ground forces) might not be met. Their triggers for moving up or down match mine. I find their reasoning convincing and consistent with my prior.",
    "rationale": "The key drivers remain unchanged: roughly eight weeks left; invasion-by-ground-forces is an exceptionally escalatory, high-visibility action that would likely generate detectable mobilization signals, which are absent in open sources; and the repeatedly cited 2027 PLA readiness timeline shifts risk mass outside this window. Elevated gray-zone activity and coercive exercises do not satisfy resolution, and the CFR’s “moderately likely” crisis framing does not necessarily imply a ground landing.\n\nTail-risk scenarios persist—most plausibly a limited fait accompli against a lightly defended outlying island (e.g., Pratas/Dongsha or parts of Kinmen/Matsu) or an accident-turned-crisis that escalates quickly. Even then, the U.S. might characterize events as a “seizure” or “attack” rather than explicitly as an “invasion,” slightly reducing the conditional probability that the resolution criterion is met. A rough decomposition remains: P(PLA ground landing on Taiwan-held territory before July 1) on the order of low single digits, multiplied by P(U.S. publicly labels it as an invasion) less than 1, yielding an overall probability around 2%.\n\nUpside movers: clear amphibious/airborne mobilization (massing landing ships/RO-ROs, large exclusion zones, evacuation advisories, legal/political wartime steps in PRC), allied evacuations, U.S. carrier/amphibious deployments signaling imminent crisis, and specific intelligence leaks. Downside movers: visible de-escalation and dispersed PLA posture, resumed mil-to-mil dialogue, or stabilizing diplomatic signals.\n\nGiven consensus assessments and no new indicators, I do not update off 2%.",
