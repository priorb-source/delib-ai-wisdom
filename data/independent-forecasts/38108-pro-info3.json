  "information": "Multiple external analyses and news reports have questioned the accuracy of DOGE's savings claims. A report by watchdog group Open The Books found that only 42% of the terminated contracts and 27% of the grants cited by DOGE could be publicly tracked. Media investigations, including one by The New York Times, have alleged numerous errors in DOGE's accounting, such as double-counting, including contracts that had already expired, and taking credit for 'zombie contracts' that never existed. An estimate by The Atlantic suggested actual verified savings may only amount to $2 billion. Furthermore, a CNN analysis projected that the effort could ultimately cost the government $135 billion due to the expense of retraining and rehiring workers who were let go.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "DOGE continues to publish large savings figures that are heavily scrutinized by outside groups. However, the intensity of the criticism and the risk of a major political scandal over fraudulent numbers cause them to temper their final claim, publishing a figure just shy of the $200 billion mark.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Intensified media scrutiny and the threat of a formal investigation by a government watchdog, like the GAO, force DOGE to adopt more conservative accounting in the final weeks. They announce a large but more defensible number, such as $175 billion, to mitigate political damage, and the figure on their website remains below $200 billion on July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by political imperatives to demonstrate success, DOGE's leadership ignores external criticism and continues its aggressive accounting practices. They purposefully ensure the total claimed savings figure on their website crosses the $200 billion threshold by the deadline to declare a major victory, calculating that the positive headline will outweigh the detailed critiques of their methodology.",
    "rationale": "My forecast hinges on the specific resolution criteria: the outcome is determined by what DOGE *claims* on its website, not the actual, verified savings. This transforms the question from one of economic reality to one of political strategy.\n\nThe research indicates two opposing forces. The primary incentive for DOGE is to claim a large, politically impressive number to justify its existence and deliver a win for its proponents. A target like $200 billion is a powerful, round number. The evidence provided, detailing DOGE's use of 'double-counting' and 'zombie contracts', strongly suggests they are willing to use questionable accounting to maximize their claimed savings. \n\nHowever, a significant countervailing force exists: the intense public scrutiny from media outlets like The New York Times and CNN, and watchdog groups like Open The Books. Claiming an easily discredited number risks a major political scandal. \n\nI weigh the political incentive to claim a big number as slightly stronger than the risk of scandal. The department is already embroiled in controversy over its methods; it is likely they will choose to weather more criticism in exchange for a huge headline number. The resolution date is only a month away, making a significant, credibility-saving reversal of their accounting methodology unlikely. \n\nMy probability is not higher (e.g., >75%) because the risk of scandal is real and could trigger a political decision to claim a more modest, defensible figure just below the $200 billion threshold. A particularly damaging exposé in the coming weeks could force their hand.\n\nMy probability is not lower (e.g., <50%) because DOGE has full control over the number it posts, and the evidence shows it is already employing the aggressive accounting necessary to reach such a high figure. Failing to produce a spectacular number would be a political failure in itself. \n\nI would increase my forecast if prominent political backers of DOGE begin to publicly tout the '$200 billion saved' figure. I would decrease it if a government body like the GAO were to announce a formal audit before the resolution date.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Doge claim a total savings of $200 billion or more on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Tech guru admired by Elon Musk estimates ‘over $100 billion’ in taxpayer money is being wasted or stolen](https://nypost.com/2025/02/25/us-news/tech-guru-admired-by-elon-musk-estimates-over-100-billion-in-taxpayer-money-is-being-wasted-or-stolen/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
