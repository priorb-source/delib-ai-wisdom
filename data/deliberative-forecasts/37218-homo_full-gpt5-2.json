    "review": "New and relevant points from the other forecasters: (1) Canadian inadmissibility risk due to Trump’s 2024 felony convictions, implying need for a Temporary Resident Permit; I hadn’t explicitly incorporated this gating factor. (2) Extra complexity if he is the sitting president in 2025 for a purely leisure trip abroad. (3) Lack of leaks or promo hints 12 days out as a negative signal. I find these arguments directionally persuasive. I temper the inadmissibility point somewhat because Canada could likely expedite a TRP for a head of state if he wanted to come, but it remains real friction that must be proactively solved. Rogan’s absence is a minor factor but consistent with a lower draw. Overall, these inputs nudge me slightly downward.",
    "rationale": "Status quo still favors non-attendance: Trump’s pattern is 2–4 domestic UFC events per year, with no precedent for him attending an international UFC card; UFC 315 is in Montreal; the card is solid but not an exceptional must-see for him; and he just attended Miami four weeks prior, a cadence he rarely repeats. The additional immigration/entry hurdle (TRP) and the higher security/diplomatic coordination burden for a foreign leisure visit as a sitting president add meaningful friction. With only ~12 days left and no credible signals (travel planning leaks, Canadian security coordination reports, UFC/Dana White hints), the default remains No. Countervailing factors (Dana White relationship, Trump’s penchant for surprise appearances, ability to secure expedited entry if desired) keep the probability above a floor but do not outweigh the frictions. I slightly lower my estimate to reflect the explicit TRP constraint and lack of lead-time signals. Up-movers: credible reporting of a TRP/clearance, hints from Trump or Dana White, RCMP/venue security prep leaks, or flight activity toward Montreal. Down-movers: confirmed conflicting commitments on May 10, explicit denials, or reports placing him elsewhere that evening.",
