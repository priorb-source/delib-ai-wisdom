  "information": "Airlines increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025. Jet2.com announced it would offer 1.6 million seats for the summer season, an 8% increase from 2024, with new routes from Bournemouth and London-Luton starting in April. Vueling offered over 145,000 seats to and from the islands for the Easter period, a 10% increase from the previous year. Air Nostrum increased its seat offerings by 7% for the same period. Binter also launched new routes from Córdoba to Gran Canaria starting in mid-April 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. The outcome will be known in early June 2025 when the April 2025 passenger arrival data is published on the Canary Islands Tourism Research site.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - passenger arrivals would remain stable or increase compared to April 2024",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The significant capacity increases by multiple airlines (Jet2.com +8%, Vueling +10%, Air Nostrum +7%, plus new Binter routes) translate into actual passenger growth. Strong European demand, particularly from the UK and Germany which represent the majority of tourism to the Canaries, continues. Easter timing and spring break travel patterns favor April 2025. The Trump tariff concerns prove to have minimal impact since US tourists represent a small minority of total arrivals to the Canary Islands.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite increased airline capacity, actual bookings were significantly weaker than anticipated. A combination of economic concerns in key European markets, the Trump tariff effects creating broader uncertainty affecting travel spending, unfavorable weather conditions in April 2025, or an unusually strong April 2024 baseline creating a difficult comparison. Airlines' forward capacity planning proves to have been overly optimistic.",
    "rationale": "Several factors strongly point toward a No outcome (no decline). Multiple major airlines substantially increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025, with increases ranging from 7-10%. Airlines make these capacity decisions based on forward bookings and market analysis months in advance, suggesting demand was expected to be strong. The fact that these increases were implemented and new routes launched indicates confidence in the market. The Trump tariff concerns mentioned in the article would primarily affect US tourists, who constitute a small minority of Canary Islands visitors compared to European tourists, particularly from the UK, Germany, and Spain. The status quo bias is important here - year-over-year declines in established tourism markets are relatively rare without major disruptions like pandemics, wars, or natural disasters, none of which appear to have occurred. The February 2025 data cited in the question showed growth over February 2024, establishing a pattern of continued growth. However, I'm not assigning an even lower probability for several reasons: The Trump policy concerns are real and could have broader psychological effects on travel spending beyond just US tourists. The article specifically mentions concerns about consequences to Canary Islands tourism. We don't have the actual April 2024 baseline number - if it was an exceptionally strong month, decline becomes more possible. Economic uncertainty in Europe could have dampened demand. Airline capacity doesn't guarantee passenger loads if bookings weakened closer to travel dates. To move my forecast higher (toward Yes), I would need evidence of: significant booking cancellations in March-April 2025, reports of lower hotel occupancy, economic crisis in key European markets, or data showing April 2024 was exceptionally strong. To move lower (toward No), I would need: confirmation of strong forward bookings materializing, positive reports from tourism operators, or data showing continued growth trends through Q1 2025.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAirlines increased their capacity to the Canary Islands for spring 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
