    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Labour party, having won a significant majority in the 2024 general election, will maintain a comfortable, albeit likely reduced, lead in the polls over Reform UK. The gap will not close to the point where Reform leads by 4 points.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Labour government's post-election honeymoon period erodes but does not end catastrophically. Their polling numbers stabilize above 35%. While Reform UK solidifies its position as the second party, its growth stalls as it hits a ceiling of support, failing to attract voters beyond its core base of ex-Conservatives. The Conservatives manage to halt their complete collapse, retaining enough support to prevent a total consolidation of the right-wing vote under Reform. Consequently, Reform UK never surpasses Labour in the polling averages.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major political or economic crisis severely damages the credibility of the new Labour government, causing its support to plummet rapidly. Simultaneously, the Conservative Party's internal conflicts lead to a final, definitive collapse, with the vast majority of its remaining voters switching allegiance to Reform UK. Nigel Farage capitalizes on the government's troubles with a highly effective populist campaign, allowing Reform to surge past a weakened Labour Party and establish a lead of 4 points or more in the Politico Poll of Polls.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high degree of political inertia and the significant hurdles Reform UK faces to achieve this outcome. The central factor is the status quo: as of May 2025, the Labour Party is less than a year into its term after a presumed landslide victory in 2024. Historically, new governments, even when facing challenges, do not see their support collapse so dramatically in such a short period. For Reform to not only overtake Labour but to establish a 4-point lead in a poll-of-polls (which smooths out outlier results) would require an unprecedented political realignment in just two months. This would necessitate both a catastrophic failure for the Labour government and the near-total absorption of the remaining Conservative vote by Reform. While Reform's rise has been a major story, displacing a new majority government in the polls is a monumental task. The 4-point lead condition adds a further layer of difficulty. The probability is not lower because the political landscape is highly volatile following the 2024 election. The Conservative party's weakness creates a political vacuum on the right that Reform, under a skilled campaigner like Nigel Farage, is well-positioned to exploit. A major unforeseen event or a significant government blunder could accelerate this trend beyond current expectations. My forecast would increase if several polls in May show the gap between Labour and Reform narrowing to low single digits, or if a major scandal erupts within the Labour government. Conversely, my forecast would decrease if Labour's poll numbers stabilize or if the Conservative party begins to show signs of a modest recovery.",
