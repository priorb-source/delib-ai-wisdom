  "information": "In March 2025, Anthropic raised approximately $3.5 billion in a funding round that valued the company at around $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion a year prior. Key investors in this and other recent rounds include Amazon (access to $8 billion), Google (over $3 billion invested), Lightspeed Venture Partners, Salesforce Ventures, and Fidelity Management & Research Co. Analysts have noted that the company's access to deep private funding from strategic partners lowers its immediate need for capital.\n\nAnthropic has recently launched its Claude 3.7 Sonnet model and is reportedly developing new features, including a two-way voice assistant and enhanced memory functions for its AI. The company announced a five-year, $100 million partnership with Databricks to develop corporate AI agents. Concurrently, Anthropic is expanding its operations into the Asia-Pacific region, with plans to establish an office in Korea.\n\nThe typical process for an initial public offering of this size involves preparatory steps that have not been publicly observed for Anthropic. There have been no reports or leaks to major financial news outlets like Reuters, the Wall Street Journal, or Bloomberg about the company hiring investment banks or filing a confidential S-1 form. Among U.S. venture-backed companies valued at over $10 billion (decacorns), the base rate for going public is approximately one to two companies per year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Anthropic remains a privately-held company and does not announce plans for an IPO.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic's management continues to leverage its substantial private funding from strategic investors like Amazon and Google to finance its operations and growth. They decide that the benefits of going public do not outweigh the costs of regulatory scrutiny, market volatility, and management distraction at this time. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an S-1 filing or an official announcement on their website.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by a desire to provide liquidity for early investors and employees, or to capitalize on a perceived optimal market window for AI stocks, Anthropic's board makes a swift decision to go public. Having secretly prepared, the company either files a public Form S-1 with the SEC or posts an official IPO announcement in the news section of its website before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily favors a 'No' outcome, primarily due to three factors: Anthropic's strong private funding, the extremely short timeline, and the absence of any public signals of IPO preparation. The research report highlights that Anthropic has access to billions in capital from strategic partners like Amazon and Google, significantly reducing any immediate need to raise funds via public markets. An IPO is a lengthy and complex process, and with only a month and a half until the deadline, it is highly improbable for the company to initiate and announce such a move without prior groundwork. Crucially, as the report notes, there have been no leaks or reports of Anthropic hiring investment banks or confidentially filing an S-1, which are typical precursors to a major IPO. The base rate for venture-backed 'decacorns' going public is also very low, further supporting the status quo. The primary argument for a 'Yes' outcome would be a surprise strategic shift to capitalize on market enthusiasm, but this is speculative and lacks evidence. My probability is not lower than 2% to account for the small possibility that the company has been preparing in complete secrecy and chooses to act opportunistically within the short timeframe. It is not higher because the available evidence points overwhelmingly towards the company remaining private in the near term. I would increase my forecast significantly if credible reports emerged about Anthropic hiring underwriters or filing a confidential S-1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn March 2025, Anthropic raised approximately $3.5 billion in a funding round that valued the company at around $61.5 billion, up from $16 billion a year prior.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
