  "information": "According to multiple news reports from early June 2025, the White House has officially confirmed that US President Donald Trump will attend the NATO summit in The Hague. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated, 'I can confirm that Trump will attend the NATO summit.' This confirmation was also echoed by officials from allied nations. Dutch Prime Minister Dik Scoh announced Trump's intention to attend following a phone call between the two leaders. Similarly, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski stated that Trump had reaffirmed his commitment to the alliance and would be present at the summit.\n\nA primary focus of the summit will be defense spending among NATO members. President Trump has been advocating for member countries to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, a significant increase from the current 2% target. In response to this pressure, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte (or Jens Stoltenberg, sources vary) has reportedly proposed a compromise deal: a target of 3.5% of GDP on direct defense spending by 2032, with an additional 1.5% allocated for broader security-related expenditures. The discussions will also address military aid to Ukraine, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to attend.\n\nThe NATO summit is scheduled to take place from June 24 to June 26, 2025, at the World Forum in The Hague, Netherlands. This will be the first time the Netherlands has hosted a NATO summit. Over 6,000 delegates and 2,000 journalists from 32 NATO member countries and partner nations are expected to be in attendance. President Trump's schedule for June 2025 also includes other high-profile international travel, such as his attendance at the G7 leaders' summit in Kananaskis, Canada, from June 15 to 17.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 20–22 days (summit June 24–26, 2025; will resolve no later than June 26)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Trump attends in person at least one session of the NATO Summit in The Hague",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Last‑minute cancellation or substitution due to an acute health issue, an urgent domestic or international crisis that keeps him in Washington, a deliberate boycott/change of plan to pressure allies, a major security disruption forcing postponement, or he sends a surrogate (e.g., VP or SecState) instead",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He travels to The Hague and participates in at least one in‑person plenary or bilateral meeting during June 24–26, even briefly, satisfying the “same physical space” criterion",
    "rationale": "- Signals: Multiple early‑June reports (per the research assistant) say the White House has officially confirmed Trump will attend, echoed by allied officials. That is a strong indicator given the short lead time.\n- Base rates: Sitting U.S. presidents almost always attend NATO summits; Trump attended past NATO summits as president. Attendance confers leverage for his defense‑spending agenda, which current reporting says he is actively pushing.\n- Timing: We are ~3 weeks out. At this horizon, with formal confirmation, the modal outcome is attendance. Logistics and bilateral schedules are typically locked in.\n- Risks keeping the probability below certainty: Trump’s unpredictability; small but non‑zero health risk for a 79‑year‑old; potential urgent crises (domestic or international) that could anchor him in Washington; very low‑probability security or travel disruptions; or a tactical no‑show to increase pressure on allies. The research assistant’s minor inconsistencies (e.g., on SecGen identity, G7 location) also warrant a small discount on the strength of the reporting, though they don’t undermine the core claim of a White House confirmation.\n- Why not higher: Aggregate of tail risks above (perhaps 8–10% total) and Trump’s history of abrupt schedule changes.\n- Why not lower: Official confirmation, strong precedent, and clear policy incentives to attend; the cost of skipping a head‑of‑state NATO summit is high.\n- What would move me up: Release of a detailed presidential schedule and bilateral list for The Hague; visible pre‑positioning/logistics; wheels‑up reports or arrival in Europe; on‑record confirmations from both the White House and Dutch/NATO hosts with specific timings.\n- What would move me down: Credible reports of health issues; an acute crisis requiring his presence in D.C.; indications he will send a surrogate; threats to skip from Trump himself; credible security concerns or postponement chatter.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
