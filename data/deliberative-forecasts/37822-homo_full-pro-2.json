    "review": "My initial analysis, which matched Forecaster 2's, focused on the central conflict between Beto O'Rourke's history of early campaign announcements and the current lack of any visible campaign infrastructure. Both of us concluded that the lack of concrete preparatory steps was a stronger signal than his past behavior, leading to a 40% forecast. Forecaster 3, however, raised a crucial strategic point I hadn't sufficiently weighed: the divisive Republican primary between John Cornyn and Ken Paxton creates a tangible opportunity and a strong incentive for a Democratic candidate to announce early. This allows them to consolidate support and fundraising while the opposition is engaged in a potentially damaging internal fight. I found this argument highly convincing as it provides a compelling strategic rationale for the timing, beyond simple historical precedent.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast based on the compelling strategic argument raised by Forecaster 3. My initial 40% forecast was based on the view that the lack of observable campaign preparations (no FEC filings, no exploratory committee) in late May was a strong indicator that an announcement before July 1 was unlikely, despite O'Rourke's history. However, Forecaster 3's point that the messy Republican primary creates a clear strategic window for an early Democratic entry effectively strengthens the case for 'Yes'. This strategic imperative, when combined with O'Rourke's established pattern of announcing 12-20 months before an election (the July 1 deadline is 16 months out), now makes an imminent announcement slightly more probable than not. The lack of visible infrastructure remains a significant point of concern and prevents a more confident forecast, but a well-known candidate like O'Rourke with an existing political network could launch a campaign relatively quickly. The strategic logic for moving now has persuaded me to shift my probability to just over 50%.",
