    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds useful granularity on recent prints (Feb −0.7%, Mar −0.1%, Apr −0.1%), core CPI (~+0.5%), and emphasizes May Day services seasonality and pork as the swing factor. That strengthens the case that the outcome is close to the zero line and that a small positive headline is plausible. However, I think they underweight the persistence of food and energy drags and the weak macro backdrop. Forecaster 3’s argument is closer to my view: component-level checks (energy still likely negative YoY despite Brent being up YoY, pork prices still weak on high inventories) and macro context (weak demand, property stress) support another slight negative. I’m cautious about the claimed mid-May RRR cut, but even if true, it wouldn’t affect May CPI materially. Net, Forecaster 3’s reasoning reinforces my base case; Forecaster 2 reminds me to keep the probability close to the midline due to holiday services and core being positive.",
    "rationale": "Resolution requires May 2025 CPI YoY (FRED CHNCPIALLMINMEI) to be negative. The last three readings were negative and narrowing (−0.7, −0.1, −0.1). High-frequency macro signals for May (manufacturing PMI 49.5, soft non-manufacturing, further property sales decline) point to ongoing weak domestic demand. Core services likely firmed around the May Day holiday, but headline remains sensitive to food and energy: pork’s YoY remains the key swing factor and likely stayed negative given high inventories, and domestic energy prices probably remained negative YoY even with Brent slightly higher YoY. That combination makes another small negative headline slightly more likely than a flip to positive, though it’s a near-50/50 call because core is modestly positive and holiday services could nudge the aggregate up. I’m nudging my probability up modestly from 62% to 65% based on the added component-level arguments that food and energy likely stayed in negative territory, while still respecting the proximity to zero and seasonal services firmness.",
