  "information": "The competition in Ballerini's nominated categories includes several artists with more nominations. In the Entertainer of the Year category, she is competing against Luke Combs, Chris Stapleton, Jelly Roll, Lainey Wilson, Cody Johnson, and Morgan Wallen. In the Female Artist of the Year category, her competitors include Ella Langley, Kacey Musgraves, Lainey Wilson, and Megan Moroney. Ella Langley leads with eight total nominations, and Lainey Wilson, the reigning Entertainer of the Year, has seven.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days until May 8, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Kelsea Ballerini does not win any awards, as historically most nominees do not win in their categories",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ballerini's competition proves too strong across all three categories. In Entertainer of the Year, established stars like Luke Combs, Chris Stapleton, or defending champion Lainey Wilson take the award. In Female Artist of the Year, one of the other nominees with more total nominations (like Ella Langley with 8 or Lainey Wilson with 7) wins. Her third nomination also goes to another artist.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ballerini wins at least one of her three nominated categories. Most likely, she could win Female Artist of the Year if voters favor her body of work this year, or she could take one of her other nominations where competition may be less concentrated than Entertainer of the Year.",
    "rationale": "Ballerini has 3 nominations providing multiple opportunities to win. However, the competition is formidable. In Entertainer of the Year (7 nominees), she faces major stars and defending champion Lainey Wilson. In Female Artist of the Year (5 nominees), she competes against artists with significantly more total nominations - Ella Langley leads with 8, and Lainey Wilson has 7, compared to Ballerini's 3. With 3 chances, a naive base rate calculation (assuming 15% per category average) would suggest roughly 38% chance of winning at least one. However, the research indicates she's not favored in the named categories. ACM Awards typically spread recognition across multiple artists rather than concentrating wins, which works in her favor. Why not higher: She's clearly not the favorite in Entertainer (too many major stars) and appears to be an underdog in Female Artist given the nomination counts. Her modest 3 total nominations vs. leaders with 7-8 suggests the Academy may favor other artists this year. Why not lower: Three nominations provide meaningful chances, and upsets happen regularly at awards shows. Historical ACM data suggests artists with multiple nominations often win at least once. To revise upward, I'd need evidence of: strong critical/commercial momentum for Ballerini, insider predictions favoring her, or weakness in competitors. To revise downward: polling/prediction markets showing she's a clear underdog across all categories, or very strong late momentum for competitors.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
