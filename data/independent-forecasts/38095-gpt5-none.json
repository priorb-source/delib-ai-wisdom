    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The White House issues a batch of clemencies in June—e.g., a tranche for January 6 defendants, a group of white-collar or drug-offense commutations, or several high-profile ally pardons—bringing the total to 3 or more within the month. A publicly disclosed blanket action would also immediately satisfy the threshold.",
    "rationale": "- Framing and base rate: In most presidencies, clemency actions are lumpy—often clustered near holidays or term endings—and many months have zero. In Trump’s first term, multi-person months happened but were not routine outside late-2020/January 2021 bursts. Absent a clear signal of a June batch, the status quo (0–2 in a typical month) leans No.\n- Current context: Trump has signaled willingness to grant controversial clemencies (including for Jan 6 defendants) and is less constrained by norms. That raises the background risk of multi-person months. The Guardian piece (2025-05-02) discussing the cost of Trump’s white-collar pardons suggests notable recent activity and political attention, nudging the probability up from a pure base-rate prior. However, June is not a traditionally favored batch month, and political blowback could encourage spacing or deferral.\n- Threshold is low: Only three grants are needed. Even without a formal batch, a handful of discrete actions (e.g., a couple of high-profile allies plus one or more lower-profile commutations) could clear the bar.\n- Why not higher: There’s no specific reporting (per the research assistant: no additional information) indicating a planned June batch or blanket clemency. Historically, months with >2 grants are less common than months with ≤2, and without a known trigger, inertia favors No.\n- Why not lower: Trump’s demonstrated propensity to use clemency for allies and constituencies, combined with the small threshold and potential incentives to create June news (e.g., around major court decisions or symbolic dates), keeps the chance materially above a minimal base rate.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of a pending June clemency slate; signs of a blanket action (e.g., Jan 6 defendants) planned for June; leaks from the White House or DOJ indicating multiple recommendations queued for June.\n- What would move me down: Early-to-mid June passes with no actions and reporting suggests internal pushback or a decision to postpone batches until later (e.g., July 4 or year-end); explicit statements ruling out near-term batches.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump grant executive clemency to more than 2 individuals in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nGuardian: [Trump white-collar criminal pardons cost public $1bn, says ex-DoJ official](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/02/trump-pardons-cost-liz-oyer)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Donald J. Trump grants [executive clemency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_granted_executive_clemency_in_the_second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump) to greater than 2 individuals in June 2025.\n\nPartial pardons or clemencies count. They will only count if publicly disclosed. Wide-reaching blanket pardons or commutations also count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
