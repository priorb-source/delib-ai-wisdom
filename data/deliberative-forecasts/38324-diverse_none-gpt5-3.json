    "review": "Both forecasters rely almost entirely on extrapolating the recent upward trend in gross debt and implicitly assume there is no binding debt limit. Neither addresses the post–Jan 1, 2025 reinstatement of the debt ceiling under the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 and the well-documented effect of extraordinary measures on the Total Public Debt Outstanding series (Debt to the Penny). When the ceiling binds, Treasury offsets new issuance by reducing certain intragovernmental investments, keeping the reported gross debt roughly flat until Congress acts—often for months. In that regime, trend extrapolation is misleading. Claims like “~$37.8T as of June 4” are unlikely if the ceiling remains binding. I’d find their views more convincing with concrete, current Debt to the Penny data or confirmation that Congress already raised/suspended the limit well before June, plus evidence of a large catch-up and restoration already pushing debt near/above $37T.",
    "rationale": "Key consideration is mechanics, not inertia. The debt limit was reinstated at the start of 2025. If it remains binding, Total Public Debt Outstanding (the resolving series) typically plates near the reinstatement level due to extraordinary measures. Under that status quo, reaching ≥$37T by June 27 is unlikely. Crossing $37T in time would require: (1) Congress to lift/suspend the ceiling soon; and (2) the combination of immediate restorations (G Fund and other intragovernmental accounts) plus catch-up issuance between enactment and June 27 to be large enough to push the reported total above $37T. Historical restorations upon resolution have tended to be in the low-to-mid hundreds of billions, not $1T+. Given 23 days left, a late-June resolution likely leaves too little time to both restore and issue enough to clear $37T unless the starting level is already very close. \n\nScenarios: \n- Ceiling remains binding through June 27 (base case): debt stays near the Jan 2 level -> No. \n- Ceiling is lifted in mid/late June: restorations and some catch-up issuance occur, but likely not enough to move from mid–$35T to ≥$37T by June 27 -> probably still No. \n- Ceiling was already lifted earlier in spring and debt has been rising freely for months: could be ≥$37T by June 27 -> Yes. \n\nBecause the other forecasters provided no evidence of an already-resolved ceiling or current Debt to the Penny levels, I place higher weight on the first two scenarios. I would update sharply higher if we had verified Debt to the Penny data showing the total already ≥$36.8T, or credible confirmation that a debt-limit increase passed well before June with subsequent large restorations and issuance pushing the series near $37T.",
