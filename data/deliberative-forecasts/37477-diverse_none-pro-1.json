    "review": "My initial forecast of 70% was based on the strong intuition that over a 23-day period, the natural volatility of the news cycle would almost certainly produce one day where other events displaced 'tariff(s)' from the front pages of both the NYT and WSJ. The other forecasters presented compelling arguments that tempered this view.\n\nForecaster 2's analysis was strong, highlighting factors I had not explicitly detailed, such as the potential for news cycle disruption from the Memorial Day holiday and different editorial priorities for weekend editions. These points add texture to the argument for a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nHowever, Forecaster 3's analysis was the most impactful and convinced me to revise my estimate. Their key insight, which I had overlooked, was to treat the question's unresolved status as evidence. The fact that a 'Yes' day has not occurred since the question opened (likely mid-April) is strong data suggesting that the daily probability of a 'clean' day is very low. Framing the problem mathematically (P(Yes) = 1 - (1-p)^n) and using the implicit historical data to anchor the value of 'p' provides a much more rigorous foundation for a forecast. This observation serves as a powerful counterweight to my initial intuition.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downwards from 70% to 58%. The primary reason for this significant revision is the evidence implied by the question's history, as pointed out by Forecaster 3. My initial assessment did not account for the fact that for approximately three weeks prior to today, the word 'tariff(s)' has appeared on the front page of at least one of the two newspapers *every single day*. This is a strong signal of the topic's resilience and persistence in the top-tier news cycle.\n\nThis sustained daily presence suggests the base rate probability of a day occurring where both papers omit the word is much lower than I first assumed. Adopting Forecaster 3's probabilistic model, this historical data implies a daily 'clean day' probability ('p') in the low single digits (likely 3-4%). When projected over the remaining 22-day window, this leads to a cumulative probability in the 50-60% range, not the 70% I initially proposed.\n\nWhile I still believe the arguments from my initial analysis and from Forecaster 2 (news cycle volatility, the low threshold of only one required day, potential holiday effects) hold true and prevent the probability from dropping below 50%, the implicit evidence of the recent past cannot be ignored. The topic has demonstrated a staying power that makes a 22-day unbroken streak of 'No' days more plausible than I first judged. Therefore, I am adjusting my forecast to 58%, which sits between the other two forecasters and reflects a synthesis of my initial reasoning with their crucial new insights.",
