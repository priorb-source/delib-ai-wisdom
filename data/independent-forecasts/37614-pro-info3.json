  "information": "Historical data for U.S. local recall elections shows that approximately 60% of recalls that make it to the ballot succeed in removing the official. Several recent recall efforts in other small Colorado towns have been successful. In March 2025, three council members in Dillon were removed by voters in a recall election related to a development plan. In a separate 2025 case in Loveland, the targeted council member resigned from his position after a recall petition gathered sufficient signatures.",

    "status_quo_outcome": "Brent Metz is currently a town councilor for Mountain View, Colorado.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A majority of voters in the May 20, 2025, election vote in favor of the recall, and Brent Metz is removed from his position as town councilor.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A majority of voters in the May 20, 2025, election vote against the recall, and Brent Metz retains his seat as town councilor.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the extreme severity of the accusation against Councilor Metz and the historical success rate of local recall elections. The research assistant's report indicates a base rate of approximately 60% success for recalls that make it to the ballot, meaning an official is removed. This sets a baseline probability of only 40% for Metz retaining his seat. However, the reason for this recall—an accusation of shooting a teenager in the face—is far more serious and emotionally charged than typical policy disputes that often trigger recalls. This specific charge is likely to mobilize a significant portion of the electorate against him, pushing the probability of his survival well below the 40% baseline. The recent successful recalls in other small Colorado towns, like Dillon, suggest a current political climate in the state that is favorable to such efforts. \n\nMy forecast is not lower (e.g., below 15%) because there is always a degree of uncertainty in low-turnout special elections. Metz retains a platform to defend himself, and in a small town, personal relationships and a dedicated base of support could prove resilient. Details of the incident may be more complex than headlines suggest, potentially swaying some voters.\n\nMy forecast is not higher (e.g., above 30%) because the gravity of the accusation is a uniquely powerful motivator for voters that likely overwhelms the normal inertia favoring the status quo. It is difficult for an elected official to politically survive such a damaging event, regardless of the eventual legal outcome.\n\nI would increase my probability forecast for 'Yes' if credible evidence emerged that strongly exonerates Metz or if prominent community leaders publicly rally to his defense. I would decrease the probability if polling data (if available) showed overwhelming support for the recall or if Metz were to face new, credible accusations.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
