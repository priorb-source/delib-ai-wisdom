  "information": "In Africa, a coup attempt in Burkina Faso was reportedly foiled on April 16, 2025, leading to the arrest of several army officers. This follows a January 2025 attack on the presidential palace in Chad, which was also viewed as a potential coup attempt. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has expressed concern over a wave of unconstitutional changes in West Africa, noting that between August 2020 and August 2024, the region experienced nine coup attempts, four of which were successful. Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso have withdrawn from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to form their own 'Sahel Alliance.' According to a report by Amnesty International, since the July 2023 coup in Niger, there has been a sharp escalation of human rights violations, including arbitrary detentions and violations of press freedom.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 67 days (from April 25, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - there has not yet been a successful coup in Africa or Latin America during the question period, so if nothing changes the outcome would be No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The remaining two months pass without any military or state elites successfully overthrowing a government in Africa or Latin America. Regional organizations and national security forces continue to foil coup attempts, as happened in Burkina Faso in April 2025. Any political instability is managed through existing institutional channels rather than military takeovers.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Military forces or other state elites in a fragile African nation, particularly in the Sahel region (Chad, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger) or another vulnerable country, successfully execute a coup d'état in the next 2 months. Given recent instability and the foiled April 2025 Burkina Faso attempt, another attempt could succeed in establishing control over government and military apparatus.",
    "rationale": "The base rate for successful coups in Africa and Latin America has been approximately 2-3 per year based on recent history (2020-2024), with the Nigerian President noting 4 successful coups out of 9 attempts (44% success rate) between August 2020 and August 2024. With only 67 days remaining, the expected number of coups based on historical rates would be roughly 0.4-0.5 events (2.5 coups/year × 0.184 years). The research assistant's report indicates ongoing instability: a foiled coup attempt in Burkina Faso just occurred in April 2025, and a January 2025 attack on Chad's presidential palace suggests continued vulnerability. The Sahel region remains particularly unstable with Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso forming a breakaway alliance. However, several factors moderate the probability: the recent Burkina Faso attempt was successfully foiled, showing defensive capacity exists; only 2 months remain, which is a relatively short window; and most coups require significant planning and opportune political moments. The question requires a SUCCESSFUL coup, not just an attempt, which further reduces probability. I estimate around 40% because the short timeframe combined with active instability and recent coup patterns suggests meaningful risk, but the status quo bias and defensive measures prevent a higher forecast. I would update higher with evidence of major political crises or military unrest in vulnerable countries, and lower if the next few weeks pass without significant coup signals or if stabilization efforts prove effective.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to [Powell & Thyne (2011, p. 252)](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf), a coup is \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\" In recent years, some of the coups in Africa have been:&#x20;\n\n* [Mali August 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Mali May 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Niger March 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Nigerien_coup_attempt) (attempt)\n* [Niger July 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nigerien_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Gabon August 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Gabonese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Chad January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%27Djamena_attack) (possible attempt)\n* [Burkina Faso January 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Burkina Faso September 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)&#x20;\n* [Guinea September 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n\nLatin America has had the following coup attempts in recent years:\n\n* [Peru self-coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Peruvian_self-coup_attempt), December 2022\n* [Brazil Congress attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack), January 2023\n* [Bolivia coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bolivian_coup_attempt), June 2024\n\nSee also: [VoA by the numbers Coups in Africa](https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is a successful coup d’état in any country on the African continent or Latin America before July 1, 2025, according to credible media reports. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nLatin America is defined as any country in North America or South America whose primary language is Spanish, Portuguese or French.\n\nA coup d’état (often shortened to \"coup\") is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) as an event in which a state's military or other components of its power structure overthrow the existing political authority.&#x20;\n\nA \"successful\" coup is defined as a coup in which the group or person attempting to seize power establishes control over both the government and military, and will be considered to have succeeded once any significant resistance to their authority has ceased.&#x20;\n\nA self-coup, [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup) as a political leader, having come to power through legal means, remaining in power through illegal means, will count. This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Africa, a coup attempt in Burkina Faso was reportedly foiled on April 16, 2025, leading to the arrest of several army officers.
