    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, have reached a similar conclusion: the probability of Ukraine announcing a presidential election date before July 1, 2025, is very low. We all agree that the primary barriers are the ongoing state of martial law, which constitutionally prohibits elections, the immense practical difficulties of holding a vote during a full-scale invasion, and a strong domestic political consensus to prioritize defense over electoral politics. The key difference lies in the specific probabilities we assigned, ranging from my initial 2% to 7%. The other two forecasters raised arguments that I had not fully articulated: the possibility of a 'symbolic announcement' made for diplomatic reasons (e.g., as part of a peace negotiation or to secure aid) and the potential for a 'legal workaround' or new interpretation from the Constitutional Court that distinguishes the 'announcement' of an election from the 'holding' of one. I find these arguments for a 'Yes' outcome to be more specific and plausible than the generic 'black swan' events I had initially considered, which justifies a higher probability than 2%.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 2% to 4%. My core reasoning remains unchanged: the legal, military, and political status quo strongly disfavors any election announcement in the extremely short timeframe of the next 45 days. Martial law is in effect and the Ukrainian government has been consistent in its messaging that elections will only be considered after the war. However, the other forecasters' analyses have convinced me that I was slightly underweighting specific, albeit still highly unlikely, political scenarios. My initial 2% was anchored in the possibility of a major, unforeseen event like a sudden cessation of hostilities. Their arguments highlight the more nuanced possibility that a specific diplomatic pressure point or a nascent peace negotiation could compel a 'symbolic' announcement of a future election date, even while martial law is still active. This would satisfy the resolution criteria. While I still view this as extremely improbable given the potential for domestic political destabilization, it is a more concrete path to a 'Yes' outcome than I had previously considered. I am raising my forecast to 4% to better reflect this small but non-zero possibility. I remain lower than the other forecasters (5% and 7%) because I believe the immense domestic political risks and the unified focus on the war effort make such a symbolic political maneuver a very remote prospect in the immediate future.",
