    "review": "The deliberation revealed a critical new piece of information and a valuable counterargument. Forecaster 3 introduced intelligence about discussions for a 'birthday summit' near June 14-15, providing a specific, plausible mechanism for a 'Yes' outcome that my initial analysis lacked. This is a very strong argument for increasing the forecast. Conversely, Forecaster 2's analysis persuasively emphasized the high degree of public friction, citing China's recent denial of talks, and argued this makes the resolution criteria of 'mutual acknowledgement' an extremely high bar. This serves as a powerful check against over-optimism based on the summit rumor.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 20% to 30%. The primary reason for this increase is the new information from Forecaster 3 regarding a potential 'birthday summit.' This provides a specific, timeline-appropriate reason for a leader-level call that is more concrete than my original thesis, which relied on a generic breakthrough at the Geneva talks. Such a summit would almost certainly require a preparatory phone call between the leaders that would likely be acknowledged. However, I am tempering my update based on Forecaster 2's cogent points about the difficult diplomatic climate. The recent public denials from China highlight the friction and make the 'mutual acknowledgement' clause in the resolution criteria a significant hurdle. My updated forecast of 30% reflects a balance between these competing factors: it incorporates the substantial new possibility of a summit-related call while still heavily weighting the observable political tensions that make such a call, and especially its mutual acknowledgement, less likely than not.",
