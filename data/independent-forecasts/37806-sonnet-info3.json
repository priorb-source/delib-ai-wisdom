  "information": "The Diversity Visa program, which grants up to 55,000 visas annually, has continued to operate. The results for the 2025 lottery were scheduled for release on May 3, 2025, with the application period for the 2027 lottery set to open in October 2025. Of the more than 40 presidential actions issued since January 2025, none have contained the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa.' The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website has not posted any official notice of the program's cancellation. Legal analyses mentioned in reports suggest that since the program is established by statute, substantial changes would typically require new legislation passed by Congress.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "42 days (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no presidential action mentioning 'Diversity Visa' has been issued",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues focusing on other immigration priorities such as border security and deportations without issuing a specific presidential action that mentions 'Diversity Visa' by name. His administration may pursue legislative changes through Congress instead, or use other terminology in executive actions that don't include the exact required phrase.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump issues an executive order, proclamation, or memorandum within the next 42 days that specifically uses the phrase 'Diversity Visa' - perhaps suspending the program, directing agencies to implement restrictions, or announcing changes to its administration. This could be prompted by the recent May 3rd lottery results or as part of a broader immigration reform package.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Despite issuing over 40 presidential actions since January 2025 and maintaining an active immigration agenda, Trump has not mentioned 'Diversity Visa' in any presidential action over nearly 5 months in office. The research assistant confirms the program continues operating normally with lottery results released on schedule. Several factors support maintaining this status quo: (1) The program is established by statute, limiting what presidential actions can accomplish without Congressional legislation; (2) The strict requirement for the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' rather than synonyms like 'visa lottery' makes it less likely; (3) Only 42 days remain, a relatively short window; (4) The May 3rd lottery results already occurred without triggering action. However, the probability isn't negligible because: (1) Background articles show Trump and conservative allies have advocated canceling this program; (2) His administration remains highly focused on immigration issues; (3) He could still issue a symbolic or directive-based action even if substantive changes require Congress; (4) 42 days is still enough time for a single presidential action. I'm not going higher because the 5-month track record of inaction is strong evidence, and I'm not going lower because Trump's opposition to the program is documented and he remains active on immigration. New statements from administration officials about the Diversity Visa or leaked executive action drafts would push me higher; continued silence or focus on other priorities would push me lower.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill President Trump issue a new presidential action mentioning the Diversity Visa before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | The American Conservative: [Trump Should Cancel the Diversity Visa Program](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-should-cancel-the-diversity-visa-program/) | Mint: [US Green Card Diversity Visa 2026 Lottery results released: What you need to know](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/us-green-card-diversity-visa-2026-lottery-results-released-what-you-need-to-know-11746381683106.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, President Donald J. Trump issues a [presidential action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/) mentioning the \"Diversity Visa\" (using exactly those words). If this does not occur before that date, this resolves as **No**.\n\nTo count, the presidential action must be published and publicly accessible (appearing on the presidential actions section of the White House website) before the specified time. A verbal statement or other written announcement besides a presidential action (for example a post on social media), is not sufficient.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Diversity Visa program, which grants up to 55,000 visas annually, has continued to operate.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
