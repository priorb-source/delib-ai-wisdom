    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides the most critical new information: March 2025 data showing inventory at 503,000, representing only 3,000 unit growth from February (0.6% monthly). This is far more concrete than my initial analysis. Their calculation that we need 4.7% monthly growth (8x the current pace) over just two remaining months is mathematically sound and sobering. Forecaster 3 raises an important counterpoint about the 6-12 month construction pipeline lag, which could cause inventory to accumulate even as starts decline. However, the March data significantly weakens this argument - if the pipeline were delivering substantial completions, we should have seen more than 3,000 units added in March. The declining starts data Forecaster 3 cites (down 14.2%) combined with the March inventory numbers suggests the pipeline may already be thinning. Forecaster 2's 8% feels too pessimistic given seasonal factors and potential volatility in short windows, while Forecaster 3's 40% doesn't sufficiently account for the weak March growth rate.",
    "rationale": "The March 2025 data at 503,000 units is decisive new information. Starting from this concrete baseline, reaching 550,000+ requires 47,000+ units in just April and May - an average of 23,500 per month or 4.7% monthly growth. The February-to-March growth of only 0.6% provides clear evidence that current momentum is far below what's needed. This represents an 8x acceleration requirement. While I initially weighted the multi-year upward trend and construction pipeline heavily, the March data shows these factors aren't currently translating into rapid inventory growth. The spring buying season could paradoxically work against inventory buildup if demand absorbs completions. The declining starts and weak builder confidence cited by Forecaster 3 further dampen the pipeline argument. However, two months remains a short enough window that unexpected acceleration is possible, preventing me from going as low as Forecaster 2's 8%. My original 38% overweighted long-term trends and underweighted the difficulty of such rapid acceleration in a short timeframe. I'm revising down to 28%.",
