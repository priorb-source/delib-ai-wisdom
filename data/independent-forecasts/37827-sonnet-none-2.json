    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks until June 2025 ends, with the outcome determinable shortly after July 1, 2025 when NUFORC is checked",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the default assumption is that this specific combination of events (pilot report + African country + June 2025 + NUFORC posting) will not occur",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No pilots in African countries observe and report UFOs to NUFORC during June 2025, or any such sightings are reported through other channels, or NUFORC doesn't post the reports in their database",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial, military, or private pilot flying somewhere in Africa during June 2025 observes an unexplained aerial phenomenon and submits a report to NUFORC, which then posts it to their database accessible at the specified link",
    "rationale": "The key evidence here is the January 2025 Rwanda pilot report, which establishes that such reports from Africa do occur on NUFORC. However, several factors constrain the probability: (1) NUFORC is primarily a US-based reporting platform, so international reports may be less frequent; (2) Pilot reports are a subset of all UFO reports - most reports come from the general public; (3) Africa represents a specific geographic constraint with less aviation traffic than North America or Europe; (4) We're looking at a single specific month (1/12 of the year). Without historical data on the frequency of African pilot reports on NUFORC, I must estimate conservatively. The January 2025 example suggests perhaps 2-6 such reports per year from Africa, which would give any single month roughly 15-40% probability if evenly distributed. However, reporting patterns may not be uniform. The forecast is not higher because: the combination of constraints is quite specific, and we lack evidence that such reports are common. The forecast is not lower because: we have recent concrete evidence it can happen, African aviation is substantial, and only one report is needed. I would update higher if I learned that African pilot reports on NUFORC were more frequent than estimated, or if there were patterns suggesting June is an active month. I would update lower if historical data showed African pilot reports were rare (less than 1-2 per year)",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
