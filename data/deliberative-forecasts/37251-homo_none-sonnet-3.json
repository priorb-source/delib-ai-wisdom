    "review": "The other forecasters raise several valid points I should incorporate. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes South Korea's proven K9 export infrastructure - Korea has successfully exported these howitzers to multiple countries, which means established frameworks, templates, and processes exist that could accelerate negotiations even for a first-time partner. This partially mitigates my concern about the 'first-time' complexity. Forecaster 3 effectively frames the negotiations as 'already underway' rather than starting from scratch, which is a more positive framing of the same facts. Both forecasters also properly weight the strong bilateral incentives. However, I notice all three of us cluster around 28-35%, suggesting general agreement on the key dynamics. The main difference is how much weight to give Korea's export capabilities versus the tight 2-month timeline and lack of evidence about negotiation progress.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I should modestly increase my forecast to acknowledge South Korea's established K9 export infrastructure and experience, which I underweighted initially. Korea's proven track record with K9 exports means many procedural elements (contracts, technical specifications, training protocols) can be adapted from existing templates rather than created from scratch. This reduces - though doesn't eliminate - the 'first-time partner' complexity barrier. The active negotiations with defined parameters (20 units, $300M) also signal more concrete progress than vague exploratory talks. However, I remain cautious about moving too high because: (1) We still only have 2 months, which is objectively very short for finalizing a $300M defense agreement; (2) The complete absence of any updates or news suggests either highly confidential late-stage negotiations OR stalled/slow progress - we cannot distinguish which; (3) 'Reportedly in negotiations' indicates this hasn't been officially confirmed by either government; (4) Regional sensitivities with China could create additional diplomatic complexity. The balance of evidence suggests moving from 28% to approximately 30% - acknowledging Korea's export capabilities while maintaining appropriate caution about the compressed timeline and lack of visible momentum.",
