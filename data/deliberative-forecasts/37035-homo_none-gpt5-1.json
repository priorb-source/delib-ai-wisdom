    "review": "Both forecasters align with my baseline: CDC very rarely issues Level 3 countrywide Travel Health Notices for vector-borne diseases when effective mitigation (notably vaccination) exists. The explicit historical reference to Brazil’s large 2016–2018 yellow fever waves remaining at Level 2 is a useful anchor supporting a low base rate. Forecaster 3’s clarification of the resolution rule (effectively “greater than 2” means Level 3 in practice) is correct and removes ambiguity from the phrasing. Neither forecaster surfaced concrete new signals (e.g., WHO/PAHO escalation, urban transmission, traveler cases, vaccine shortages) that would justify raising odds. Their update triggers match mine. Overall, their reasoning reinforces a slightly lower probability on base-rate/inertia grounds over a short window.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~5.5 weeks until June 1, 2025.\n- Status quo: CDC currently lists Colombia at Level 2; inertia plus CDC’s high bar for Level 3 favors no change in the timeframe.\n- Base rate: For yellow fever in the Americas, even sizable outbreaks (e.g., Brazil 2016–2018) did not typically lead to Level 3. CDC tends to emphasize vaccination and targeted precautions rather than broad “avoid nonessential travel” guidance.\n- Triggers needed for a Yes: Clear evidence of widespread/urban transmission in major population centers or tourist hubs, significant vaccine access constraints impacting travelers, multiple traveler cases, or PAHO/WHO/CDC HAN alerts indicating rapidly escalating risk despite precautions. None are presently in evidence.\n- Short horizon: Even if conditions deteriorate, CDC escalation to Level 3 within weeks is possible but uncommon.\nGiven the additional calibration from peers (particularly the Brazil precedent), I slightly lower my estimate from 10% to 9%.",
