  "information": "The U.S. Department of Education is establishing a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee, named the Student Loans and Affordability Committee, tasked with developing proposed regulations for federal student aid programs. A key focus of this committee will be to refine the definition of qualifying employers for Public Service Loan Forgiveness eligibility. The deadline for nominations for negotiators was June 1, 2025, and the committee is scheduled to hold its first session from June 30 to July 2, 2025, with proposed and final rules anticipated for release later in 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. government continues its planned regulatory process to refine the PSLF program, or takes no significant action to terminate it. As a result, the spreadsheet's status remains 'in progress' or is updated to another status other than 'complete' by the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. government takes a swift and decisive action, such as an executive order or a fast-tracked legislative bill, to terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. This action is successfully completed, and the Project 2025 Tracker moderators update the spreadsheet to mark the objective as 'complete' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly driven by the typically slow pace of governmental processes and specific, contradictory evidence. The status quo is that the objective is 'in progress,' and terminating a major federal program requires significant political and legislative effort, making a change in the next 1.5 months highly improbable. The key evidence from my research assistant is that the Department of Education is not moving to terminate the program, but to refine it via a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee. Critically, this committee's first session is scheduled for June 30 to July 2, 2025, which straddles the resolution deadline. This action is the opposite of termination and signals a long-term plan for the program's modification, not its imminent end. My probability is not higher than 1% because the government's current, publicly scheduled actions are fundamentally incompatible with the 'Yes' scenario. My forecast is not 0% because I must account for the small, residual possibility of a sudden, unforeseen 'black swan' event like a drastic executive order. I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports that the rulemaking committee was cancelled and an executive order for termination was being drafted. I would become even more confident in a 'No' outcome if administration officials publicly reaffirm their commitment to the rulemaking process as the sole path forward for PSLF.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. Department of Education is establishing a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee, named the Student Loans and Affordability Committee, tasked with developing proposed regulations for federal student aid programs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
