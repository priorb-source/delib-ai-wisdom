  "information": "GameStop's annual shareholder meetings have historically been held in the first half of June. Recent meetings have shown a pattern of being held on a Thursday. Past dates include June 2, 2022 (Thursday), June 15, 2023 (Thursday), and an initial schedule of June 13, 2024 (Thursday). The 2024 virtual meeting was adjourned to a later date after its servers crashed due to overwhelming interest from shareholders attempting to join the webcast.\n\nAs of late May 2025, no definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A) filed by GameStop with the SEC for its 2025 annual meeting has been located. According to SEC rules, such a filing is required ahead of a shareholder meeting. Business information aggregators present conflicting information: Computershare, GameStop's transfer agent, lists the meeting for June 2, 2025, while sources like Business Insider and Bloomberg terminals list June 12, 2025. The Business Insider entry also contains an apparent error regarding a dividend payment.\n\nIt is standard corporate practice for companies to avoid rescheduling an annual meeting within a two-week period unless there is a significant reason. Meetings can sometimes be intentionally adjourned if a controversial proposal requires more time for proxy solicitation. GameStop has previously done this for a share-increase motion. The technical failure that affected GameStop's 2024 meeting is a known risk, though many other large-cap companies regularly hold virtual meetings without major incidents.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days until June 12, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Uncertain - no confirmed date with conflicting sources listing June 2 vs June 12, and no SEC proxy filing located yet",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The meeting is scheduled for a different date than June 12, OR the meeting begins on June 12 but is adjourned due to technical issues similar to 2024, OR GameStop postpones the meeting entirely for proxy solicitation reasons",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "GameStop files a proxy statement confirming June 12, 2025 as the meeting date in the coming days, and the meeting proceeds and fully completes on that date without technical disruptions or adjournments",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces significant uncertainty due to conflicting information and the absence of a definitive SEC filing just 16 days before the proposed date. The research assistant identifies contradictory sources: Computershare lists June 2 while Business Insider and Bloomberg list June 12. Given we're now May 27 and only 6 days from June 2, the absence of a required proxy filing makes that date highly unlikely, lending some credibility to June 12.\n\nIn favor of June 12: It falls on a Thursday, matching GameStop's historical pattern (2022, 2023, 2024 meetings were all scheduled for Thursdays). Multiple business sources cite this date. Mid-June timing aligns with historical practice.\n\nAgainst June 12: No SEC proxy filing has been located yet, which is unusual this close to a major corporate event. The strict resolution criteria require the meeting to fully complete - merely starting doesn't count. GameStop's 2024 meeting crashed due to server overload and was adjourned, creating precedent for technical failure. One source (Business Insider) contains errors, undermining reliability.\n\nThe base rate for companies holding annual meetings as scheduled is high, but GameStop's 2024 technical failure and retail investor interest create elevated risk. Even if June 12 is the scheduled date (perhaps 55% likely given the pattern but lack of confirmation), there's meaningful risk it doesn't complete successfully (perhaps 20-30% failure risk based on 2024 precedent and strict resolution criteria).\n\nI would update higher (to 60-70%) if a DEF 14A proxy filing confirms June 12, or if GameStop issues a public announcement. I would update lower (to 20-30%) if a filing appears showing a different date, or if we reach June 5+ without any filing appearing.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
