  "information": "The ongoing trade war with China is a frequently cited source of uncertainty for American consumers, with the U.S. having doubled steel tariffs. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller has outlined a potential path to interest rate cuts later in the year, but noted that considerable uncertainty remains around the level of tariffs. Waller also largely dismissed the high inflation expectations recorded in the University of Michigan survey, stating a preference for market-based measures and professional forecasts.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recent data from May 2025 was described as a 'plunge,' indicating a strong negative trend. Without a significant positive economic surprise, the index is likely to remain at or below the 60.0 threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Persistently high inflation data for May (released in June), an escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, or a surprisingly weak labor market report would reinforce consumer pessimism and keep the index at or below 60.0.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A combination of positive news, such as a surprisingly low inflation report, signs of de-escalation in the trade war, or a strong jobs report, could boost consumer confidence about the future and push the index above the 60.0 level.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 40% is anchored to the recent negative momentum. The status quo, as described by the 'plunge' in sentiment, is a powerful indicator that consumers are feeling pessimistic. This is supported by the headwinds identified in the research report: the ongoing trade war with China, including doubled steel tariffs, creates uncertainty and threatens higher prices for consumers. Furthermore, while the Federal Reserve is considering rate cuts, Governor Waller's comments suggest they are not imminent and are contingent on resolving 'considerable uncertainty,' providing little short-term relief for consumer worries. Why the forecast is not lower: The 60.0 threshold is a relatively low bar, and consumer sentiment can be volatile. A single piece of significant good news, like a favorable CPI report or a strong jobs number within the forecast window, could be enough to cause a modest rebound above this level. Why the forecast is not higher: Reversing the strong downward momentum suggested by a 'plunge' in just a few weeks would require a substantial positive catalyst. The existing negative factors of trade uncertainty and a cautious Fed are concrete and are likely to continue weighing on sentiment through June. I would increase my forecast with concrete news of tariff reductions or a surprisingly dovish shift in Fed communication. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if upcoming inflation data is higher than expected or trade tensions escalate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be greater than 60.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is greater than 60.0 for June 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe ongoing trade war with China is a frequently cited source of uncertainty for American consumers, with the U.S. having doubled steel tariffs. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller has outlined a potential path to interest rate cuts later in the year, but noted that considerable uncertainty remains around the level of tariffs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
