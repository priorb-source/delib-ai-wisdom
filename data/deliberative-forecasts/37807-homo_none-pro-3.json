    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental driver of this forecast: bureaucratic inertia. We all believe the status quo is heavily favored due to the slow pace of change within federal agencies. Their key contribution was to starkly frame the remaining time as 'six weeks' or 'less than two months'. My initial analysis was based on the timeframe since a potential new administration took office in January, but they rightly focused on the very short window remaining from today until the resolution date. This a crucial point. Their argument that if this were a high-priority, symbolic action, we likely would have seen some movement or public messaging on it in the four months that have already passed is extremely convincing. The fact that there's been silence on this specific issue significantly strengthens the case that it is not a priority and is unlikely to be addressed in the next few weeks. Their higher confidence of 95% is more appropriate given this focused and much shorter timeframe.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 85% was based on the principle that while bureaucratic inertia is strong, a new administration would have roughly 5.5 months (from January 20 to July 1) to enact a symbolic change. I assigned a 15% probability to the risk that a motivated political appointee would force a cosmetic update to the webpage to signal a new policy direction, even without underlying regulatory changes.\n\nAfter reviewing the other forecasts, I am updating my probability. The other forecasters correctly emphasized that the relevant timeframe is not the 5.5 months since January, but the approximately six weeks remaining from today (May 20) until the resolution date. A new administration has already been in place for four months. The absence of any public announcements, directives, or even rumors about restricting SNAP purchases by this point makes it highly improbable that this specific webpage change is a priority. The window for 'quick wins' from a new administration is closing. For this change to happen now, a directive would need to be issued, drafted, reviewed by multiple offices (legal, communications, policy), and implemented—a process exceedingly unlikely to be completed in just over a month for a non-emergency issue. The arguments from the other forecasters have convinced me that I overestimated the likelihood of this specific, low-level action being prioritized and completed in the short remaining time. I now assess the risk of a 'No' outcome as being much lower, closer to 5%.\n",
