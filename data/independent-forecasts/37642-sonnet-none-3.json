    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No rate cut. The Federal Reserve maintains its current interest rate levels through the end of June 2025, continuing the pause in rate cuts that has already been implemented.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Fed continues its pause through June 2025. Economic data shows resilient growth and persistent inflation concerns, leading the FOMC to maintain current rates at their June meeting. The Fed signals patience and data-dependency, preferring to wait for clearer signs of sustained disinflation before resuming cuts.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Economic conditions deteriorate meaningfully in late May or early June 2025, with softer employment data, declining inflation readings, or financial market stress. The FOMC responds at their June meeting (likely mid-June) by announcing a 25 basis point rate cut, citing changed economic conditions that warrant resumption of the easing cycle.",
    "rationale": "The key factors in this forecast are timing and the current policy stance. With 6.5 weeks remaining, there is likely one FOMC meeting scheduled (typically in mid-June). The Fed has recently paused rate cuts, which signals they believe current policy is appropriately positioned and they want to assess incoming data. This pause suggests a deliberate wait-and-see approach rather than urgency to cut further.\n\nThe status quo bias is important here. The Fed rarely makes abrupt policy reversals within such short timeframes without significant economic developments. Since they just paused cuts, reversing course in the next meeting would require either: (1) a substantial negative surprise in economic data, (2) unexpected financial market disruption, or (3) a rapid decline in inflation metrics.\n\nGiven normal economic conditions, none of these developments typically materialize in 6-week windows. The Fed is also cautious and data-dependent, preferring to see sustained trends rather than reacting to single data points.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: the recent pause signals satisfaction with current policy, economic conditions generally change gradually, and the Fed has shown patience in its approach. My forecast is not lower because: there is sufficient time for one more FOMC meeting where conditions could theoretically warrant a cut, and unexpected economic shocks, while unlikely, remain possible.\n\nTo update higher, I would need to see: significant economic weakening, sharp drops in inflation, or clear Fed communication suggesting imminent cuts. To update lower, I would need: the May/June FOMC meeting passing without a cut and hawkish Fed commentary emphasizing the pause will continue.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement. Therefore, the effective date of the rate cut does not need to be before the resolution date, as long as the announcement is made before then.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
