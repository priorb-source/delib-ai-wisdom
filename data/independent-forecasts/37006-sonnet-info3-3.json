  "information": "Seat projection models, including Canada388 and The Writ, estimate the Bloc Québécois will win between 19 and 25 seats. Projections for the Conservative Party place their seat count between 10 and 12. The increase in Liberal support is reported to primarily affect the Bloc's vote share rather than the Conservatives'. The Conservative party's support is most concentrated in the Quebec City region and its south shore.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 months. The 2025 Canadian federal election is expected to occur in fall 2025, likely October, meaning the outcome will be known by late October 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Bloc Québécois wins more seats than Conservative Party. Current projections show Bloc winning 19-25 seats versus Conservatives winning 10-12 seats in Quebec.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A major surge in Conservative support across Quebec beyond their Quebec City base, or a dramatic collapse of Bloc support that allows Conservatives to catch up. This would require Conservatives to roughly double their projected seats while Bloc loses a significant portion, closing a gap of approximately 10-15 seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The status quo holds and current seat projection models remain roughly accurate. The Bloc maintains its traditional strength in Quebec despite Liberal gains under Mark Carney, while Conservative support remains concentrated in the Quebec City region without significant expansion into other areas of the province.",
    "rationale": "Current seat projections strongly favor the Bloc winning more seats, with models estimating 19-25 seats for Bloc versus 10-12 for Conservatives - roughly a 2:1 advantage. The research indicates that while Mark Carney's Liberal surge may erode Bloc support, it primarily affects the Bloc rather than boosting Conservatives. Conservative support is geographically concentrated in Quebec City and its south shore, limiting their ability to dramatically expand their seat count. For a No outcome, Conservatives would need to overcome a substantial deficit of approximately 10 seats, requiring them to roughly double their performance while Bloc collapses - a significant political realignment in just 5-6 months. While the time horizon allows for political dynamics to shift, the Bloc's structural advantages as Quebec's regional sovereignty party and the Conservatives' limited geographic base make maintaining the current order more likely. My forecast is not higher because 5-6 months provides sufficient time for campaign dynamics, leadership effects, and voter sentiment to shift meaningfully, particularly given Carney's reported surge. My forecast is not lower because current projections show a substantial gap that would require dramatic reversal, and the Conservative Party would need to expand well beyond their traditional base in a province where they face structural challenges.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Bloc Québécois win more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Carney’s Surge in Quebec Could Wipe the Sovereigntist Party Off the Map](https://thewalrus.ca/carneys-surge-in-quebec-could-wipe-the-sovereigntist-party-off-the-map/) | [In Quebec City, a Conservative candidate cannot run and the Bloc is benefitting](https://nationalpost.com/news/in-quebec-city-a-conservative-candidate-cannot-run-and-the-bloc-is-benefitting)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Bloc Québécois party wins more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party of Canada in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election). If it wins the same or fewer seats, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeat projection models, including Canada388 and The Writ, estimate the Bloc Québécois will win between 19 and 25 seats. Projections for the Conservative Party place their seat count between 10 and 12. The increase in Liberal support is reported to primarily affect the Bloc's vote share rather than the Conservatives'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
