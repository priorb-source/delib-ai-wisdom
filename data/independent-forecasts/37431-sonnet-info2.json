  "information": "The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) oversees the recall process. For a recall to be formally closed, the FSIS must complete effectiveness checks and verify that the company has removed all affected products from commerce, notified customers, and implemented corrective actions. Historical data for similar recalls show varied timelines; medium-scale allergen recalls (10,000-100,000 lbs) typically take 60 to 120 days to close. Other analyses suggest a mean closure time of 45 days for allergen/misbranding recalls, with about half of comparable recalls in 2023-2024 closing within 70 days.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "57 days remain until July 1, 2025, the resolution date. The recall was issued 11 days ago on April 24, 2025, giving a total window of 68 days from recall issuance to the resolution cutoff date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The recall is currently Active. Without completion of all FSIS effectiveness checks, product removal verification, customer notifications, and corrective actions, the status will remain Active past July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall closure process extends beyond 68 days due to standard procedural timelines. The FSIS effectiveness checks take longer than expected, or the company faces delays in confirming complete product removal from commerce. Given that the typical range for medium-scale allergen recalls is 60-120 days, a 68-day closure would be at the faster end but still within reasonable bounds for the process to remain incomplete.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ACC Central Kitchen LLC acts swiftly to remove all affected products, provides comprehensive documentation to FSIS, and completes all corrective actions efficiently. FSIS prioritizes the effectiveness checks and the recall tracks closer to the 45-day mean cited in the research, allowing closure with about 2-3 weeks to spare before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant provides crucial statistical context: medium-scale allergen recalls (10,000-100,000 lbs) typically take 60-120 days, with a mean of 45 days and approximately 50% closing within 70 days. This 65,000-lb recall falls squarely in the medium range. The 68-day window from recall issuance (April 24) to resolution date (July 1) is significant: it's well above the 45-day mean but just below the 70-day median. This positioning suggests the probability should be close to but slightly below 50%. Weighing against a Yes outcome: the status quo is that recalls remain Active, and many comparable recalls extend into the 90-120 day range. The bureaucratic process of effectiveness checks, documentation verification, and formal closure typically moves slowly. The 60-120 day 'typical' range suggests 68 days would be on the faster end. Weighing for a Yes outcome: the 45-day mean indicates many recalls close much faster. If the mean is 45 days with a median of 70, this suggests a right-skewed distribution where a substantial minority close very quickly. We're now 11 days in with 57 days remaining - plenty of time if the company is responsive. I would update higher if: evidence emerged that ACC Central Kitchen was particularly proactive, if FSIS showed signs of expedited processing, or if similar recent recalls were closing faster than historical averages. I would update lower if: any complications in the recall process were reported, if the company showed delays in response, or if we passed the 45-day mark (June 8) without closure. My forecast of 47% reflects that we're positioned just below the median closure time, with the status quo bias toward recalls remaining Active tempering what might otherwise be a coin-flip probability.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
