  "information": "Kalshi, a prediction market platform regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has been actively offering daily MLB markets since April 17, 2025. Sports-related contracts represent a significant portion of its business, accounting for over 80% of weekend trading volume. The company has handled substantial trading activity, including $27 million for the Super Bowl and $500 million for the March Madness basketball tournament. Kalshi has also filed with the CFTC to expand its offerings to include single-game predictions.\n\nThe platform faces legal and regulatory challenges. A judge in Nevada is expected to rule quickly on a case involving Kalshi's prediction markets. Major sports leagues have voiced concerns; the NBA has cited 'substantial integrity risks' due to a perceived lack of regulatory oversight compared to traditional sportsbooks, and Major League Baseball has highlighted the need for consumer protections equivalent to state-level regulations. In response, Kalshi has announced plans to enhance user protections, including voluntary opt-outs, self-imposed trading breaks, and deposit caps.\n\nJune is part of the MLB regular season, during which games are scheduled on nearly every calendar day. The MLB All-Star Game is scheduled for July 2025. Other baseball-related events in late June include the Liga Mexicana de Béisbol (LMB) All-Star Game, set to take place from June 27 to 29, 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (through June 30, 2025; outcome clear by July 1)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A court or regulator forces Kalshi to pause or stop single-game MLB markets during June, or Kalshi voluntarily suspends daily MLB offerings (even for one day) due to legal pressure, payments/operational issues, or policy changes. Alternatively, they simply fail to list a market on a given day despite MLB games being scheduled.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi continues its current pattern of posting at least one real-money market tied to a specific MLB game every calendar day in June, with no regulatory interruptions or operational lapses.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: The research indicates Kalshi has been offering daily MLB markets since April 17, 2025, and sports now represent a large share of activity (e.g., 80%+ of weekend volume). June is squarely in the MLB regular season, with games essentially every day. If nothing changes, the most likely outcome is that Kalshi keeps listing at least one MLB game market each day in June. I overweight this status quo because platforms rarely change successful product cadence abruptly, especially over a short, one‑month horizon.\n- Incentives: Sports drive substantial engagement and revenue (e.g., large volumes for Super Bowl and March Madness). That gives Kalshi strong motivation to maintain continuity through June.\n- Risks that keep the probability below ~90–95%:\n  • Legal/regulatory: A Nevada judge is moving quickly on a case involving Kalshi’s prediction markets; leagues (NBA/MLB) have voiced integrity and consumer-protection concerns. While any Nevada-specific restriction likely wouldn’t halt nationwide offering, an injunction or CFTC action that impacts single-game MLB markets could force a pause. Kalshi’s filing to expand single-game offerings signals ongoing regulatory engagement; the timing and scope of approvals remain a source of uncertainty.\n  • Operational brittleness: The criterion requires every day in June. A single missed listing or unplanned operational issue could flip the outcome to No. Even if unlikely, the all-days condition introduces tail risk.\n- Why not higher: Non-trivial regulatory uncertainty in June plus the brittle “every day” requirement.\n- Why not lower: Strong status quo momentum, clear product–market fit for sports, and short forecast horizon reduce the chance of a disruptive change this month.\n- What would move me up: Evidence that the court ruling is narrow/benign or that CFTC has explicitly greenlit their current single-game MLB markets; consistent early-June daily listings; proactive comms from Kalshi committing to uninterrupted MLB markets in June.\n- What would move me down: Any adverse court order or CFTC action affecting sports/single-game markets; a Kalshi announcement pausing or modifying MLB offerings; signs of a payments/ops disruption; or missing a listing on any day early in June.\n- Research assistant inputs used: Active daily MLB markets since Apr 17; sports dominance in trading volume; major event volumes (Super Bowl, March Madness); filing to expand single-game predictions; leagues’ stated concerns; Kalshi’s announced user-protection measures; MLB’s June schedule having games essentially every day.",
