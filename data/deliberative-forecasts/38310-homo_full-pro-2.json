    "review": "The deliberation with my colleagues was highly valuable. We all identified the same core evidence: President Zelenskyy's unambiguous public commitment to attend, Canada's active security preparations, his history of wartime international travel, and the immense strategic importance of the G7 summit for Ukraine. There was no disagreement on the fundamental drivers of the forecast.\n\nThe only notable difference was in the final probability, with my initial 92% being slightly more conservative than their consensus of 95%. Their reasoning, particularly the emphasis on the high diplomatic cost of a head of state rescinding such a clear public commitment, was persuasive. They effectively argued that only a crisis of the highest order—a true tail-risk event—would justify a cancellation, and that my initial forecast might have slightly over-weighted the probability of such an event occurring in the next two weeks. I found this line of reasoning convincing and sufficient to warrant a small adjustment to my forecast.",
    "rationale": "My initial analysis correctly identified that all public-facing evidence points toward President Zelenskyy's attendance. The deliberation with other forecasters reinforced this conclusion and helped me refine the weight I assigned to the primary risk factors. I am updating my forecast from 92% to 95%.\n\nThe key factors supporting this high probability remain unchanged: 1) Zelenskyy's direct and public confirmation on May 27 ('I will be'). As my colleagues noted, reversing such a statement carries significant diplomatic weight and would only be done in a dire emergency. 2) The host nation, Canada, is proceeding with specific and costly security preparations, indicating their high confidence in his arrival. 3) His past and current travel patterns demonstrate both his willingness and ability to undertake such trips for critical diplomatic engagements.\n\nI am raising my forecast because the deliberation convinced me that I was placing slightly too much weight on the general uncertainty of a wartime situation. While the risk of a sudden military escalation or security threat is real, it would need to be an event of major significance to override the powerful incentives and public commitments already in place. A 5% probability for such a low-probability, high-impact event occurring in the next ~12 days feels more accurate than the 8% I had implicitly assigned previously. Therefore, my confidence in a 'Yes' outcome has increased.",
