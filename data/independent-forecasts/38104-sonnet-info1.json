  "information": "The escape from the Orleans Justice Center on May 16, 2025, involved ten inmates and went undetected for seven hours. The inmates created a hole in a wall behind a toilet, climbed out through a maintenance area, and used a mattress to get over a barbed-wire fence. An investigation revealed significant security flaws, including chronic understaffing, with the prison at only 60% of required staffing at the time. A federal monitor's report had previously warned of a deteriorated security situation, citing inmates' ability to manipulate cell locks. At least three jail employees have been arrested in connection with the escape, which the Orleans Parish Sheriff believes was an 'inside job' aided by staff.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days remaining until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - at least one inmate remains at large on July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One or more escapees successfully evade capture through July 1, potentially aided by the assistance network that facilitated the inside job, by fleeing far from Louisiana, or by going into hiding with accomplices. The longer they remain free, the colder the trail becomes, making recapture increasingly difficult.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Law enforcement's intensive multi-agency manhunt successfully locates and captures or kills all remaining escapees within the next 32 days. This could occur through public tips, surveillance technology, mistakes by the fugitives, or systematic searches of likely hideout locations.",
    "rationale": "This question has a very high bar: ALL 10 inmates must be recaptured or killed. According to the May 19 article, 3 had been recaptured quickly but 7 remained at large just 3 days post-escape. We're now 14 days post-escape with 32 days until resolution. The rapid initial recaptures suggest some inmates lacked sophistication, but the 7 who remained free demonstrated better evasion capability. Critical factors weighing against full recapture: (1) The 'inside job' nature indicates planning and potential ongoing support networks; (2) Significant security flaws and staff involvement suggest sophisticated planning; (3) Each day that passes without capture makes trails colder and escapees harder to find; (4) Only ONE inmate needs to remain free for a No outcome. Factors supporting recapture: Modern surveillance capabilities, intensive multi-agency manhunts, public attention generating tips, and limited resources for most fugitives. Historical prison escape data shows while most escapees are eventually caught, comprehensive recapture within 46 days total (32 remaining) when multiple escapees demonstrated initial evasion success is challenging. The status quo strongly favors at least one remaining at large. My forecast is not higher because needing to catch literally everyone is extremely demanding, and the inside job suggests capability. It's not lower because intensive law enforcement efforts do have a meaningful chance of success, especially with modern technology, and significant time remains.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in the [2025 New Orleans jailbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Orleans_jailbreak) have been either recaptured or killed, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions). If any are still at large on July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe escape from the Orleans Justice Center on May 16, 2025, involved ten inmates and went undetected for seven hours.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
