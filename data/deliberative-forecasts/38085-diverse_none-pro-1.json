    "review": "My initial forecast of 60% was heavily anchored on the status quo from one month prior, where 14.0 million residents were in drought, combined with the general principle of drought inertia. Forecaster 2's analysis (55%) largely mirrored my own, reinforcing this perspective. However, Forecaster 3's analysis (22%) provided a compelling, evidence-based counterargument that I had not sufficiently weighed. Their key points were: (1) The powerful and often rapid climatological shift to Florida's wet season between late May and late June, which typically erodes spring droughts. (2) The crucial population math: with ~23 million residents, the 14.0 million threshold requires ~60% of the population to be in drought. Critically, the ~6+ million residents in the Miami-Dade/Broward/Palm Beach metro area mean that even localized, normal-season rainfall in just that region could single-handedly push the total below the threshold. (3) The use of historical analogs, showing that significant spring droughts have often been materially reduced by late June. I find these Florida-specific arguments, particularly the population distribution vulnerability, more persuasive than the general principle of drought inertia I initially relied upon.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward based on the deliberation. My initial analysis over-weighted the status quo and the general slowness of drought recovery. Forecaster 3's arguments convinced me that Florida's climatology in June presents a special case where recovery can be rapid and that the geographic distribution of its population creates a strong vulnerability for the 'Yes' outcome. The fact that normal seasonal rains in the densely populated southeastern coast could resolve the question as 'No' is a powerful factor I had overlooked. While the starting point is exactly at the 14.0 million threshold, the strong seasonal pressure toward improvement makes it more likely than not that the number will drop below this level by June 28th. Therefore, I am shifting my forecast from favoring 'Yes' to favoring 'No'. I am not going as low as Forecaster 3's 22% because the existing drought is significant and a delayed or weak start to the rainy season remains a distinct possibility, which would keep the number elevated. My new forecast reflects a belief that a 'No' outcome is the most likely scenario, but with substantial remaining uncertainty.",
