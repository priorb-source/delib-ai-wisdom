    "review": "The other forecasters introduced critical new information that I had overlooked. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly impactful, highlighting several structural barriers that make a 'Yes' outcome highly improbable. The most decisive new facts were that Han has already missed the April 15 deadline for the People Power Party (PPP) primary registration and that the party leadership has explicitly stated he will not be included. This fundamentally alters the landscape, as it closes the most viable path to candidacy. Forecaster 3 also noted the legal requirement for Han to resign by May 4 to be eligible, a tight deadline that creates another significant hurdle. Forecaster 2's contribution of polling data, showing Han's low support (2-12%) and high unacceptability (66%), strongly reinforces the case against a run by undermining the political rationale for his candidacy. My initial forecast was too high because it was based on the premise that a party draft was a real possibility, a premise that this new evidence effectively refutes.",
    "rationale": "I am substantially decreasing my forecast from 15% to 4%. My initial reasoning over-weighted the narrative of party pressure mentioned in the Chosun Daily article and failed to account for hard procedural and legal constraints. The new information provided during this deliberation, specifically from Forecaster 3, is decisive. The fact that Han has missed the PPP primary deadline and that the party leadership has publicly ruled out his inclusion makes a candidacy under the party's banner almost impossible. This single point invalidates the primary scenario for a 'Yes' resolution. Furthermore, the combination of his very low polling numbers, the constitutional norms against a caretaker leader running, and the requirement to resign from his current post by May 4 create a formidable set of obstacles. The complete absence of campaign infrastructure with less than two weeks to the deadline reinforces this conclusion. The remaining 4% probability accounts for highly unlikely, tail-risk scenarios, such as an unprecedented emergency declaration by the PPP to override its own rules or a surprise independent run, but the overwhelming weight of evidence now points strongly toward 'No'.",
