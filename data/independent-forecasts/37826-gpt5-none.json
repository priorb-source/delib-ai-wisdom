    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 2021 ceasefire framework broadly holds. Any violence remains confined to the Line of Control or Pakistan-administered Kashmir (areas not listed in the resolution criteria). There is no major mass-casualty attack in India attributed to Pakistan-based groups in June, and India refrains from cross-border kinetic action into Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A high-profile attack in India in late May or June is credibly attributed by New Delhi to Pakistan-based militants, prompting a limited punitive strike. The Indian Air Force or missiles conduct a strike on a target in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Balakot-style), or Indian artillery/stand-off munitions hit targets across the international border in Pakistan’s Punjab, or India publicly acknowledges a commando/drone strike on a militant facility inside one of the four provinces.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Cross-border kinetic strikes by India into Pakistan proper are rare. In the past decade, the notable precedent is the 2019 Balakot airstrike in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa following the Pulwama attack; 2016 “surgical strikes” were in Pakistan-administered Kashmir (not among the listed provinces). Routine ceasefire violations are mostly along the LoC and typically confined to Kashmir sectors, which would not satisfy this question’s geographic criteria. There has been a general de-escalation since the 2021 ceasefire understanding.\nTime window: The window is only June 2025, which further lowers odds. Even if tensions exist, aligning a triggering event, decision, preparation, and execution all within a single month is unlikely absent strong, visible precursors.\nDrivers toward Yes: A mass-casualty attack in India with a clear link to Pakistan-based groups; strong domestic pressure for retaliation; visible military preparations (IAF forward deployments, NOTAMs, airspace restrictions, unusual troop movements), and escalatory official rhetoric. The precedent of Balakot shows India is willing to strike in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa under certain conditions.\nDrivers toward No: Nuclear deterrence and escalation risks; international diplomatic pressure; India’s preference for limited, deniable, or non-kinetic responses; and the enduring 2021 ceasefire. Without a major provocation, New Delhi has little incentive to cross the international border into Pakistan’s provinces.\nWhy not higher: There is no known trigger as of May 22, 2025, the window is narrow, and the costs/risks of escalation are substantial. These factors keep the probability well below 10%.\nWhy not lower: Precedent exists (2019), and unforeseen provocations can arise quickly. India maintains capabilities for limited punitive action, including stand-off strikes or drones, that could be executed rapidly if a trigger occurs.\nSignals to update upward: Credible reports of a mass-casualty attack in India attributed to Pakistan-based groups; explicit retaliatory rhetoric by top Indian leadership; visible IAF/Army mobilization, NOTAMs, cross-border airspace closures, or evacuation orders for border communities; Pakistani alerts or defensive mobilization.\nSignals to update downward: Continued quiet along the IB/LoC through mid-June; conciliatory diplomatic signaling; absence of militant incidents; reaffirmations of the ceasefire.\nResearch assistant summary: No additional information available, so the forecast leans heavily on base rates, structural incentives, and the narrow time window.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack in Pakistan proper in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 India–Pakistan conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_conflict)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack on targets in one of the following provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nTo count, an attack must be [kinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_military_action), using explosive weaponry or physical violence. Non-kinetic actions such as a cyberattack would not count, even one resulting in deaths.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
