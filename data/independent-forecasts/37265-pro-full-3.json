  "information": "As of May 2, 2025, Tanzania holds a Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution travel advisory from the US State Department, last updated on September 9, 2024. The advisory cites crime, terrorism, and the targeting of LGBTQI+ persons as primary concerns. While the country is at Level 2 overall, specific regions such as Mtwara have a higher, Level 3 warning. In March 2025, the US Embassy issued an alert regarding coastal security.\n\nSeveral other countries in the region or with similar risk profiles have recently been elevated to Level 3. Uganda's advisory was raised due to terrorism risks, political demonstrations, and discriminatory laws. Burundi's Level 3 advisory cites violent crimes like grenade attacks and armed robbery targeting foreigners. The State Department also reissued a Level 3 alert for Bangladesh due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism, and issued a Level 3 warning for Trinidad and Tobago following a surge in violent crime and a declared state of emergency.\n\nThe US State Department's travel advisory system consists of four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). Advisories are regularly reviewed and can be upgraded due to factors like a significant deterioration in security, increased terrorist activity, political instability, or civil unrest. A notable security concern for Tanzania is the insurgency in Mozambique's Niassa Reserve, which borders the country. Terrorist activity linked to Islamic extremism was reported in the area as recently as April 2025, creating potential spillover risks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months, as the resolution date is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The US State Department travel advisory for Tanzania remains at Level 2.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security situation in Tanzania remains stable. The insurgency in neighboring Mozambique is contained, and there are no significant terrorist incidents or spikes in violent crime targeting US citizens in major cities or tourist areas. The State Department continues to view the existing Level 2 advisory with specific regional warnings as adequate.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant security event occurs, such as a major terrorist attack in Dar es Salaam or Zanzibar, a notable spillover of the insurgency from Mozambique into southern Tanzania, or a sharp, widely reported increase in violent crime targeting foreigners. This event prompts the US State Department to re-evaluate the risk to American travelers nationwide and upgrade the advisory to Level 3.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong tendency for bureaucratic classifications like travel advisories to remain unchanged in the short term, a principle known as status quo bias. Tanzania's advisory has been Level 2 since September 2024, and with less than two months until the deadline, a significant catalyst would be required for a change. The current advisory already accounts for existing risks like crime and terrorism by carving out a Level 3 warning for the high-risk Mtwara region, suggesting the State Department prefers a targeted approach rather than a country-wide escalation.\n\nHowever, the probability is not lower because of several notable risk factors. The ongoing insurgency in Mozambique, with reported terrorist activity near the Tanzanian border as recently as April 2025, presents a credible and proximate threat of spillover violence. Furthermore, the US Embassy's coastal security alert in March 2025 indicates heightened, ongoing concern. Precedents in neighboring countries like Uganda, which was elevated to Level 3 for similar terrorism and crime risks, demonstrate the State Department's willingness to make such changes in the region when conditions warrant.\n\nThe forecast is not higher because the bar for a country-wide advisory change is significant. It would likely require an unambiguous, high-profile event that alters the security assessment for the entire country, not just the border regions. Absent such a dramatic event, the inertia of the current Level 2 advisory is likely to hold for the next two months.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon learning of a successful terrorist attack in a major tourist hub or a significant cross-border incursion. I would decrease it as the July 1 deadline approaches without any major security incidents.",
