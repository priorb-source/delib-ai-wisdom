    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, the referendum is not scheduled",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Alberta government continues normal operations without announcing any independence referendum. Premier Danielle Smith and the United Conservative Party government focus on other provincial priorities such as energy policy, healthcare, and federal-provincial relations without taking the extraordinary step of scheduling a referendum on independence.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Alberta government, facing escalating tensions with the federal government or responding to grassroots pressure, announces a specific date for an independence referendum. This could occur through a premier's statement, legislative resolution, or cabinet decision that officially sets a date for Albertans to vote on independence from Canada.",
    "rationale": "This forecast strongly favors the status quo outcome for several reasons. First, the timeframe is extremely short - only 55 days remain. Scheduling an independence referendum is a momentous political decision that typically requires extensive preparation, public consultation, legislative process, and political groundwork that takes months or years, not weeks. Even Quebec's referendums in 1980 and 1995 had lengthy lead times. Second, my research assistant provided no information suggesting any imminent referendum announcement, which is telling given how significant such news would be. Third, while the Politico article references underlying tensions between Alberta and the federal government, acknowledging grievances is very different from taking concrete steps toward a referendum. Fourth, the base rate of such dramatic constitutional actions is extremely low - these are rare, epoch-defining events. The current premier, Danielle Smith, has expressed frustration with federal policies but has not indicated plans to schedule an independence referendum. Why not 0%? Political situations can occasionally change rapidly, and the question only requires an announcement of a date (not the referendum itself or its legality). A sudden political crisis or calculated political move, while unlikely, remains theoretically possible. Why not higher? There's simply no evidence of preparations, no legislative groundwork, no public campaign building toward this, and insufficient time for the normal political processes that would precede such an announcement. For me to update higher, I would need to see concrete indicators like emergency legislative sessions being called, explicit statements from Alberta leadership about scheduling a referendum, or evidence of active coordination on referendum mechanics. For me to update lower (toward 0%), I would need clear denials from Alberta government officials or evidence they're focused entirely on other priorities.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
