    "review": "The other forecasters and I identified the same core conflict: the immense political will for change versus the powerful institutional inertia of a federal agency. Forecaster 2 (85% Yes) places heavy emphasis on this inertia, arguing that the standard, multi-year process for changing such a recommendation makes a change in under two months nearly impossible. Forecaster 3 (25% Yes) argues this is not a standard process, but a top-down political directive. I found Forecaster 3's key argument particularly compelling: a 'No' outcome does not require a new scientific recommendation, only the removal of the current one. This is a much lower administrative hurdle that a determined HHS Secretary could clear quickly. Forecaster 2's high confidence in the status quo seems to underestimate the power of the HHS Secretary to compel a rapid, non-standard action, like taking the webpage offline pending review.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am updating my own. I initially assigned a 60% probability to 'Yes', slightly favoring bureaucratic inertia over the short timeframe. However, I am now more persuaded by Forecaster 3's reasoning. The explicit statement of intent from the HHS Secretary, combined with coordinated moves at the EPA and FDA, signals a high-priority, politically-driven effort. The crucial point, which Forecaster 3 emphasized effectively, is that the resolution criteria can be met simply by removing the webpage. This is an administrative action, not a scientific one, and can be executed quickly via a direct order. The newly convened task force can be seen as political cover for a decision that has already been made, rather than a genuine prerequisite for action. While institutional resistance and the extremely short timeline still provide a substantial chance for the status quo to hold past July 1st, I now believe the probability of a rapid, politically-motivated action to remove the recommendation is higher than the probability that standard procedure and inertia will prevail. Therefore, I have flipped my forecast from favoring 'Yes' to favoring 'No'. I am not as low as Forecaster 3's 25% because there is still a significant chance of implementation delays or a strategic decision to maintain a facade of procedural regularity for a few more weeks. I am moving my forecast from 60% to 40%.",
