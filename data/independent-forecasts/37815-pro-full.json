  "information": "The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) receives approximately 5,000-6,000 total UFO reports annually. The 'Pilot' report subtype constitutes about 1% of these, amounting to 30-60 reports worldwide per year. Non-US pilot reports are less frequent, with about 3-5 recorded annually from outside the United States. Reports from South American countries average around 1-2 per year. Specific examples of recent pilot reports from the continent logged in the NUFORC database include a sighting in Brazil in December 2024 and one from a Chilean Air Force crew in February 2023. The NUFORC system is based in the United States and uses an English-language reporting form.\n\nThe U.S. government's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) officially document and investigate Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP). In 2020, the Department of Defense established a UAP Task Force to track and analyze sightings. According to official data, 757 UAP reports were documented between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. As of the latest report, only 49 of these cases have been officially closed. A report submitted to the U.S. Congress stated that of the 757 observations, no evidence suggested extraterrestrial origin; analysis indicated approximately 70% of the objects were balloons and 16% were drones.\n\nA number of high-profile encounters between military aircraft and UAPs have been reported in North America. In an incident on January 19, 2023, a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet collided with an unidentified object during a training mission over Arizona, cracking the aircraft's canopy. This event was one of 22 UAP sightings reported by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. Arizona, particularly near military training zones, is described as a hotspot for such sightings. Some U.S. officials have suggested these objects may be advanced drones. In a separate event on September 17, 2024, an Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with a dark grey, football-sized cylindrical object over California.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months. The question concerns events in June 2025 and will be resolved on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Based on historical data, pilot reports from South America to the specified reporting center are infrequent, making it unlikely one will occur and be logged in the specific month of June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The month of June 2025 passes without any pilots in South America having a sighting they choose to report to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), or any reports that are submitted are not published. When the source is checked after July 1, 2025, there are no entries for pilot reports from South America for that month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial or private pilot flying over a South American country, such as Brazil or Chile, observes an unusual aerial phenomenon in June 2025. The pilot is aware of NUFORC and submits a detailed report in English, which is then published by NUFORC and is visible when Metaculus checks the database in July 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the low historical frequency of the specified event. The research indicates that The National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) logs only 1-2 pilot reports from South America per year. Distributing this low annual rate across 12 months suggests a baseline probability of roughly 8-16% for such a report occurring in any given month. I am selecting a value in the lower end of this range, at 10%, to reflect the stochastic nature of such rare events.\n\nThe fact that NUFORC is a US-based, English-language platform presents a significant reporting barrier for many pilots in South America. This structural factor suppresses the reporting rate and reinforces the status quo, making a 'No' outcome the most probable scenario.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 10% because these reports, while rare, do occur. The provided examples from Brazil (December 2024) and Chile (February 2023) confirm that the reporting pathway exists and is used occasionally. A probability near zero would incorrectly dismiss this established, albeit infrequent, pattern.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because there is no specific information to suggest an increase in UAP activity or reporting from South America in June 2025. The general increase in UAP discussion in the U.S. does not necessarily translate to a higher reporting rate from South American pilots to this specific US-based database. For my forecast to increase, I would need to see evidence of a localized 'flap' of sightings in South America or a new initiative by a regional aviation body encouraging reporting to NUFORC. Conversely, my forecast would decrease if new information suggested NUFORC was having issues with its reporting system or was no longer accepting international reports.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in South America in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) a sighting in Brazil in December 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
