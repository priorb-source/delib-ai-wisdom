    "review": "The other forecasters raised several important considerations I hadn't fully explored. Forecaster 2 provided valuable context about DOGE's existing use of questionable accounting methods (double-counting, zombie contracts), which actually strengthens the case they have tools to reach $200B. However, they also importantly highlighted the countervailing scrutiny from major media and watchdog groups, which represents a real reputational risk. Forecaster 3 raised a critical point I missed: the institutional shift with Musk stepping back and DOGE being absorbed into OMB/Treasury. This changes the dynamics significantly - it could either slow claims through more conservative vetting OR accelerate them through OMB's ability to frame multi-year savings. Forecaster 3 also noted we may have less certainty about the current exact tally than my assistant's report suggested, and that the July 4th timing presents unique political communication value. Both forecasters landed near my original 60% (one at 60%, one at 55%), suggesting reasonable convergence on the uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm making a modest downward adjustment from 60% to 58%. The institutional changes Forecaster 3 highlighted introduce more uncertainty about the trajectory than my simple extrapolation model captured. The integration into OMB/Treasury under Russell Vought could dampen the aggressive pace of new claims, especially if there's more conservative vetting. While Forecaster 2's point about existing aggressive accounting methods suggests DOGE has the capability to claim $200B if they choose, the scrutiny risk is real - a major exposé before July 1st could force more defensible numbers. However, I'm not moving much lower because: (1) they only need $25B more from $175B, (2) the political incentive remains strong with July 4th approaching, (3) these are self-reported claims with methodological flexibility, and (4) evidence suggests they're already willing to use aggressive accounting. The balance of slightly increased uncertainty about institutional dynamics and pace deceleration warrants a small decrease, but the fundamentals still favor a modest probability they'll claim $200B.",
