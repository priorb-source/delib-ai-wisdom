    "review": "All three forecasters have reached a strong consensus on the key factors driving this forecast: the prohibitive legal context following the 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling, the extremely short time frame before the July 1 deadline, and the Scottish Government's current strategic focus on domestic policy rather than an imminent referendum. The arguments raised by the other forecasters align almost perfectly with my own initial analysis. The only notable difference is the small variation in probability between my 2% and Forecaster 3's 5%, which reflects a slightly different weighing of the low-probability scenario of a purely symbolic or political announcement. I find their reasoning convincing and it serves to reinforce my confidence in my initial assessment.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other expert analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 2%. The deliberation process confirmed that the primary drivers I identified are shared by my colleagues, strengthening my conviction. Both Forecaster 2 and 3 correctly point out that the legal obstacles, the Scottish Government's recent pivot to domestic policy, influential statements from figures like Nicola Sturgeon, and the practical constraints of the timeline (including the by-election announcement embargo until June 5) make an announcement highly improbable. Forecaster 3's slightly higher forecast of 5% accounts for the possibility of a 'strategic move to rally its base.' While I agree this is the most plausible scenario for a 'Yes' outcome, I believe a 2% probability (a 1-in-50 chance) more accurately reflects the high political risk and strategic imprudence of such a move for the Scottish Government in the immediate two-month window. Announcing a referendum they cannot legally hold, without consistent and overwhelming public support, would likely backfire and contradict their stated focus on the economy and public services. The upcoming 2026 Holyrood election remains the more logical and strategic focal point for their independence platform. Therefore, the combined weight of evidence continues to support an extremely low probability.",
