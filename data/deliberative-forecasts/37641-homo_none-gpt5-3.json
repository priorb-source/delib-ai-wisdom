    "review": "Both forecasters correctly highlight the tight timeline and the exchange-specific resolution criterion. Forecaster 2 leans on implied momentum and assumes (implicitly) that NYSE is the intended venue, landing at 70%. Forecaster 3 gives more weight to venue uncertainty and the risk of a minor slip past July 1, ending at 35%. Neither introduced new hard evidence (e.g., SEC effectiveness, announced roadshow, confirmed NYSE ticker), so the key divergence is how much to penalize for exchange uncertainty and timing risk. I find Forecaster 3’s emphasis on exchange risk and the binary cutoff date compelling; Forecaster 2’s optimism is plausible if NYSE is already specified in filings, but we don’t have that confirmation here.",
    "rationale": "As of May 14, there are ~7 weeks left—enough time for a roadshow and pricing if Circle’s S-1 is near-effective and the window remains open. June listings are feasible for marquee names, and sentiment toward crypto/stablecoins in 2025 appears constructive per the Forbes framing. However, the question resolves Yes only if Circle trades on the NYSE before July 1. Without explicit confirmation of NYSE and with no roadshow or effectiveness signal provided, venue risk and execution/timing risk are material. I previously set 65% assuming a likely Q2 path and lower venue risk. After considering the deliberation, I’m shading down to reflect (1) meaningful probability of a different exchange and (2) how small process delays can push beyond the deadline. If we later get SEC effectiveness, a launched roadshow, and NYSE/ticker confirmation, I would move up materially; conversely, any delay chatter or a Nasdaq venue would drop this sharply.",
