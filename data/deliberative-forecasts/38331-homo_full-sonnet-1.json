    "review": "All three forecasters independently arrived at 93%, demonstrating strong consensus on the risk profile. Forecaster 2 provided helpful specifics on blocking dates (China 2009, Iran 2009, Russia 2022), which reinforces how deeply entrenched these policies are. Forecaster 3 made a valid observation about Myanmar and Venezuela being potentially less stable, though even this doesn't materially change the 26-day timeframe analysis. The convergence is reassuring rather than concerning - it suggests we're all correctly identifying similar base rates and risk factors. All analyses appropriately emphasized: (1) the short 26-day window, (2) the authoritarian nature of all seven regimes, (3) the lack of any signals about policy changes, and (4) Wikipedia-related uncertainties. The admin discretion clause for edit wars, which all forecasters noted, actually reduces the Wikipedia risk somewhat. No forecaster identified risks I hadn't considered that would justify updating significantly.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I remain confident in my 93% forecast. The key supporting factors are: (1) Exceptionally short 26-day timeframe - too brief for meaningful policy reversals without prior signals; (2) All seven countries are deeply authoritarian with multi-year blocks already in place; (3) No indication in the research report of any relevant policy discussions; (4) Recent blocking activity elsewhere (Tanzania) shows the global trend hasn't shifted toward liberalization; (5) Admin discretion on edit wars reduces Wikipedia-related risks. The 7% uncertainty accounts for: Wikipedia article reorganization or unexpected edits (3-4%), tail-risk political developments in Myanmar or Venezuela (2-3%), and other unforeseen issues (1%). The requirement for ALL seven to remain listed does create vulnerability, but given the stability of these regimes and the short window, this doesn't justify lowering the forecast. I see no compelling arguments to update either direction.",
