  "information": "Seat projection models, including Canada388 and The Writ, estimate the Bloc Québécois will win between 19 and 25 seats. Projections for the Conservative Party place their seat count between 10 and 12. The increase in Liberal support is reported to primarily affect the Bloc's vote share rather than the Conservatives'. The Conservative party's support is most concentrated in the Quebec City region and its south shore.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months, as the election is mandated to occur on or before October 20, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Based on the last two federal elections (2019 and 2021) where the Bloc Québécois won 32 seats to the Conservatives' 10, and current seat projection models showing a similar gap, the status quo is a decisive Bloc victory in this head-to-head comparison.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A strong national wave for the Conservative Party extends into Quebec, allowing them to capitalize on voter fatigue with the incumbent Liberals and the Bloc. The Conservatives successfully rebrand themselves on key issues for Quebecers, leading to an unprecedented breakthrough in regions like Saguenay and Mauricie, while the Bloc's support crumbles under pressure from both the Conservatives and a resurgent Liberal party.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Bloc Québécois maintains its position as the primary voice for Quebec's interests in Ottawa, holding onto its strongholds in francophone regions. The Conservative party's support remains geographically concentrated in and around Quebec City and the Beauce region, failing to make the broad gains necessary to challenge the Bloc's province-wide seat count. Voting patterns largely mirror those of the 2021 election.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on strong historical precedent and current polling data. In the last two federal elections, the Bloc Québécois (BQ) has consistently won over three times as many seats as the Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) in Quebec (32 to 10 in both 2019 and 2021). Current seat projection models provided by my research assistant reinforce this trend, estimating 19-25 seats for the BQ versus 10-12 for the CPC. Even at the most favorable end for the Conservatives, the BQ still maintains a lead of at least 7 seats. The CPC's support is historically and currently concentrated in specific regions (Quebec City, Beauce), and expanding beyond this base has proven exceptionally difficult. While reporting suggests a potential Liberal surge could hurt the BQ, this does not directly translate into gains for the CPC. My probability is not higher than 85% because an election is still approximately six months away, allowing for significant shifts. A powerful national CPC momentum could have unpredictable spillover effects in Quebec, potentially convincing strategic voters that the CPC is the only viable alternative to the Liberals. My probability is not lower because the BQ's structural advantages and the CPC's historical ceiling in Quebec are formidable obstacles to overcome. For me to lower my forecast, I would need to see sustained polling showing the CPC making significant inroads into BQ strongholds across multiple regions of the province.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Bloc Québécois win more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Carney’s Surge in Quebec Could Wipe the Sovereigntist Party Off the Map](https://thewalrus.ca/carneys-surge-in-quebec-could-wipe-the-sovereigntist-party-off-the-map/) | [In Quebec City, a Conservative candidate cannot run and the Bloc is benefitting](https://nationalpost.com/news/in-quebec-city-a-conservative-candidate-cannot-run-and-the-bloc-is-benefitting)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Bloc Québécois party wins more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party of Canada in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election). If it wins the same or fewer seats, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeat projection models, including Canada388 and The Writ, estimate the Bloc Québécois will win between 19 and 25 seats.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
