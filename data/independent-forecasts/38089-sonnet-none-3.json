    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The outcome depends on the current relative approval ratings between Sánchez and Erdoğan in Morning Consult's tracking data, which I don't have access to beyond the January 2025 reference",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Erdoğan maintains or improves his approval rating relative to Sánchez. This could occur if Turkey's economic situation stabilizes, if Erdoğan scores foreign policy wins, or if Sánchez faces domestic political crises such as coalition instability or additional scandals affecting his administration",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sánchez maintains a higher approval rating than Erdoğan. This could occur if Turkey's ongoing economic challenges (high inflation, currency weakness) continue to erode Erdoğan's support, while Spain's relatively more stable economic situation helps Sánchez maintain his current approval levels",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires comparing two leaders without access to their current Morning Consult approval ratings. Key factors to consider: Turkey has faced persistent economic challenges including high inflation and currency depreciation, which typically depress leader approval ratings. Erdoğan has been in power since 2003, and long-serving leaders often experience approval fatigue, though he demonstrated continued electoral support in winning the 2023 presidential election. Spain, while facing its own challenges, has been economically more stable than Turkey. Sánchez has faced controversies but operates in a stable democratic system. With only 33 days until resolution, dramatic shifts are unlikely, suggesting the status quo relationship will likely persist. However, without the specific January 2025 baseline data mentioned, I'm operating with significant uncertainty. The probability isn't higher because Erdoğan has shown resilience and could maintain competitive approval levels despite challenges. The probability isn't lower because Turkey's structural economic difficulties create headwinds for Erdoğan's approval. I would update this forecast higher if I learned Sánchez currently has a substantial lead in the ratings, or if Turkey's economy showed further deterioration. I would update lower if data showed Erdoğan currently leading, or if Spain faced new political crises.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Pedro Sánchez has a higher approval rating than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
