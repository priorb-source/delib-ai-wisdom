  "information": "In the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections, the Bloc Québécois won 32 seats in Quebec, while the Conservative Party of Canada won 10 seats in each of those elections. Historically, the Bloc has won more seats in Quebec than the Conservatives in the last five to seven elections.\n\nRecent polling data shows a shift in voter support in Quebec. Bloc Québécois support has declined from 37% to a range of 23-27%. Conservative support has remained stable at approximately 23%. The Liberal Party has seen its support surge to between 40-42%. Aggregated polls from sources like Nanos, CROP, Abacus Data, and Ipsos show the Bloc leading the Conservatives by 5 to 17 percentage points province-wide.\n\nSeat projection models, including Canada388 and The Writ, estimate the Bloc Québécois will win between 19 and 25 seats. Projections for the Conservative Party place their seat count between 10 and 12. The increase in Liberal support is reported to primarily affect the Bloc's vote share rather than the Conservatives'. The Conservative party's support is most concentrated in the Quebec City region and its south shore.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 months. The 2025 Canadian federal election is scheduled for October 20, 2025, and today is April 21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the Bloc Québécois wins more seats than the Conservative Party in Quebec. Historically, the Bloc has dominated the Conservatives in Quebec, winning 32 seats to the Conservatives' 10 in both 2019 and 2021 elections.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party wins the same number or more seats than the Bloc in Quebec. This could occur if Conservative support surges significantly beyond its current ~23% level, the Bloc's decline accelerates dramatically, or if the Liberal surge disproportionately collapses Bloc seat counts while Conservatives consolidate their Quebec City stronghold and expand beyond their regional base.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Bloc Québécois maintains its seat advantage over the Conservatives. Current seat projection models show the Bloc winning 19-25 seats compared to the Conservatives' 10-12 seats, maintaining roughly a 2:1 advantage despite the Bloc's decline from 37% to 23-27% support.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. The Bloc has won more seats than the Conservatives in the last 5-7 elections, with a commanding 32-10 advantage in both 2019 and 2021. While the Bloc has experienced significant polling decline (from 37% to 23-27%), current seat projection models from Canada388 and The Writ still estimate they will win nearly twice as many seats as the Conservatives (19-25 vs 10-12). The research shows that aggregated polling data gives the Bloc a 5-17 point lead province-wide, and the Liberal surge to 40-42% is primarily affecting the Bloc rather than the Conservatives. The Conservative Party's support remains geographically concentrated in the Quebec City region, limiting their ability to win seats across the province. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the Bloc has lost significant support, declining by roughly 10-14 percentage points, (2) there are 6 months until the election, providing time for further shifts, and (3) Mark Carney's Liberal surge could further erode Bloc support. My forecast is not lower because: (1) seat projections still show a substantial Bloc advantage, (2) historical precedent is extremely strong, (3) Conservative support remains stable but geographically limited at ~23%, and (4) the Bloc maintains polling leads even after their decline. I would update higher if: polling shows Bloc stabilization or recovery, or if Conservatives remain stuck at ~23% with no geographic expansion. I would update lower if: Conservative support surges significantly, Bloc continues declining, or seat projections narrow substantially.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
