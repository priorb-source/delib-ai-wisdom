    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 23 days until June 27, 2025, when the final Friday of June 2025 report is expected to be released",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Consumer sentiment stays at or above 54.0. Historically, the Index rarely falls below 54.0 except in extreme circumstances. Even during recessions and economic stress, the index typically remains above this threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment stabilizes or improves from current levels as the initial shock of tariff concerns moderates. Economic fundamentals like employment remain relatively stable. The June final reading comes in at 54.0 or higher, consistent with historical patterns where sentiment rarely drops to such extreme lows.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Tariff impacts worsen significantly, causing severe economic disruption and panic. A major negative economic shock occurs in June. Consumer confidence collapses to levels matching or exceeding the historic June 2022 low of approximately 50. The final June reading drops below 54.0, representing one of the worst sentiment readings in the index's history.",
    "rationale": "The threshold of 54.0 represents an extremely low level for consumer sentiment that has only been reached a handful of times in the index's history. The all-time low was approximately 50.0 in June 2022 during peak inflation concerns. While the Axios article reference suggests recent tariff-related sentiment challenges, reaching a level below 54.0 would require conditions comparable to the worst economic crises. The status quo strongly favors sentiment remaining at or above this threshold. Without specific data on May 2025 or early June preliminary numbers, I must weight heavily toward historical base rates showing sentiment below 54 is exceptionally rare. For my forecast to be higher, I would need evidence that May or early June preliminary readings were already in the 50-53 range, indicating imminent risk of falling below 54. For my forecast to be lower, I would need data showing current sentiment is well above 60, which is more typical even during economic stress. The extreme nature of the threshold and historical rarity of such low readings justify a low probability, though the tariff concerns and mentioned plunge prevent assigning near-zero probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be less than 54.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is less than 54.0 for June 2025. Greater than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
