  "information": "Several regional weather events were reported globally during May 2025. In Ahmedabad, India, the month was one of the coolest in recent years, with an average maximum temperature 3.3 degrees Celsius below normal due to record rainfall. In contrast, Europe experienced several heat events. On May 1, the UK recorded its warmest start to May on record with temperatures reaching 28°C. Scotland saw its hottest day of the year so far on May 13, reaching 25.4°C. On May 30, a heatwave in Brittany, France broke local heat records for May, reaching 31.1°C in La Noë-Blanche. In the United States, International Falls, Minnesota, recorded temperatures around +32°C in early May.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 weeks (NOAA typically posts the Global Climate Report and updates Climate at a Glance in mid-June).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rapid ENSO cooling and dataset-specific differences lead NOAA’s Land+Ocean series to place May 2025 just below May 2024 (e.g., 2nd warmest) by a few hundredths of a degree.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Exceptionally warm global sea-surface temperatures and continued broad land warmth keep the global May 2025 anomaly slightly above May 2024 in NOAA’s dataset (including the possibility of a tie that still displays as rank 1).",
    "rationale": "Context: Since mid-2023, global temperatures have been persistently extreme, with many consecutive monthly records across major datasets. Ocean warmth has been the dominant driver, and monthly global means typically lag ENSO changes by a few months. Even as El Niño fades toward neutral and likely La Niña later in 2025, May is early in that transition and ocean temperatures have remained historically high. Status quo therefore favors another record or near-record month. Evidence and weighting: • Status quo outcome: Multiple recent months (late 2023 through early 2025) have been record-warm in NOAA and other datasets. This persistence suggests May 2025 is more likely than not to challenge or exceed May 2024. • Drivers: Global SSTs are still very elevated, North Atlantic warmth remains anomalous, and lingering radiative forcings (e.g., reduced sulfate aerosols, added stratospheric water vapor from Hunga Tonga) continue to support high anomalies. • Counterpoints: The transition away from El Niño could shave a few hundredths of a degree from monthly anomalies versus 2024. NOAA’s dataset can diverge slightly from ERA5/C3S and others; the margin separating rank 1 and 2 Mays is typically small, so minor methodological or spatial differences could push May 2025 to 2nd. Research assistant’s inputs: Regional variability was mixed (e.g., cooler-than-normal in parts of India due to heavy rainfall; notable European and some U.S. heat). These local signals are consistent with a very warm globe dominated by ocean warmth; they don’t materially undercut the global warm baseline. Why not higher: Small ranking margins and NOAA-specific differences make a second-place finish plausible if ENSO-related cooling or regional cool anomalies over-weighted ocean areas. Why not lower: The overwhelming recent pattern of record warmth and sustained, near-record SSTs point toward another record or near-record May. What would shift my view: • Upward: Early reanalyses (e.g., ERA5, JRA-55), Berkeley Earth previews, or global daily SST metrics indicating May 2025 clearly above May 2024. • Downward: Preliminary reports showing a notable dip in global ocean warmth in May or early-month NOAA summaries suggesting May ranks 2nd in their Land+Ocean series.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA report that May 2025 is the hottest May on record?\n\nQuestion background:\n[NOAA Climate change impacts](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NOAA at its [Climate at a Glance Global Rankings](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/rankings/globe/tavg/land_ocean/202504) tracker reports that May 2025 is the 1st warmest on record.\n\nEnsure that Region is set to Global. Ensure that Surface is set to Land and Ocean.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral regional weather events were reported globally during May 2025. In Ahmedabad, India, the month was one of the coolest in recent years, with an average maximum temperature 3.3 degrees Celsius below normal due to record rainfall.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
