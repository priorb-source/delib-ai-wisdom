  "information": "According to multiple news reports from late May 2025, former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo is considered disqualified from the 2025 presidential election. This is due to a 2018 conviction for the looting of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), which resulted in a 20-year prison sentence and the loss of his civic rights. Sources such as Le Point, tunisienumerique.com, and Abidjan.net state that he remains struck from the electoral list. His political party, the People's African Party-Côte d'Ivoire (PPA-CI), announced in late April 2025 that it would evaluate the situation in the first half of June 2025 and consider a 'new level in the fight' if his status on the electoral list does not change.\n\nThe political climate in Côte d'Ivoire is marked by the disqualification of several opposition figures ahead of the October 2025 election. In April 2025, Tidjane Thiam, leader of the main opposition party PDCI-RDA, was disqualified after a court ruled he did not meet eligibility conditions due to his prior dual French-Ivorian nationality, despite having renounced his French citizenship. This and other exclusions have led to protests and accusations of electoral manipulation. Reports also mention that other political figures like Charles Blé Goudé and Guillaume Soro have been excluded from the electoral process due to judicial convictions. In response to the political tensions, various groups, including religious leaders and the UN, have called for peaceful dialogue.\n\nSeveral of the candidates named in the question have officially announced their intention to run in the 2025 presidential election. Jean-Louis Billon, a member of the PDCI-RDA party, announced his candidacy in late May 2025, positioning himself as an alternative within his party following the disqualification of its leader, Tidjane Thiam. Simone Gbagbo, former first lady, has also announced her candidacy under the banner of her party, the Movement of Capable Generations (MGC). Pascal Affi N'Guessan is also presented as a candidate for the FPI party.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with a resolution date of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The question resolves as 'Yes' because former President Laurent Gbagbo is currently considered disqualified and has been removed from the electoral list, a status that is expected to persist.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "For a 'No' outcome, Laurent Gbagbo would need to be officially reinstated on the electoral list before July 1, 2025, likely via a presidential pardon or an unexpected court ruling. Additionally, none of the other four specified candidates would be disqualified during this period.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current situation persists, and Laurent Gbagbo remains struck from the electoral list due to his 2018 conviction, thus confirming his legal ineligibility to run in the 2025 election. This scenario alone would trigger a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong evidence that one of the named candidates, Laurent Gbagbo, is already legally disqualified. The research report, citing multiple news sources from late May 2025, states that Gbagbo remains struck from the electoral list due to a 2018 conviction that led to the loss of his civic rights. This existing state of ineligibility directly satisfies the resolution criteria. The political climate in Côte d'Ivoire reinforces this assessment, as other prominent opposition figures, such as Tidjane Thiam, have also been recently disqualified, indicating a trend of exclusion rather than inclusion of presidential rivals. For the outcome to be 'No', Gbagbo's status would need to be reversed before July 1, which would require a significant political or judicial event, such as a presidential pardon. Given the short timeframe and the government's current stance, such a reversal is highly improbable. My forecast is not 100% because there is always a small, non-zero chance of an unexpected political maneuver aimed at reducing tensions. However, the probability is not lower because the evidence for Gbagbo's disqualification is direct, recent, and affirmed by multiple sources, making it the clear status quo. I would lower my forecast if President Ouattara publicly signaled intent to grant Gbagbo amnesty or if a high court agreed to review his case on an expedited basis. I would raise it if Ivorian electoral authorities make another official statement in June confirming his ineligibility.",
