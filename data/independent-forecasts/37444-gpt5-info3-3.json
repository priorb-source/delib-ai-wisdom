  "information": "The European Union has expressed a lack of interest in restoring the pipeline's operation, and is reportedly preparing new sanctions against Russia. Nord Stream 2 AG has also faced legal and financial setbacks in Europe. In April 2025, a German court upheld a bank's decision to terminate the company's accounts due to U.S. sanctions risks. The company is operating under a moratorium on bankruptcy in Switzerland and has been making payments to small creditors to facilitate a larger financial settlement. One of the two pipeline strings was severely damaged in an attack in September 2022.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 weeks (roughly 56 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Nord Stream 2 AG remains on OFAC’s SDN List by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The White House debate stalls or opts against delisting; EU remains uninterested in restoring NS2; no major Ukraine breakthrough occurs; Treasury/OFAC keeps NS2 AG on the SDN list to maintain leverage and avoid political backlash; company continues in legal/financial limbo.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Administration decides to delist Nord Stream 2 AG as part of a broader policy shift or a negotiation package (e.g., a ceasefire-related sanctions swap), and OFAC executes the removal before July 1. Alternatively, a rapid, unexpected decision to ease select Russia energy sanctions includes NS2 AG specifically.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The company has been on the SDN List since 2022 and remains so as of May 2025. With only ~2 months left, the default is inertia. The reported internal White House debate (Politico, Apr 23) raises the chance above near-zero, but concrete signals of a decision are absent. The research assistant’s points all favor the status quo: the EU is not interested in reviving the pipeline, the EU is preparing new sanctions, NS2 AG faces ongoing legal and financial constraints (German court upholding bank account termination due to U.S. sanctions risk; Swiss bankruptcy moratorium), and one of the two strings was severely damaged in 2022. These factors reduce the policy payoff from delisting and increase the political costs of doing so.   Why not higher: Delisting a high-profile Russian energy entity amid an ongoing war, without a major diplomatic trade, is politically costly and yields little near-term energy benefit (NS2 is a gas pipeline with impaired infrastructure and no EU demand). Past Russia-related delistings have been rare and typically required complex arrangements or major strategic shifts, which are unlikely to be conceived and executed within weeks.   Why not lower: The Politico reporting suggests a live policy discussion in the White House about lifting certain Russia energy sanctions, which keeps a non-trivial tail risk. The current administration could, in principle, act unilaterally and quickly if it views the move as part of a broader strategy.   Up/Down updates: I would raise the probability if (1) credible leaks or official statements indicate a decision to ease Russia energy sanctions imminently, (2) signs of a Ukraine ceasefire framework tied to sanctions relief emerge, (3) Treasury/OFAC starts delisting other Russian entities as precedent, or (4) Germany/EU unexpectedly signal receptivity to NS2-related changes. I would lower it if (1) the U.S. or EU roll out new Russia sanctions packages, (2) Congress moves to constrain sanctions relief on Russian energy, (3) the war escalates, or (4) Germany/EU publicly warn against any NS2-related sanctions easing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe European Union has expressed a lack of interest in restoring the pipeline's operation, and is reportedly preparing new sanctions against Russia.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
