  "information": "International reactions to the political situation in Republika Srpska are varied. The U.S. and EU have expressed strong opposition to secession, with a U.S. envoy labeling RS's proposals as \"secession by another name.\" The U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo has warned that disobeying the decisions of Bosnia's Constitutional Court, such as celebrating the banned January 9th holiday, may constitute a criminal offense. In contrast, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenković has expressed support for Bosnia and Herzegovina's EU membership while voicing concern over secessionist rhetoric from RS, warning that delays in EU integration could allow Russia and China to increase their influence. Russia has appeared supportive of moves by RS, and a Russian military documentary film festival was scheduled to take place in Banja Luka in May 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 59 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Republika Srpska (RS) leadership continues secessionist rhetoric and legal obstruction but stops short of formally setting a referendum date to avoid harsher EU/US sanctions and economic fallout. Serbia withholds explicit backing, EUFOR/High Representative deterrence holds, and the RS National Assembly never votes to set a date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A flashpoint (e.g., adverse court rulings, High Representative interventions, arrests or new sanctions on RS leadership) prompts Milorad Dodik to escalate. He convenes the RS National Assembly to pass a decision setting a specific date for an independence referendum—possibly tied to a symbolic date later in 2025—and publicly announces it, or he announces a date himself under RS authority. Even if Bosnia and Herzegovina’s central institutions declare it illegal, the announcement by RS authorities would satisfy the criterion.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the status quo is sticky. Over nearly two decades, RS leaders—especially Dodik—have repeatedly threatened an independence referendum but have consistently avoided crossing the line of officially setting a date, except for less consequential votes (e.g., RS Day) where costs were lower. Announcing a date would trigger immediate and predictable costs: tighter US/EU sanctions, loss of EU funds and momentum on Bosnia’s EU path, reputational damage, and possible stronger measures from the High Representative and EUFOR. Serbia has generally discouraged a formal break, and RS’s economy is too interwoven with EU markets to absorb a sharp escalation easily. With only ~2 months left, the base rate for such an announcement is very low.\n\nAt the same time, the risk isn’t zero. Dodik’s pattern of brinkmanship means he could use an announcement as leverage, especially if provoked by legal or political shocks. The threshold for our resolution is relatively low: any authorized RS authority publicly setting a date—even for later in 2025—would count. Symbolic windows (e.g., late June) could be tempting for a surprise move. Russia’s supportive posture and cultural signaling (e.g., a Russian military film festival in Banja Luka in May 2025 noted by the research assistant) slightly raise tail risk, but they don’t materially offset Western deterrence.\n\nResearch assistant highlights affecting the forecast:\n- Strong US/EU opposition, with US calling RS moves “secession by another name,” and warnings about criminal liability for defying the Constitutional Court. This depresses the probability.\n- Croatia backs BiH’s EU path and voices concern over RS rhetoric—another sign of EU cohesion against secessionist steps.\n- Russia appears supportive and active in RS public sphere (e.g., the film festival), marginally increasing escalation risk but not enough to outweigh costs.\n\nWhy not higher? Because the decisive step—formally setting a date—has been the line RS has avoided for years due to immediate, severe international consequences and Serbia’s reluctance to endorse secession. The short remaining window further reduces odds.\n\nWhy not lower? Dodik has shown willingness to defy constraints when he believes it benefits him domestically. Any acute confrontation (court verdicts, High Representative actions, arrests, or new sanctions) could catalyze a date announcement as a retaliatory gambit.\n\nWhat would move me up: credible reports of an NSRS session to vote on a referendum, Serbia signaling tolerance/support, a major confrontation with Sarajevo or the High Representative, or coordinated Russian-Serbian political cover.\n\nWhat would move me down: fresh EU incentives tied to de-escalation, signs of RS budgetary strain from existing sanctions, explicit pushback by Belgrade, or conciliatory statements by Dodik walking back referendum talk.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nInternational reactions to the political situation in Republika Srpska are varied.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
