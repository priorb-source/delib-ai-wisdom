    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses closely align with mine, with all three of us arriving independently at 28-30%. This convergence is notable and suggests we're capturing the key factors appropriately. Forecaster 2 and 3 both emphasized the 'status quo bias' principle more explicitly than I did - the fact that a full month has passed since licensing with no change to 'Not Available' status is indeed strong negative evidence when only 6.5 weeks remain. They also clearly articulated what would need to change our forecasts: concrete signals of imminent activation (terminal distribution, specific dates, map status changes). I find this framing helpful. Their analyses don't introduce fundamentally new evidence, but they do reinforce the bearish case by emphasizing how much of the available time window has already elapsed without progress. The Bangladesh precedent remains the main counterargument, but all three of us appropriately noted this might be an outlier rather than the new normal. The operational challenges specific to Somalia (security, logistics, payment infrastructure) combined with the unfavorable base rate (4-8 months typical for African rollouts) continue to dominate the analysis.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I remain confident in my original reasoning. The convergence at 28-30% across independent analyses validates the core logic: the base rate strongly suggests this won't happen by July 1 (4-8 month typical timeline vs 2.5 months available), but there's meaningful upside risk from the Bangladesh precedent and high-level political backing. The emphasis on status quo bias by the other forecasters is well-taken - with one month elapsed and no status change, we're now 40% through the available window with no movement. This reinforces the bearish case. However, I don't find this sufficient to warrant lowering my forecast further because: (1) the Bangladesh 2-week rollout proves rapid deployment is technically possible when prioritized, (2) US diplomatic backing and Musk's personal announcement suggest potential prioritization, and (3) technical readiness exists via inter-satellite links. The probability remains in the 25-30% range - low enough to reflect the unfavorable timeline and base rate, high enough to account for the possibility of expedited treatment. I see no compelling reason to deviate from my original 28% assessment.",
