    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (roughly 5.5 weeks)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discord continues preparing privately, perhaps with a confidential SEC filing, but does not make a public S-1 filing or a specific IPO announcement on its news blog before June 30. Plans slip to late summer or fall, in line with typical IPO seasonality.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Discord publicly files an S-1 in June, or posts a clear, specific announcement on the Discord news blog that it is planning an IPO (e.g., on the same day the S-1 goes public).",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and setup: The background article suggests Discord is targeting a 2025 IPO and has lined up banks, which indicates serious intent. However, the resolution criteria require either a publicly visible S-1 or a specific announcement on Discord’s news blog before July 1. A confidential filing would not count.\n- Timing and base rates: IPOs tend to cluster in windows (spring and early fall). Late June into July/August is often a lull, with many companies waiting until late August/September for public filings if they aim to list in the fall. Companies rarely pre-announce an IPO on their blog independent of an S-1 due to quiet-period norms. Thus, the most plausible path to Yes is a public S-1 in June.\n- Status quo weighting: As of May 23, no qualifying announcement has occurred. With only ~5.5 weeks left and seasonality working against a late-June move, the status quo favors No unless Discord accelerates.\n- Why not higher: Tight timeline, summer lull, and industry practice (blog announcements without an S-1 are uncommon). If they aim for a fall listing, a public S-1 may not appear until late August.\n- Why not lower: Credible reporting that Discord intends to go public in 2025 and has engaged major underwriters makes a June S-1 plausible, especially if market conditions are favorable and they want to build awareness ahead of a post-summer launch.\n- What would move the forecast up: Reliable reports of an imminent public S-1; indications of a June investor education timeline; a wave of tech S-1s hitting in June; or Discord adding investor-relations content or a placeholder on its site.\n- What would move the forecast down: Reporting that Discord is delaying to the fall or 2026; market volatility spikes; adverse company developments; or signs they pursue another private round instead of an IPO.\n- Research assistant input: No additional information provided beyond the background; thus, the estimate leans on industry timing norms and the reported 2025 intent.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
