    "review": "Both forecasters make strong status-quo arguments that I largely share. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the multi-step nature of ratification (legislative approval plus formal deposit with the AU Commission) and Libya’s fragmented institutions is well taken, and they appropriately weight the short, ~60-day window. Forecaster 3 adds a new claim about Libya prioritizing a significant Turkey bilateral trade deal; if accurate, that further reduces near-term bandwidth for AfCFTA ratification. I can’t independently verify that claim here, so I give it modest weight, but it points in the same direction: AfCFTA ratification is not currently a visible priority. Both note the lack of any public steps (cabinet/HoR action, scheduling, announcements), which is usually a leading indicator for imminent ratification. I agree with their caution against over-weighting continental momentum absent Libya-specific signals.",
    "rationale": "My prior (15%) leaned on pan-continental momentum and the possibility of a fast-track deposit if the executive pushed it through. After considering the other analyses, I think I overweighted those tail scenarios relative to the short timeline and Libya’s political coordination costs. In two months, absent clear signs (draft legislation, HoR agenda, ministerial statements, AU/AfCFTA Secretariat signaling), the base rate for moving from signed-not-ratified to deposited is low, especially for a divided polity. The reported focus on a Turkish trade initiative (if correct) further suggests limited administrative and political bandwidth for AfCFTA before July 1. I still keep a non-trivial tail for a rapid, symbolic move—e.g., a politically driven push to signal regional alignment or seize AU optics—but I reduce weight on that path without corroborating signals. Net: I lower my estimate modestly.",
