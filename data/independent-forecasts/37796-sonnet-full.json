  "information": "Several jurisdictions on the FATF grey list are actively seeking removal. The Nigerian government is working to exit the list by the end of May 2025, with its Minister of Interior emphasizing the administration's commitment to improving financial transparency. South Africa's National Treasury has stated that the country has addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 action items and aims to resolve the remaining two by June 2025, for a potential exit from the list by October 2025. Mozambique completed its technical reforms, and an FATF on-site visit, which is a prerequisite for removal, reportedly took place in April 2025 with positive feedback.\n\nThere are potential new additions to the grey list. The British Virgin Islands underwent a mutual-evaluation follow-up that found major gaps, and its grace period for remediation expired in February 2025; the UK has signalled it will not block a listing. Separately, India is preparing to submit new intelligence to the FATF concerning Pakistan's terror infrastructure, aiming to have Pakistan re-listed after its removal in October 2022. The most recent changes to the list occurred in February 2025, when Laos and Nepal were added and the Philippines was removed.\n\nHistorical data on FATF plenaries shows consistent changes to the grey list. Since the current monitoring process was adopted in 2018, there have been 17 plenary meetings up to February 2025. Of these 17 meetings, only one—the October 2020 plenary—concluded without any additions or removals. That session was a virtual meeting delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and was noted to have focused on policy work rather than country evaluations. For a country to be removed, it must complete its action plan and then undergo a successful on-site visit to verify the implementation of reforms.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-5 weeks. The FATF June 2025 Plenary meeting typically occurs in mid-to-late June, so the outcome should be known by early July 2025 at the latest.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the list changes. Historically, FATF plenaries have consistently resulted in changes to the grey list.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No jurisdictions are added or removed from the grey list. This would require all countries actively working toward removal (Nigeria, South Africa, Mozambique) to fail to complete their requirements or have unsuccessful on-site visits, and no new countries to be added despite British Virgin Islands' expired grace period and other potential additions. This would represent only the second time since 2018 that a plenary concluded without list changes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one jurisdiction is added to or removed from the grey list. This could occur through: (1) successful removal of one or more countries that have completed action plans and on-site visits, such as Mozambique (which had a positive on-site visit in April 2025), Nigeria (targeting May 2025 exit), or South Africa (20/22 action items completed); (2) addition of new jurisdictions like British Virgin Islands (grace period expired February 2025, UK won't block); or (3) re-listing of Pakistan based on Indian intelligence submissions.",
    "rationale": "The historical evidence strongly favors a Yes outcome. Since the current monitoring process began in 2018, there have been 17 plenary meetings through February 2025. Only one—October 2020—concluded without any changes to the grey list, and that was an exceptional virtual meeting during COVID-19 focused on policy work. This gives a 94% historical base rate for list changes. The most recent plenary in February 2025 followed this pattern, removing Philippines and adding Laos and Nepal. Multiple specific factors support changes at the June 2025 plenary: Mozambique completed its on-site visit in April 2025 with positive feedback, which is the final prerequisite for removal; Nigeria has explicitly targeted an exit by end of May 2025; South Africa has completed 20 of 22 action items with June 2025 as its completion target; and British Virgin Islands is a strong candidate for addition after its grace period expired in February 2025. However, I'm not forecasting higher because: the tight timelines for some countries (Nigeria's May deadline may be ambitious); South Africa officially targets October 2025 for removal, not June; and on-site visits must be 'successful' rather than just completed. Additionally, we're still 3-5 weeks from the meeting, allowing time for delays or complications. I'm not forecasting lower because the overwhelming historical precedent, multiple concrete candidates with documented progress, and continued pattern of changes (including the most recent February 2025 plenary) all point toward list modifications. To revise upward, I would need official FATF announcements or confirmations of completed successful on-site visits. To revise downward, I would need evidence that all removal candidates have failed to meet requirements and no additions are planned.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
