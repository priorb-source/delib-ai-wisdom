    "review": "New elements from the other forecasters: (1) a concrete fundraising edge for Stoney (~$1.4M) and establishment/endorsement consolidation; (2) a March Stoney internal poll showing Stoney 16, Rouse 10, Hashmi 8 with 63% undecided; (3) a Northern Virginia dynamic where there’s no hometown candidate, implying a persuasion/air war advantage for the best-funded campaign. I largely agree with Forecaster 2’s structural framing and base-rate weighting; the six-way plurality increases variance but usually benefits the best-funded, broadest-name-ID candidate. Forecaster 3’s use of the internal poll is helpful for directionality (Stoney ahead, soft support), but I’d discount its level and timeliness; 35% for Rouse feels a bit high absent evidence of late momentum or independent polling. Overall, their inputs nudge me slightly down from my prior, but the huge undecided share and split field keep Rouse’s path very real.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Stoney appears to hold advantages in money, establishment backing, and likely name ID, consistent with being the modal winner in a six-way, low-turnout primary. The reported internal poll (though dated and biased) supports a modest Stoney lead with very soft preferences. Rouse’s path is through a strong Hampton Roads base, labor/progressive mobilization, and benefiting from central Virginia vote-splitting between Stoney and Hashmi, plus decent performance in NoVA. What keeps Rouse viable is the plurality threshold likely being in the mid-20s and the very high undecided share this late in the cycle—both increase the payoff to late GOTV and effective media spend. What limits him is the probable spending gap and statewide reach advantages for Stoney in a region (NoVA) that often dominates Democratic primaries. Net: I modestly reduce my estimate to reflect reaffirmed structural headwinds (fundraising and establishment consolidation), but I do not move as low as 25% because the field size and softness of support keep the outcome more volatile than a typical two- or three-way race.",
