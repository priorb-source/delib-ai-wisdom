    "review": "The other forecasters introduced several compelling arguments that I had not fully weighed, all of which strengthen the case for a 'No' resolution. Forecaster 2's focus on the recent $450M Series G funding round and the accompanying $200M tender offer is particularly convincing. These are concrete corporate actions that provide a long cash runway and employee liquidity, thereby reducing the primary motivations for an imminent IPO. Forecaster 3's introduction of the ongoing, high-profile lawsuit with Deel is another crucial point, as such legal uncertainties are typically resolved before a company enters the public market. Both analyses strongly reinforce my initial conclusion, which was based primarily on the CEO's public statements. While I find the reasoning of both forecasters to be sound and well-supported, I believe Forecaster 3's probability of 15% is slightly high given the powerful negative evidence they themselves presented.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. My initial reasoning was heavily based on CEO Parker Conrad's direct statements in May 2025 that an IPO was 'not imminent' and that profitability was a prerequisite. The deliberation has significantly strengthened my conviction in this forecast by adding two major pieces of evidence. First, as Forecaster 2 noted, the company just closed a $450 million Series G funding round and a $200 million tender offer. This is a classic move to extend the company's private runway and provide liquidity, making an IPO in the immediate aftermath—within the next five weeks—strategically nonsensical. Second, as Forecaster 3 pointed out, the ongoing lawsuit with competitor Deel creates a significant legal and reputational overhang that any company would prefer to resolve before undergoing the scrutiny of an IPO process. The combination of the CEO's explicit statements, recent strategic financial actions designed to delay a public offering, and a major unresolved legal issue makes an IPO announcement before July 1, 2025, extremely unlikely. The 5% probability accounts for highly improbable 'black swan' events, such as a secret dual-track process being activated due to a sudden and exceptionally favorable market window, but the overwhelming weight of evidence supports the 'No' outcome.",
