  "information": "A lobbying scandal involving Huawei has led to a probe by Belgian prosecutors. On June 5, 2025, EPP MEP Fulvio Martusciello was arrested in connection with the investigation. Authorities have also requested that the parliamentary immunity be lifted for at least four other MEPs. The Parliament's Committee on Legal Affairs was expected to vote on these immunity waivers in mid-June, with the full plenary potentially confirming the decision during its session from June 16-19. Citing the precedent set during the 'Qatargate' scandal, major political groups like the EPP, S&D, and Renew have signaled zero-tolerance positions on corruption.\n\nHistorically, the 705-seat European Parliament sees between 80 and 120 replacements over a five-year term, which averages to approximately 1-2 departures per month. This turnover can be due to a variety of reasons, including appointments to national posts, retirement, scandals, or health issues. The rate of departures is often higher during the first year of a new parliamentary term. Precedents from previous scandals are mixed; while events like 'Qatargate' did lead to resignations, some indicted MEPs, such as Eva Kaili and Marc Tarabella, resisted calls to step down for several months while legal proceedings were ongoing.\n\nResignations from the European Parliament frequently occur when a sitting MEP is appointed to a ministerial position within their national government. Following elections in several member states, new governments were in the process of being formed. Specifically, after the May 18 elections in Portugal, there were rumors that at least two MEPs were being considered for cabinet positions in the new government. Other countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium, also had fluid political circumstances that could lead to cabinet reshuffles.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, as no MEP has announced their resignation within the specified timeframe yet.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The MEPs implicated in the Huawei scandal, including the one already arrested, resist pressure and refuse to resign, similar to precedents set during the 'Qatargate' scandal. Simultaneously, government formation talks in member states like Portugal get delayed past June, and no unrelated resignations for personal or health reasons occur within the short 21-day resolution window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the vote to lift parliamentary immunity in mid-June, at least one of the MEPs involved in the Huawei scandal resigns due to intense political pressure from their party. Alternatively, as a new government is formed in Portugal following their May elections, a sitting MEP is appointed to a cabinet position and subsequently resigns from the European Parliament.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the convergence of three independent factors that increase the likelihood of a resignation within the 21-day window (June 10-30, 2025). First, the acute Huawei lobbying scandal is a significant catalyst. With one MEP arrested and immunity waiver requests for four others, there is immense political pressure for resignations. The planned parliamentary votes on immunity in mid-June fall squarely within the resolution period, serving as a clear focal point for this pressure. Second, routine political turnover provides another path to a 'Yes' outcome. The formation of a new government in Portugal after recent elections, with rumors of MEPs being considered for cabinet posts, is a concrete example of events that commonly lead to resignations. Third, the historical baseline turnover rate for the European Parliament (1-2 members per month) suggests a non-trivial probability of a resignation for unrelated reasons (e.g., health, other appointments) in any given three-week period. The probability is not higher because of two key uncertainties: 1) The MEP arrested on June 5 could resign *before* the resolution window opens on June 10, which would resolve the question as 'No'. 2) Precedent from past scandals shows that indicted MEPs can resist calls to resign for months to retain their immunity. The probability is not lower because for the outcome to be 'No', all three independent pathways—scandal, national appointments, and baseline turnover—must fail to produce a single resignation within the specified timeframe. This confluence of factors makes a resignation highly probable. I would increase my forecast if a major political group publicly calls for a specific MEP's resignation after June 9. I would decrease it if the arrested MEP resigns before June 10 or if the immunity votes are postponed until July.",
