    "review": "Both forecasters make a strong case for a lower probability than my initial 18%, emphasizing de-escalation dynamics after crises, the overlap with India’s diplomatic push through early June, and—crucially—the resolution criterion that excludes Pakistan-administered Kashmir. I find especially persuasive their point that if India retaliates to any June provocations, the default locus is the LoC/AJK rather than Pakistan proper, and that a strike into Punjab/KP/Sindh/Balochistan would likely require a fresh, high-salience trigger. An additional nuance they imply is the attribution threshold: for this to resolve Yes, Indian Armed Forces’ involvement would almost certainly need to be credibly reported or acknowledged, which further lowers odds for a limited/deniable action. Overall, their reasoning nudges me down from my prior estimate.",
    "rationale": "Timeframe: ~9 days until the June window opens and then 30 days of exposure. Status quo favors No given the May 10 DGMO ceasefire, planned withdrawals by end-May, and India’s ongoing diplomatic outreach (May 21–June 5). After a sharp flare-up, both sides have incentives—domestic and international—to consolidate calm. While India’s doctrine and delegated authority raise responsiveness to provocations, the most likely retaliatory avenues in June are along the LoC or inside Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which would not count. Crossing into Pakistan proper (Punjab/KP/Sindh/Balochistan) is rare and carries higher escalation risks; doing so during or right after a global diplomatic tour would undercut India’s messaging absent a major trigger. I’m updating downward primarily due to (1) the de-escalatory posture and withdrawals, (2) the early-June diplomatic window, (3) the criterion excluding AJK/LoC actions, and (4) the need for credible attribution to the Indian Armed Forces. Tail risk remains for a Balakot-style or artillery/air strike into Pakistan proper if: a mass-casualty terror attack in India is credibly tied to Pakistan-based groups; a deadly Pakistani drone/missile/artillery incident occurs on Indian territory along the IB; or the ceasefire/withdrawals collapse accompanied by public Indian preparations (NOTAMs, unusual IAF posture, emergency CCS meetings). In the absence of such triggers, No remains the base case.",
