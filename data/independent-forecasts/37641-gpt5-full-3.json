  "information": "Circle Internet Group, Inc. has filed a public S-1 application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an initial public offering (IPO), with plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol 'CRCL'. The initial confidential submission was in January 2024, with a public update on April 1, 2025. The lead underwriters include Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, and Deutsche Bank. This is Circle's second attempt to go public after a failed SPAC merger in 2021, which had valued the company at $9 billion. The current IPO valuation is estimated at $4 billion to $5 billion. As of mid-May 2025, the deal status is 'filed' but not yet 'active', with no road-show date or price range announced.\n\nCircle's main business is issuing the USDC stablecoin, which has a market capitalization of approximately $60 billion. The company's revenue is primarily generated from managing the reserve assets backing USDC, which produced $1.7 billion in income in 2024, accounting for 99.1% of total revenue. The company's financial performance has varied, reporting a net loss of $768.8 million in 2022 followed by a net income of $267.6 million in 2023. For 2024, Circle's revenue was $1.68 billion, while net income declined 42% to $155.7 million and adjusted EBITDA fell 29% to $285 million. A major expense in 2024 was $907.9 million paid to partner Coinbase for USDC distribution. The company's liquidity was $1.05 billion at the end of 2024.\n\nAccording to multiple reports in May 2025, Circle's IPO plans were paused or delayed due to market volatility, sometimes referred to as the 'Trump effect'. A May 12 article in Expansión specifically listed Circle among several companies putting IPO plans on hold. However, the market for fintech listings is not entirely closed, as exemplified by the IPO of eToro on May 13. The broader cryptocurrency sector saw venture capital funding double to $6 billion in Q1 2025 compared to the previous year, despite a drop in the number of deals. During the same quarter, the total market value of stablecoins increased by 12%. The regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S. remains under development.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 7 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Circle is not yet trading and there’s no announced roadshow or price range.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "SEC review and market volatility keep the deal in “filed” status through June; no S-1/A with a price range, no roadshow, and listing slips to Q3 or later.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Circle files an S-1/A with a price range by early-to-mid June, launches a 7–10 day roadshow, prices in late June, and begins trading on the NYSE (ticker CRCL) before June 30.",
    "rationale": "What we know: Circle publicly filed an S-1 (updated April 1, 2025) to list on the NYSE as CRCL with major banks as underwriters. As of mid-May, the deal is “filed” but not “active,” with no price range or roadshow announced. Multiple May reports suggest the IPO has been paused due to market volatility. Circle’s business (USDC) is large and profitable in 2023–24 due to interest income on reserves, but results softened in 2024 and the company has significant partner payouts (to Coinbase). Liquidity sits near $1B. Stablecoin sector momentum and crypto funding have improved, but the U.S. regulatory picture for stablecoins remains unsettled.\nTimeline mechanics: To trade by June 30, Circle would likely need to: (1) file an S-1/A with a price range and launch a roadshow no later than mid-June; (2) complete bookbuilding and price in late June; (3) commence trading before July 1. That’s feasible but tight, especially given current “paused” signals.\nWhy not higher: No visible signs of an imminent launch (no active status, no range, no roadshow), reports of a pause, and a narrow calendar window. Any fresh volatility or regulatory headline could push them to Q3.\nWhy not lower: The S-1 is on file, underwriters are lined up, and if the market window opens, a well-prepared issuer can move quickly. Crypto and stablecoin sentiment is comparatively constructive in 2025, which could unlock a late-June window.\nWhat would move me up: An S-1/A with a price range, roadshow announcements, the SEC declaring the S-1 effective, stabilization in broader markets (e.g., lower volatility), or credible reporting that the deal is targeting late June.\nWhat would move me down: Continued reports of a pause, absence of an S-1/A by early June, a spike in market volatility, adverse regulatory news for stablecoins, or negative financial/operational updates from Circle.",
