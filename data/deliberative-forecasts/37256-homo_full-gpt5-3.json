    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my baseline: the key headwinds are limited TNLA bandwidth, competing crises (oil shock, peace/election calendar, recent arrests), no visible AfCFTA bill on the order paper, and the extra timing risk of preparing and depositing the instrument with the AU. They also appropriately note the countervailing tailwinds (ministerial and business advocacy, EAC support, continental momentum) and the possibility of an executive fast‑track for a low‑cost, high‑symbolism ratification. The additions I found most useful were the explicit early‑warning indicators they would watch for (cabinet clearance/gazetting, instrument drafting by Foreign Affairs/Justice, AU/EAC signaling of an imminent deposit). However, neither presented new concrete evidence that changes the near‑term probability; their arguments are consistent with my prior view.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~60 days. To resolve Yes, South Sudan must (1) table and pass a ratification bill in the TNLA, (2) obtain presidential assent, and (3) prepare and deposit the instrument with the AU—each a potential delay point. Current signals: no AfCFTA bill on the TNLA calendar for May–June; the assembly’s low sitting frequency; fiscal and political distractions; and no budgeting for AfCFTA obligations—all reinforce a No‑leaning baseline. Tailwinds exist (Trade Minister’s April recommitment, Chamber of Commerce support, EAC technical engagement), and ratification can be staged as a symbolic step with implementation later, which preserves a non‑trivial upside if the presidency orders a fast‑track and coordinates an immediate deposit. The other forecasters’ reasoning aligns with this balance and does not introduce new data that would materially shift odds. Given that my initial estimate already accounted for the fast‑track tail and the administrative deposit risk, I’m keeping my forecast unchanged. Triggers that would move me up quickly: cabinet approval and tabling/gazetting of the bill; TNLA order paper scheduling with expedited readings; public commitments to a deposit date; reports that the instrument text is drafted; AU/EAC notices. Triggers that would move me down: continued absence from the TNLA agenda by mid‑June; adjournments; further instability; explicit deferral to post‑election timelines.",
