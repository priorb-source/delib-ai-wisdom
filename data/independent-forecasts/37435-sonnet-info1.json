  "information": "Chegg Inc. received a non-compliance notice from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) because its stock price fell below the minimum average closing price of $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, trading around $0.51-$0.65 as of early May 2025. The company has a six-month period to regain compliance, with potential measures including a reverse stock split. Chegg is scheduled to release its Q1 2025 financial results on May 12, 2025. Analyst predictions for the quarter include earnings of $0.01 per share and revenue of $114.77 million.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "57 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Chegg does not file for bankruptcy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Chegg continues operations despite financial difficulties, reports Q1 results on May 12 that show challenges but not catastrophic losses, manages debt obligations, potentially implements reverse stock split to address NYSE compliance, and continues as a going concern through July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Chegg's Q1 results reveal severe liquidity crisis or massive losses, triggering covenant violations or inability to meet debt obligations, forcing management to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition before July 1 to protect the company and restructure operations.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors NO. Bankruptcy is typically a last resort that companies pursue only when facing immediate insolvency or inability to service debt. While Chegg is clearly in severe distress - evidenced by the collapsed stock price ($0.51-$0.65), NYSE non-compliance notice, and fundamental business model disruption from ChatGPT - several factors argue against imminent bankruptcy: (1) The timeframe is very short at just 57 days, (2) Analysts still project positive earnings of $0.01/share for Q1, suggesting ongoing viability, (3) The company is still operating normally and planning earnings releases, (4) NYSE non-compliance gives 6 months to cure (beyond July 1), not immediate delisting, (5) No reports of debt defaults, covenant violations, or liquidity crises. Low stock prices alone don't cause bankruptcy - it's about cash flow and debt service capacity. The probability is not lower because the stock collapse and business disruption are real concerns that could reveal deeper problems in the May 12 earnings. It's not higher because there's no specific evidence of imminent insolvency, and even severely distressed companies often operate for months or years before bankruptcy. I would update higher with news of: debt defaults, credit downgrades to distressed levels, inability to access capital, or revelation of hidden liabilities. I would update lower with: successful capital raise, positive Q1 results, or signs of business stabilization.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chegg file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWall Street Journal: [How ChatGPT Brought Down an Online Education Giant](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-chatgpt-brought-down-an-online-education-giant-200b4ff2)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Chegg, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nChegg Inc. received a non-compliance notice from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) because its stock price fell below the minimum average closing price of $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, trading around $0.51-$0.65 as of early May 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
