    "review": "Both forecasters provide thoughtful analyses that align closely with my initial reasoning. Forecaster 3's explicit two-component breakdown (fight occurring × Dvalishvili winning conditional on it happening) is particularly valuable and validates my approach. Forecaster 2's 'burden of proof' framing is compelling - O'Malley needs to demonstrate fundamental evolution in less than a year after a decisive loss. The tight range (63-72%) suggests we're converging on similar assessments of the key factors.\n\nForecaster 3's lower forecast (63%) appears to weight cancellation risk and O'Malley's improvement potential somewhat higher. However, with only 12 days remaining, the probability of fight cancellation is declining - most late withdrawals would have occurred by now, and Dvalishvili has explicitly stated his intention to compete despite minor injuries. Forecaster 2's higher forecast (72%) strongly emphasizes the concrete evidence favoring Dvalishvili versus the speculative nature of O'Malley's improvements.\n\nNew considerations raised include: judging variance/draw possibilities (small but non-zero), betting market movements as updating signals, and the explicit separation of cancellation risk from win probability. The most persuasive new argument is Forecaster 2's point that the evidence base for Dvalishvili is concrete (dominant first fight, 12-fight streak, successful title defense) while O'Malley's case relies more on speculation about post-surgery improvements.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, I'm making a modest upward adjustment from 68% to 70%. The key factors driving this update are: (1) Forecaster 2's 'burden of proof' argument is convincing - O'Malley must show he's fundamentally evolved from a fighter who lost decisively nine months ago, which is a high bar. (2) With 12 days remaining until the event, cancellation risk is declining and likely lower than I initially weighted. Most serious injuries that would cause withdrawal would typically manifest by now. (3) The concrete evidence strongly favors Dvalishvili: decisive first victory, extended winning streak, successful title defense against elite competition.\n\nHowever, I'm not moving all the way to 72% because: (1) O'Malley's post-hip surgery improvements and elite training partners (Adesanya) are not purely speculative - surgery can legitimately improve athletic performance. (2) MMA has inherent unpredictability, especially with O'Malley's knockout power. (3) Small but real risks of draw/NC/judging variance exist. (4) The injuries to Dvalishvili's finger and toe, while 'minor,' still introduce some uncertainty.\n\nMy updated forecast of 70% reflects high confidence in Dvalishvili based on concrete recent performance, while preserving meaningful uncertainty around cancellation risk, O'Malley's improvements, and fight-night variance.",
