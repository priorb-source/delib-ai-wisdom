  "information": "In early March 2025, during the inauguration of President Yamandú Orsi in Montevideo, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva publicly invited Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico to the BRICS summit scheduled for July in Rio de Janeiro. Lula stated, 'it's essential that these countries participate, because it's a moment for debate with the whole world.' Following the invitation, President Orsi expressed interest in participating, stating he hoped other Latin American countries would join to 'consolidate multilateralism and free trade.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no formal announcement of acceptance has been made yet",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Uruguay continues internal deliberations about the geopolitical implications of attending BRICS, faces domestic opposition to closer alignment with the bloc, or simply runs out of time without making a formal public announcement before the July 1 deadline, even if internal discussions favor attendance",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In the next 3-4 weeks, Uruguay's government concludes its internal review and issues a formal statement through its foreign ministry or presidential office confirming that President Orsi will attend the Rio de Janeiro BRICS summit in July 2025",
    "rationale": "The key consideration is that three full months have elapsed since Lula extended the invitation in early March 2025, yet no formal announcement has been made. This extended delay is a strong negative signal. While President Orsi expressed interest and stated he hoped other Latin American countries would participate to 'consolidate multilateralism and free trade,' expressing interest is fundamentally different from formally accepting an invitation. The delay suggests significant internal deliberation, likely about the geopolitical implications of Uruguay participating in BRICS, which includes China and Russia and represents a potential shift from Uruguay's traditionally Western-aligned foreign policy. The positive factors include: (1) Orsi's expressed interest, (2) 26 days remaining is technically sufficient time for an announcement, and (3) Brazil's strong push for regional participation. However, the status quo heavily favors No. If Uruguay genuinely intended to participate, standard diplomatic protocol would typically involve confirming attendance weeks or months in advance of a major summit, not days before the resolution deadline. The fact that participation was still 'up in the air' in early March and no announcement has materialized by early June suggests either internal political constraints or strategic ambivalence. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of: imminent cabinet meetings specifically on BRICS attendance, statements from foreign ministry officials suggesting a decision is forthcoming, or signals from other invited countries (Colombia, Mexico) making similar commitments that could create momentum. For it to move lower, any statement from Uruguayan officials expressing doubt, scheduling conflicts, or domestic political opposition would be decisive. My probability reflects that while there's still time for an announcement, the three-month delay without action makes the status quo (No) the most likely outcome.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn early March 2025, during the inauguration of President Yamandú Orsi in Montevideo, Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva publicly invited Uruguay, Colombia, and Mexico to the BRICS summit scheduled for July in Rio de Janeiro. Lula stated, 'it's essential that these countries participate, because it's a moment for debate with the whole world.' Following the invitation, President Orsi expressed interest in participating, stating he hoped other Latin American countries would join to 'consolidate multilateralism and free trade.'\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
