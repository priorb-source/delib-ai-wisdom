  "information": "In response to the dissolution decree, Malian political parties have initiated legal challenges, filing lawsuits in six courts in Bamako and a separate appeal to the administrative section of the Supreme Court. They argue the decree infringes on their rights to association, assembly, and participation in public life. On May 3, 2025, prior to the decree, hundreds of people attended a protest in Bamako organized by the parties. Following the decree, Malian intellectuals, including writers and lawyers, signed a statement denouncing the regime's actions. Reports indicate at least three opposition members have been arrested.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No reversal; the dissolution remains in force and parties remain banned",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Courts slow-walk or dismiss challenges; the junta maintains the decree amid limited, repressed protests; external pressure remains weak and no major concession is offered before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing growing domestic pushback and/or a credible legal threat, the junta announces a rescission of the May 13 decree and broadly reauthorizes political parties to exist and form again (not just a narrow, regime-friendly carveout).",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: Mali’s junta has steadily consolidated authoritarian control (suspending political activity in 2024 and now dissolving all parties). Such crackdowns are rarely reversed quickly, especially within a tight 6-week window. The government has limited tolerance for opposition and has arrested critics.\n- Institutions and legal path: The research assistant notes lawsuits in six Bamako courts and an appeal to the administrative section of the Supreme Court. However, Mali’s judiciary is unlikely to act independently against the junta in the near term. Even if a court issued an adverse ruling, enforcement would hinge on the executive’s willingness to comply. The timeline before July 1 is short for a full judicial process culminating in an enforceable reversal.\n- External pressure: Mali has distanced itself from ECOWAS and relies less on Western partners, reducing leverage from sanctions or aid conditionality in the short run. AU and UN criticism may continue but likely won’t force a reversal within weeks. Russia-aligned support further insulates the regime.\n- Domestic pressure: There were protests (hundreds on May 3) and statements from intellectuals and lawyers after the decree. While this shows resistance, the scale appears modest and the regime has shown readiness to repress. Rapid mass mobilization sufficient to force a U-turn in 40 days seems unlikely.\n- Definition nuance: The market requires a general reauthorization of parties, not a cosmetic partial reinstatement. The junta could attempt controlled political openings, but a broad, clear reversal in this timeframe is a high bar.\nWhy not higher: Short timeline, entrenched authoritarian trajectory, weak external leverage, and low likelihood of swift court action.\nWhy not lower: Some probability remains that the junta calculates a tactical retreat to ease domestic/legal pressure or international criticism, or that a court ruling creates a face-saving off-ramp before July 1.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of the Supreme Court or key administrative court preparing to strike down the decree; large, sustained protests with elite defections; significant aid/sanctions threat tied explicitly to reinstating parties.\nWhat would move me down: New arrests of opposition leaders, further decrees tightening control, or credible reporting that courts have dismissed challenges or are indefinitely delaying them.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Mali reverse its decision to dissolve all political parties?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mali's Military Government Shuts Down All Political Parties](https://www.legit.ng/world/africa/1654992-malis-military-government-shuts-political-parties/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the government of Mali announces a reversal of its May 13, 2025 presidential decree dissolving all political parties in the country.\n\nA partial reversal, such as allowing the reinstatement of a limited number of parties, will only count as long as new parties are generally allowed to be formed again.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn response to the dissolution decree, Malian political parties have initiated legal challenges, filing lawsuits in six courts in Bamako and a separate appeal to the administrative section of the Supreme Court. They argue the decree infringes on their rights to association, assembly, and participation in public life. On May 3, 2025, prior to the decree, hundreds of people attended a protest in Bamako organized by the parties. Following the decree, Malian intellectuals, including writers and lawyers, signed a statement denouncing the regime's actions. Reports indicate at least three opposition members have been arrested.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
