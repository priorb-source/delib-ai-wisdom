    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the key factors driving this question: the promising initial report of negotiations versus the powerfully negative signal of the subsequent two-year silence and the very tight two-month deadline. Forecaster 2 makes a compelling point that the specificity of the initial leak (20 units, $300 million) suggests talks were highly advanced, not merely exploratory. This is a point I had perhaps under-weighted, as it makes a sudden announcement of a nearly-completed deal more plausible. Forecaster 3 provides an excellent, structured analysis that aligns closely with my own, but adds useful granularity by mentioning the low base rate for such deals closing in a short window, the added friction of 'first-of-a-kind' sales, and specific potential blockers like Chinese pressure or Vietnam opting for a different artillery solution. Overall, their reasoning is highly convincing and reinforces the core logic of my initial forecast while providing additional texture. Forecaster 2's analysis prompts me to slightly increase my probability, while Forecaster 3's analysis anchors me and prevents me from moving too significantly.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am making a slight upward revision to my forecast. My initial forecast of 30% was heavily weighted by the two-year lack of any public follow-up, which remains the strongest piece of evidence for a 'No' outcome. However, I found Forecaster 2's argument that the specific details (20 units, $300M) in the original 2022 report suggest that negotiations were already at a very advanced stage to be persuasive. A deal that is 95% complete can remain dormant for political or budgetary reasons and then be finalized and announced very quickly. The two-month window is short, but not impossibly so for signing off on a nearly-finished agreement. This consideration nudges my probability upwards. Concurrently, Forecaster 3’s points about the low base rate for rumored deals resolving this quickly and the specific hurdles for a 'first-of-a-kind' sale reinforce my conviction that this remains the less likely outcome. Balancing these inputs, I believe a modest increase is warranted to better reflect the possibility that the groundwork has already been laid for a rapid announcement, while still acknowledging that the prolonged silence and tight deadline make 'No' the probable result. I am therefore moving my forecast from 30% to 35%.",
