    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identify the central tension: a very strong status quo of no tests since 2017 versus North Korea's latent capability and unpredictability, all constrained by a short two-month time horizon. Our reasoning is highly aligned. Forecaster 2 reinforces the significance of the current moratorium by contrasting it with the shorter, historical gaps between tests. The most salient new point was raised by Forecaster 3: that multiple 'imminent test' warnings from intelligence sources in 2022-2023 never materialized. I find this point extremely convincing as it suggests that technical readiness at the Punggye-ri site is now the baseline status, not an immediate precursor to a test. This context significantly discounts the weight of ongoing intelligence reports about their preparedness. While I find Forecaster 3's reasoning compelling, their final probability of 12% seems inconsistent with their own arguments, which strongly support the status quo holding. Given the failed prior warnings, the baseline hazard rate appears lower than a 12% forecast over two months would imply, especially with no new triggers.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. The deliberation has reinforced my initial analysis rather than challenging it. The core reasons remain the same: the long-standing moratorium since 2017 represents a stable equilibrium, the two-month window is very short for such a major policy shift, and the diplomatic and economic costs, especially from China, remain formidable deterrents. My confidence in this view is strengthened by Forecaster 3's point about the numerous unfulfilled warnings of an 'imminent' test in recent years. This demonstrates that North Korea's technical preparedness is a political holding pattern, not a reliable indicator of intent to test in the near future. Absent a sudden and dramatic geopolitical trigger—which is always a possibility but not the base case—the regime is unlikely to pull that trigger in the next 60 days. The other forecasters did not present evidence suggesting a change in this calculus. Therefore, my 5% forecast remains an appropriate estimate, capturing the small but non-zero tail risk of a surprise political decision by Pyongyang.",
