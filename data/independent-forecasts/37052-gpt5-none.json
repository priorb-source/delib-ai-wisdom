    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 66 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No successful coup occurs in Africa or Latin America by June 30, 2025. Sahel juntas (Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger) continue to consolidate; instability in Chad and Guinea-Bissau yields arrests or brief mutinies rather than regime change; DRC sees no repeat of the 2024 failed plot; Haiti’s turmoil remains gang-driven rather than a military/elite seizure of the transitional authority.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A factional split produces a swift countercoup in Burkina Faso; or Mahamat Déby is deposed by elements of the Chadian security services; or Guinea-Bissau’s military dissolves civilian authority; or conspirators in the DRC manage to seize key nodes in Kinshasa; or (less likely) a Latin American case such as Haiti’s security apparatus displacing the Transitional Presidential Council and consolidating control.",
    "rationale": "- Time window and base rates: The remaining window is ~2.2 months. Africa experienced a surge in 2020–2023 (roughly 2 successful coups/year: Mali 2020/2021, Guinea 2021, Sudan 2021, Burkina Faso twice 2022, Niger 2023, Gabon 2023). 2024–Apr 2025 has had several attempts (e.g., DRC May 2024, Chad Jan 2025) but no successful coups, suggesting the hazard has cooled somewhat. Using a conservative Africa rate of ~1.5/year over 2.2 months gives ~24% (1 − exp(−1.5×2.2/12)). Latin America’s contribution is small (near-zero successful coups in recent years; Bolivia 2024 was an attempt), adding perhaps 1–2% at most. Overall round to the mid-20s.\n- Status quo weighting: Most months see no coups, and the last ~16 months produced zero successful cases despite multiple attempts. Existing juntas have tightened control, which raises the bar for a successful overthrow within a short window. Hence the status quo favors “No.”\n- Hotspots to watch: Burkina Faso (rumored intra-junta tensions and prior alleged plots), Chad (post-election consolidation with a recent attempted attack in Jan 2025), Guinea-Bissau (historically coup-prone), DRC (recent attempt shows active conspirators). Haiti is volatile but more in the realm of gang insurrection than a classic coup; a qualifying event would require state security forces or elites to oust the transitional authority and consolidate power.\n- Why not higher: No successful coups since Aug 2023; many regimes most at risk are already military-led and have purged rivals; international/regional scrutiny is relatively high; the definition requires consolidation of control and cessation of significant resistance, which is a high bar to clear quickly.\n- Why not lower: Structural conditions in several states remain coup-prone (elite factionalism, economic stress, security challenges). Recent failed plots (DRC 2024, Chad 2025) demonstrate ongoing intent and capability; short-notice coups are hard to anticipate and can unfold rapidly within this timeframe.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of mass arrests for plotting, sudden dismissals of top commanders, unusual troop movements into capitals, breakdowns in civil-military relations, or a sharply contested political transition (e.g., cancellation of promised timelines) in the listed hotspots.\n- What would move me down: Clear signs of elite reconciliation, strengthened presidential guard control without backlash, credible security assistance deployments that deter plotting, or several weeks of quiet in the key capitals without warning indicators.\n- Research assistant input: None provided beyond the prompt; forecast relies on recent public patterns and base-rate reasoning.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to [Powell & Thyne (2011, p. 252)](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf), a coup is \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\" In recent years, some of the coups in Africa have been:&#x20;\n\n* [Mali August 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Mali May 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Niger March 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Nigerien_coup_attempt) (attempt)\n* [Niger July 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nigerien_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Gabon August 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Gabonese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Chad January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%27Djamena_attack) (possible attempt)\n* [Burkina Faso January 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Burkina Faso September 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)&#x20;\n* [Guinea September 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n\nLatin America has had the following coup attempts in recent years:\n\n* [Peru self-coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Peruvian_self-coup_attempt), December 2022\n* [Brazil Congress attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack), January 2023\n* [Bolivia coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bolivian_coup_attempt), June 2024\n\nSee also: [VoA by the numbers Coups in Africa](https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is a successful coup d’état in any country on the African continent or Latin America before July 1, 2025, according to credible media reports. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nLatin America is defined as any country in North America or South America whose primary language is Spanish, Portuguese or French.\n\nA coup d’état (often shortened to \"coup\") is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) as an event in which a state's military or other components of its power structure overthrow the existing political authority.&#x20;\n\nA \"successful\" coup is defined as a coup in which the group or person attempting to seize power establishes control over both the government and military, and will be considered to have succeeded once any significant resistance to their authority has ceased.&#x20;\n\nA self-coup, [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup) as a political leader, having come to power through legal means, remaining in power through illegal means, will count. This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
