  "information": "An executive order signed on March 7, 2025, aims to limit eligibility for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program by altering the definition of 'public service'. The order directs the Department of Education and the Treasury Department to propose regulatory changes to make certain public-sector employees ineligible. Additionally, a provision within the House GOP's 2025 tax bill would grant the U.S. Treasury Secretary the authority to revoke the tax-exempt status of non-profits designated as 'terrorist supporting organizations,' which would disqualify their employees from the PSLF program.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education is establishing a Negotiated Rulemaking Committee, named the Student Loans and Affordability Committee, tasked with developing proposed regulations for federal student aid programs. A key focus of this committee will be to refine the definition of qualifying employers for Public Service Loan Forgiveness eligibility. The deadline for nominations for negotiators was June 1, 2025, and the committee is scheduled to hold its first session from June 30 to July 2, 2025, with proposed and final rules anticipated for release later in 2025.\n\nThe Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is established by federal statute, specifically Section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act (codified at 20 U.S.C. §1087e(m)). Consequently, terminating the program is generally understood to require a new act of Congress. Unilateral executive action to end the program is considered to have uncertain legal standing and would require, at a minimum, a formal notice-of-proposed-rulemaking process, including a public comment period, before any changes could be finalized.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 48 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the tracker remains at “in progress.”",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "PSLF continues to exist in statute; DOE/Treasury pursue rulemaking to narrow eligibility but no repeal or operational shutdown occurs before July 1, and the tracker leaves the item as not complete.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A fast-moving congressional package that repeals or effectively suspends PSLF is signed into law before July 1, or the administration halts PSLF in a way the tracker deems tantamount to termination and marks the objective complete early.",
    "rationale": "Key facts: PSLF is established by statute (20 U.S.C. §1087e(m)). Termination generally requires an act of Congress. The administration’s March 7, 2025 executive order and forthcoming DOE/Treasury rulemaking aim to narrow eligibility, not eliminate the program outright. The negotiated rulemaking committee’s first session runs June 30–July 2, 2025, with proposed/final rules expected later in 2025—too late to amount to a completed termination by July 1. A House GOP tax bill provision affecting some nonprofits would at most reduce eligibility; it does not terminate PSLF on its own and would require enactment. Given these constraints and timing, the most likely outcome is the tracker remains “in progress” by July 1. I put extra weight on status quo persistence: the sheet already shows “in progress,” and legal/process timelines are slow. Why not higher? Because getting to true termination before July 1 would require either an unusually rapid congressional repeal (including clearing Senate hurdles and potential filibuster/Bryd Rule issues) or an aggressive executive suspension that the tracker would accept as “termination,” both of which are unlikely on this timeline. Why not lower? There is a nonzero chance the tracker’s editorial criteria could mark “complete” if the administration effectively guts PSLF’s functionality (e.g., suspends processing/discharges) or if a surprise legislative vehicle with PSLF repeal clears quickly. What would move me up: credible reporting of a live, fast-track legislative vehicle with PSLF repeal that has the votes; DOE/Treasury announcing an immediate halt to PSLF processing and the tracker signaling that would count as completion. What would move me down: explicit tracker guidance that only a statutory repeal counts; signs that rulemaking is slower or narrower than expected; congressional gridlock indications.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
