    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, Ralph Norman is a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and has not formally declared his candidacy for the U.S. Senate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without Ralph Norman making a formal announcement of his candidacy for the US Senate. He may decide against a difficult primary challenge to a well-funded incumbent, or he may simply be timing his announcement for later in the year, after this question resolves.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In the next month, Ralph Norman leverages his platform as a conservative critic of Lindsey Graham to formally launch a primary campaign. He holds a press conference or issues a statement announcing his candidacy, backed by initial fundraising commitments, before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo and the short time remaining until the resolution date. The world generally changes slowly, and launching a primary challenge against a formidable incumbent like Lindsey Graham is a significant undertaking that is not done lightly. While Rep. Norman has been openly critical of Graham and has reportedly considered a run for over a year, the deadline for this question is just one month away. There is currently no public information, such as FEC filings, reports of key staff hires, or credible leaks, to suggest an announcement is imminent in this specific timeframe. The absence of such signals is a strong indicator that a launch is not planned for the immediate future. The path of least resistance is for Norman to continue serving in the House and either forego a run or announce it later in the cycle. My probability is not lower than 15% because a surprise announcement is always possible in politics, and a one-month window is sufficient to execute a planned campaign launch. He may have his preparations in place and is merely waiting for an opportune moment. My probability is not higher because the lack of any recent public maneuvering or chatter makes an announcement in the next 32 days unlikely. I would increase the probability significantly upon seeing credible reports from journalists or FEC filings indicating a launch is imminent. Conversely, I would lower it if Norman made a public statement praising Graham or committing to his House re-election campaign.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ralph Norman declare his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Sen. Lindsey Graham may face right-wing primary challenge in 2026](https://www.axios.com/2023/09/13/lindsey-graham-primary-challenge-ralph-norman)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Will Ralph Norman declares his candidacy for the US Senate race in South Carolina before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
