    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides the most critical new information: the latest weekly claims reading was 247,000, and the 4-week moving average is approximately 235,000. This hard data provides a much stronger anchor than the qualitative trend I initially used. Their reasoning that a drop to 220,000 would require a significant move against this established baseline is very convincing. Forecaster 3 corroborates the general direction of a softening labor market with useful macro indicators (job cuts, hiring data), but their analysis is critically hampered by their stated lack of the current claims level. Had they possessed the data from Forecaster 2, their probability would almost certainly be much higher. Therefore, I find Forecaster 2's analysis to be more grounded and actionable.",
    "rationale": "I am increasing my forecast from 65% to 73%. My initial analysis correctly identified the upward trend in claims, but I underestimated the current level. The specific data points provided by Forecaster 2—a recent peak of 247,000 and a 4-week moving average of ~235,000—establish that the status quo is firmly above the 220,000 threshold. For the outcome to resolve 'No', the claims would need to fall by more than 15,000 from the recent average. While weekly data is volatile and such a drop is possible, it represents a reversal of the current trend, not just random noise. The broader economic context of significant corporate layoff announcements supports the idea that the recent higher claims level is not an anomaly. My updated forecast of 73% reflects this much higher baseline, while still acknowledging the inherent weekly volatility of the series which makes a sub-220k reading a non-trivial possibility.",
