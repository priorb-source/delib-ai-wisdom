    "review": "My peers and I reached a similar conclusion but assigned different weights to the key variables. We all agree that the primary factor supporting a 'Yes' is the status quo; Berkshire's last filing showed 10.7 million shares, providing a buffer that requires an active sale for the outcome to be 'No'. We also all agree that the primary counterargument is Berkshire's consistent, 10-quarter streak of being a net seller of equities, signaling a broad desire to raise cash. Forecaster 2 placed significant weight on this net-selling trend, arguing it was likely a firm-wide strategy that would make trimming the Amazon position plausible, leading to a 70% forecast. Forecaster 3 made an excellent point that I hadn't fully considered: the Amazon stake was likely initiated by Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, not Buffett himself. They may have a higher long-term conviction in this specific growth stock, potentially insulating it from Berkshire's broader de-risking strategy. This nuanced argument effectively moderates the impact of the net-selling trend.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward based on the deliberation. My initial 85% forecast was heavily anchored on the status quo and Amazon's strong fundamentals, and I believe I underweighted the strength and persistence of Berkshire's 10-quarter net selling trend. Forecaster 2's emphasis on this point was convincing; such a long-standing pattern of behavior indicates a powerful strategic priority to raise cash and reduce market exposure. It is highly plausible that this directive led to trimming across many positions, including a modest 6.5%+ reduction in the Amazon stake. However, Forecaster 3's point about this being a Combs/Weschler holding provides a crucial counter-balance. Their investment mandates may differ from Buffett's current macro view, and they may be more reluctant to sell what they consider a core long-term growth holding. This makes it less likely that the Amazon position would be trimmed compared to other holdings in the portfolio. Considering these two points together, I am reducing my confidence from 85%. The probability of a trim that pushes the holding below 10 million shares is higher than I initially estimated. My new forecast of 78% reflects a balance between the powerful firm-wide selling trend and the specific, high-conviction nature of this particular holding.",
