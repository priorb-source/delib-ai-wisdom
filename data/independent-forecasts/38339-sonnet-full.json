  "information": "The 13-year gas transmission agreement between Bulgaria’s state-owned gas company Bulgargaz and Turkey’s BOTAŞ was signed in January 2023. The contract includes a 'take or pay' clause, obligating Bulgargaz to pay approximately $580,000 per day regardless of whether it uses the reserved capacity. Since July 2024, Bulgargaz has ceased payments, accumulating a debt reported to be around 4 billion leva (approximately €2 billion). Bulgarian officials have stated the company does not have the financial capacity to pay this debt, and Bulgargaz reportedly expects to incur a loss of 280 million leva in 2024.\n\nBulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has publicly stated to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that 'Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal.' Former Bulgarian Deputy Energy Minister Zhecho Stankov stated that termination of the contract is blocked until the outstanding debt is fully settled. Despite the public statements, talks between the two countries as of May 2, 2025, focused on price and capacity renegotiation rather than outright cancellation. Turkey has publicly maintained a stance of viewing Bulgaria as a strategic partner and has opposed cancellation.\n\nIn early June 2025, Russian energy company Gazprom abandoned its plan to build a major gas distribution hub in Turkey. Reports cited insufficient pipeline capacity from Turkey to Greece and Bulgaria as a key reason for the project's lack of feasibility. Separately, Bulgaria has pursued other energy initiatives, signing gas exploration and drilling agreements with Shell and NewMed for blocks in the Black Sea. Bulgaria also has reserved 1 billion cubic meters of gas per year from the Alexandroupolis LNG terminal in Greece.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 25 days, from June 6, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No cancellation - the agreement continues to exist despite non-payment and ongoing tensions, with negotiations focused on renegotiation rather than termination",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Bulgaria and Turkey continue their negotiations focused on price and capacity adjustments rather than cancellation. Despite the significant debt and public statements about wanting out, no formal cancellation announcement is made by either party before July 1. The contract remains technically in force even if not being honored financially, as both sides continue dialogue and Turkey maintains its stance opposing cancellation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either Bulgaria or Turkey formally announces cancellation of the agreement within the next 25 days. This could occur if Bulgaria decides the €2 billion debt is truly insurmountable and makes a unilateral termination announcement, or if Turkey decides to formally terminate due to 11 months of non-payment. The financial crisis at Bulgargaz could force Bulgaria's hand, or Turkey could decide to cut losses despite strategic concerns.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly suggests no cancellation will occur before July 1. Despite the severe financial situation - Bulgaria has accumulated €2 billion in debt since stopping payments in July 2024 - the contract has persisted through nearly a year of non-payment. Most tellingly, as recently as May 2025, talks between the countries focused on renegotiation of price and capacity rather than cancellation. Turkey has publicly opposed cancellation and views Bulgaria as a strategic partner. A former Bulgarian Deputy Energy Minister stated that termination is blocked until debt is settled, suggesting a procedural barrier. With only 25 days remaining, there is insufficient time for what would likely be a complex formal cancellation process. While PM Borissov's public statements about needing out of the deal and Bulgaria's pursuit of alternative energy sources (Shell/NewMed Black Sea drilling, Alexandroupolis LNG terminal reservations) demonstrate serious intent to reduce dependence on this agreement, these actions are more consistent with long-term strategic pivoting than imminent cancellation. The recent abandonment of Gazprom's Turkish hub plans might reduce Turkey's regional gas hub ambitions, but this doesn't directly accelerate cancellation of the Bulgaria-Turkey agreement. The strongest factor preventing a higher forecast is the complete absence of any recent reporting about imminent cancellation, combined with the status quo bias that contracts - especially international government agreements - tend to persist even under strain. For the probability to be higher, we would need evidence of formal termination proceedings, breakdown in negotiations, or announcements of imminent action. For it to be lower, we would need confirmation of successful renegotiation progress or explicit statements from both parties about contract continuation through 2025.",
