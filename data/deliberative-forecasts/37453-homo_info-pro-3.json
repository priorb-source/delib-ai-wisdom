    "review": "The other forecasters introduced a crucial piece of information that I had not explicitly considered: the official procedural framework for a referendum in Alberta, which is a citizen-led petition requiring approximately 177,000 verified signatures. Forecaster 2 correctly noted that Premier Smith's own public statements suggest a longer timeline (2026), and Forecaster 3 added the critical status update that this petition has not even been submitted yet. Their reasoning is highly convincing as it adds a concrete, logistical barrier on top of the political and economic hurdles I initially identified. The argument that it is logistically infeasible to launch, complete, and verify such a petition before the July 1 deadline is very strong.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. The new information provided by my colleagues significantly strengthens the case for a 'No' resolution. The procedural requirement of a citizen-led petition, which has not yet been submitted, makes the standard path to a referendum announcement before July 1, 2025, practically impossible. This reinforces my initial assessment. However, my initial 5% probability was not based on the standard process succeeding, but rather on the small chance of an extraordinary 'black swan' event, such as a severe federal-provincial crisis, compelling Premier Smith to take unilateral action and bypass the established procedure. The new information confirms that this extraordinary path is now the *only* plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome. While this might suggest lowering my forecast, 5% already represents a tail-risk probability, and I believe it appropriately captures the known political volatility and the Premier's demonstrated willingness to engage in high-stakes political maneuvering. The new evidence solidifies the reasoning for a low probability but does not reduce the chance of the specific tail-risk scenario I had already priced in.",
