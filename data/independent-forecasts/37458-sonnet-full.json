  "information": "The last mutually acknowledged phone call between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping took place on January 17, 2025. Since then, Trump has claimed to have spoken with Xi on multiple occasions, but China's Foreign Ministry has repeatedly and publicly denied that any leader-to-leader calls have occurred. On May 5, 2025, President Trump stated he had 'no immediate plans to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping.' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakum reiterated that 'the two heads of state have not called each other recently' and that no negotiations on tariffs are underway.\n\nThe US and China are engaged in an ongoing trade war. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of up to 145% on most Chinese imports, and China has retaliated with tariffs of up to 125% on US goods. On May 6, 2025, Trump stated that Chinese officials want to negotiate, but on the same day, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Congress that no official negotiations have begun between the two countries. High-level trade talks between Treasury Secretary Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng are scheduled to take place in Geneva on May 10-11, 2025.\n\nIn March 2025, news outlets including The Wall Street Journal reported that the US and China were in the early stages of discussing a potential 'birthday summit' for June, as Trump's birthday is on June 14 and Xi's is on June 15. The status of these discussions is uncertain. In early May 2025, Chinese President Xi Jinping is on a state visit to Russia from May 7 to 10 to meet with President Vladimir Putin and attend Victory Day celebrations. Topics for their discussion include strategic relations and the US tariff war.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known by June 15, 2025, which is 39 days from today (May 7, 2025). The relevant window for resolution is May 12 to June 15, 2025, a 34-day period.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No phone call between Trump and Xi. The status quo is characterized by a lack of mutually acknowledged communication since January 17, 2025, with Trump claiming calls that China has repeatedly denied, and Trump stating on May 5 that he has 'no immediate plans' to speak with Xi.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The trade tensions remain elevated without prompting direct leader-to-leader communication. The Geneva talks on May 10-11 between lower-level officials either fail to make progress or proceed without creating momentum for a presidential call. Any calls that might occur are not mutually acknowledged by both sides, similar to the disputed claims in recent months. Both leaders remain entrenched in their positions, preferring to let subordinates handle negotiations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Geneva talks between Treasury Secretary Bessent and Vice Premier He Lifeng on May 10-11 make substantive progress, creating diplomatic momentum that leads both leaders to speak directly. Alternatively, the reported discussions about a potential 'birthday summit' in mid-June advance significantly, requiring a preparatory phone call. The severe economic impact of the trade war (145% and 125% tariffs) forces both sides to initiate direct communication to prevent further escalation.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly suggests no call will occur. Key evidence: (1) Nearly 4 months have passed since the last mutually acknowledged call on January 17, 2025. (2) Trump explicitly stated on May 5 he has 'no immediate plans' to speak with Xi - just 2 days ago. (3) China has consistently and publicly denied Trump's recent claims of phone calls, indicating either no calls are happening or a complete breakdown in diplomatic coordination. (4) Treasury Secretary Bessent confirmed on May 6 that no official negotiations have begun.\n\nHowever, several factors provide some possibility for change: The trade war has reached crisis levels with unprecedented tariffs, which could motivate direct communication. High-level talks in Geneva on May 10-11 happen just before the resolution window opens and could create momentum. Reports of 'birthday summit' discussions suggest some diplomatic channels remain open, though their status is uncertain.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: the recent pattern of denied communications suggests deep diplomatic dysfunction, Trump's recent statement indicates no imminent plans, and the status quo of non-communication has persisted for months despite escalating tensions. The world changes slowly, and diplomatic rapprochement typically requires careful groundwork that isn't evident.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: 34 days is sufficient time for circumstances to change, especially if the Geneva talks succeed. The severity of the trade war creates genuine incentive for leader communication. The birthday summit reports, while uncertain, indicate some diplomatic exploration is occurring.\n\nI would update higher if: the Geneva talks produce a joint statement indicating progress, either side signals openness to a leader call, or concrete summit planning becomes public. I would update lower if: the Geneva talks fail or are cancelled, rhetoric escalates further, or either side explicitly rules out near-term leader communication.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Xi Jinping speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCBS News: [Trump says he's talked with Xi about tariffs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
