    "review": "The other two forecasters and I have reached a strong consensus. We all arrived at the same 95% probability, driven by the same core evidence and reasoning. The primary driver for all of us is the set of news reports from early May 2025 stating that Berkshire Hathaway increased its stake in Domino's to 7%. We all agree that this report, combined with the established trend of accumulating the stock in the previous two quarters, makes a 'Yes' outcome highly likely. We also all appropriately identified the same key area of uncertainty: the small chance that the news reports are inaccurate or that the purchases occurred after the March 31, 2025, cutoff. Forecaster 3 made an excellent point that I had not explicitly articulated: the threshold for resolution is very low, requiring the purchase of only a single net share. This insight reinforces the strength of our high-confidence forecast.",
    "rationale": "My initial analysis, which led to a 95% forecast, is strongly validated by the analyses of the other two forecasters. We are in complete agreement on the pivotal importance of the news reports claiming Berkshire increased its stake to 7%. Such a stake would comfortably exceed the 2,382,000 share threshold for a 'Yes' resolution. This evidence is bolstered by Berkshire's clear pattern of buying Domino's shares in Q3 and Q4 of 2024.\n\nForecaster 3's point that the resolution threshold is extremely low—any net purchase at all triggers a 'Yes'—strengthens my conviction in the existing forecast. It means the news reports do not need to be precisely accurate about the 7% figure; they only need to be directionally correct that *some* buying occurred during Q1. This makes the case for 'Yes' even more robust.\n\nHowever, this new insight does not compel me to raise my forecast above 95%. The 5% uncertainty I allocated was to account for the possibility that the news reports were entirely incorrect (i.e., Berkshire actually held steady or sold) or that any reported purchases occurred after the March 31st deadline. This small but real risk of relying on non-official media reports remains. The consensus and the additional logical point from Forecaster 3 solidify my confidence that 95% is the correct probability, as it reflects the overwhelming weight of the evidence while still accounting for a sliver of uncertainty.",
