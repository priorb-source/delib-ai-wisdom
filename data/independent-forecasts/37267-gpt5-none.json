    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Ethiopia remains at Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) with region-specific Level 4 areas, but no nationwide Level 4 upgrade.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security conditions remain mixed but relatively stable: localized conflict and crime persist in Amhara/Oromia and border regions, while Addis Ababa and major corridors remain open; the U.S. Embassy stays fully operational without an Ordered Departure; State’s country-wide advisory stays at Level 3 with detailed regional restrictions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp deterioration triggers a nationwide upgrade: e.g., major escalation of fighting or a new state of emergency affecting multiple regions, a significant terror attack in Addis Ababa, airport disruptions or closures, communications blackouts, or a U.S. Embassy Ordered/Authorized Departure that prompts State to move Ethiopia to Level 4 – Do Not Travel.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon is short. In roughly two months, the U.S. State Department is unlikely to move a country from Level 3 to Level 4 absent a notable, acute shock. Historically, Ethiopia has often sat at Level 3 with “Do Not Travel” restrictions for specific regions during periods of internal conflict.\n- Status quo carries extra weight: the State Department tends to adjust advisories in response to clear, sustained changes in risk. Absent a trigger (e.g., large-scale violence in or near Addis Ababa, regional war spillover, or an Embassy staffing drawdown), the baseline is that the country-level rating remains unchanged over such a short window.\n- The linked media item references “new travel warnings,” but it is not an official State source, and such articles often reflect incremental updates or highlight existing regional cautions rather than a nationwide Level 4 shift.\n- Why not higher: The bar for a nationwide Level 4 is high. Ethiopia’s recent pattern has been Level 3 with specific Level 4 areas; upgrading the entire country generally requires either widespread conflict, systemic mobility/assistance constraints, or direct, severe threats to foreigners nationwide.\n- Why not lower: Ethiopia’s internal security environment remains volatile in several regions, and geopolitical frictions (e.g., with neighbors) create tail risks. A major incident—terror attack in the capital, renewed large-scale clashes, or Embassy drawdown—could prompt a rapid upgrade.\n- Upward update triggers: credible reports of a national state of emergency; significant escalation in Amhara/Oromia or spread of conflict toward Addis; large terrorist incident; international airport disruption; U.S. Embassy Authorized/Ordered Departure or suspension of services; explicit State Department security alerts indicating dramatically increased risk.\n- Downward update triggers: de-escalation steps (ceasefires holding), rollback of emergency measures, improved Embassy posture, and fewer security alerts.\n- Research assistant input: no additional information provided; forecast leans on recent patterns of State advisories and the absence (so far) of widely reported acute shocks.\n",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ethiopia receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Is Ethiopia Safe for Travel? Exploring Addis Ababa’s Rich Culture Amid New Travel Warnings in 2025 : What more you need to know](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/is-ethiopia-safe-for-travel-exploring-addis-ababas-rich-culture-amid-new-travel-warnings-in-2025-what-more-you-need-to-know/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Ethiopia has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Ethiopia.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025,\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
