    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — no new posts appear on the News page during May 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic publishes at least one item on its News page in May, e.g., a Q1 2025 results press release that is cross-posted to the News page, a program milestone/update on the Delta-class spacecraft, a leadership or partnership announcement, or any corporate update timed for May.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The company remains in a quiet period with no flight activity or major milestones to share, investor relations press releases are not mirrored to the News page, and May passes without any editorial updates or announcements posted there.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and base rate: As of Apr 19, 2025, the latest News posts were Jan 30, 2025 and Dec 12, 2024. There were no News posts in Feb–Apr, suggesting a low recent posting cadence. Treating this as the status quo implies a higher-than-even chance of no May update.\n- IR vs. News page: Public companies typically post Q1 results in early–mid May. However, the absence of a News-page item around the likely Q4/full-year results timeframe (Feb) suggests that investor relations releases may not be consistently mirrored on this News page. That reduces the weight of “earnings will force a May News post.”\n- Catalysts that could break the quiet: Major program milestones, leadership changes, partnerships, or a strategic update could trigger a May News post, but with flights paused and limited recent comms, those seem less likely than continued quiet.\n- Status quo weighting: Good forecasting emphasizes inertia; the recent pattern is sparse posting. I therefore lean toward “no post in May.”\n- Why not higher: Companies often cluster news around earnings or corporate events; even if IR and News are separate, they sometimes cross-post significant updates. Any single post would flip this to No, so the upside tail risk is meaningful.\n- Why not lower: The lack of Feb–Apr posts despite likely earnings timing indicates this News page is not used for routine IR items, and overall cadence appears low. Without a known May milestone, the base case is silence.\n- What would move me up: Confirmation of a communications pause, lack of scheduled May events, or evidence that earnings will only appear on the IR site and not the News page.\n- What would move me down: An announced May press release or event likely to be cross-posted to the News page, social media teasers of an impending May update, or a scheduled program milestone in May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
