    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully foregrounds historical precedent: even at peak tensions in 1995–96, the U.S. avoided the word “blockade.” That’s a salient constraint given the resolution hinges on explicit U.S. accusation language, not merely PRC behavior. They also stress the short 56-day window and the need for both PRC action and U.S. rhetorical escalation—three hurdles I agree are jointly unlikely. Forecaster 3 emphasizes the extreme costs and risks to Beijing of a real blockade and thus low base rates, which is directionally right, though the question is about U.S. accusation, not strictly about PRC intent. Still, their point reinforces that PRC tends to prefer gray-zone pressure and drills over crossing a legal threshold that would invite sanctions and potential kinetic responses. New to my thinking is the strong weight on U.S. rhetorical restraint as a binding constraint, anchored by historical precedent; that makes a Yes outcome require unusually clear and sustained port denial. I’m less persuaded by the very low 4% given the May 20 inauguration window and recent pattern of encirclement drills, which modestly elevate tail risk. Overall, the precedent-based argument for Executive-branch caution nudges me slightly down from my prior estimate.",
    "rationale": "The event requires an official U.S. government (Executive branch) public accusation that the PRC is blockading at least one Taiwanese seaport. That’s a high bar both operationally (PRC must materially impede port access) and rhetorically (the U.S. must choose the legally loaded term “blockade”). Recent PLA exercises rehearsing blockade operations and the May 20 inauguration create a near-term window for sharper coercion—e.g., declared “traffic control” or “inspection” zones near port approaches. However, past crises (1995–96; 2022 and 2024 post-election drills) show Beijing often stops short of sustained port denial, and the U.S. carefully avoids “blockade” language absent unmistakable facts. Active diplomatic channels further bias toward calibrated phrasing like “coercive” or “dangerous” rather than “blockade.” Given only ~8 weeks left, a Yes requires: (1) PRC actions that de facto close or consistently turn back traffic to a named port, and (2) the State Dept/DoD/White House explicitly labeling it a blockade. That joint condition remains unlikely. I’m trimming my forecast to reflect the persuasive precedent on U.S. rhetorical caution while keeping a small tail for an inauguration-triggered escalation that forces clearer language.",
