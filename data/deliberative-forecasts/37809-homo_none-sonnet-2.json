    "review": "All three forecasters share similar foundational reasoning: Ted Williams' 1941 achievement represents the last .400 season finish, early-season .400 averages occur with small samples but regress substantially, and July 1 represents a middle ground between small-sample flukes and full-season achievement. Forecaster 2 (25%) emphasizes the 'non-trivial' probability given multiple potential candidates across 30 teams, which is a strong point I underweighted. Forecaster 3 (10%) is most conservative but somewhat contradicts themselves by acknowledging mid-season .400 averages have 'occurred more recently' than season finishes while still forecasting only 10%. The key insight from Forecaster 2 that I hadn't fully incorporated: with ~750 MLB players, multiple candidates increase the probability beyond what a single-player analysis would suggest. However, Forecaster 2's 25% seems too optimistic given the powerful regression forces at work over 300+ at-bats. Forecaster 3's 10% appears too pessimistic for a timepoint that's pre-All-Star break and only 6 weeks away.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should weight the 'multiple candidates' factor more heavily than in my initial analysis. With 30 teams and elite hitters, having several possible players who could maintain .400 increases the overall probability. However, the regression to the mean argument remains extremely powerful - by July 1, players will have substantial samples (300-350 at-bats) where true talent emerges. No one has data on current standings, which is crucial uncertainty. The 6-week timeframe from late May to July 1 is relatively short, limiting regression opportunity, but also means any current .400 hitter would need sustained excellence. Historical base rates suggest maintaining .400 through early July is rare but not unprecedented in the modern era. Balancing these factors, I'm adjusting slightly upward from my initial 15% to account for the multiple-candidates argument, but not to Forecaster 2's optimistic 25%. My updated forecast of 18% reflects: (1) meaningful but not overwhelming probability from multiple elite hitters, (2) strong regression forces over 6 weeks, (3) the relative achievability of July 1 vs. season-end, and (4) our proximity to the target date limiting further regression time.",
