  "information": "Colombia has declared a national health emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, there have been 79 reported cases and 36 deaths since 2024, with the departments of Tolima and Putumayo being the most affected. The government has implemented mobility restrictions in high-risk areas and vaccination requirements for travelers. In response to rising cases in South America, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a level 2 travel notice for the continent, citing spread to newly affected areas in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.\n\nThe Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert in early April 2025 due to an increase in yellow fever cases in the Americas. In the first three months of 2025, 131 human cases and 53 deaths were confirmed in the region, primarily in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This case count is more than double the total for all of 2024. Separately, the United Nations has warned that global aid funding cuts are disrupting child vaccination programs at a level similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to a rise in yellow fever cases after years of decline.\n\nSeveral countries near the outbreak zones have implemented preventive measures. Panama has activated health protocols, although it has not reported a human case since 1974 and has vaccination coverage of over 95% in high-risk areas. Ecuador has also activated protocols and is conducting preventive vaccination campaigns. Costa Rica has made the yellow fever vaccine mandatory for travelers arriving from 43 countries, including many in South America, as of March 11, 2025, due to the presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector in the country.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "38 days (from April 24, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Currently there are no CDC travel health notices for any North American country regarding yellow fever. The outbreak is concentrated in South America.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The yellow fever outbreak remains contained to South America. North American countries including Mexico, Central America (Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, etc.), the United States, and Canada do not develop outbreaks significant enough to warrant a CDC travel health notice by June 1. Preventive measures like vaccination campaigns and mosquito control in countries such as Panama and Costa Rica successfully prevent local transmission.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Yellow fever spreads to one or more North American countries, most likely in Central America (Panama, Costa Rica, or Mexico) where the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector is present. An outbreak emerges with sufficient cases to prompt the CDC to issue a travel health notice for that country by June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a NO outcome. The current outbreak is entirely in South America (Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Bolivia), not North America. While cases have surged dramatically in 2025 (131 cases vs 66 total in 2024), all confirmed cases remain in South American nations. North American countries are geographically defined as including the US, Canada, Mexico, and Central America (Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama). The evidence suggests preparedness rather than active outbreaks: Panama has had no human cases since 1974 and maintains 95%+ vaccination coverage; Costa Rica has mandated vaccines for travelers from affected countries; both have activated health protocols. For a YES outcome within just 38 days, we would need: (1) local transmission to begin in a North American country, (2) cases to accumulate to a level warranting a CDC travel advisory, and (3) the CDC to formally issue such an advisory. While the Aedes aegypti mosquito is present in Central America and global vaccination programs are disrupted, the short timeframe, preventive measures being taken, Panama's excellent track record, and the rarity of yellow fever in Central America all argue against this. The CDC issues travel health notices for sustained risk to travelers, not isolated cases. My forecast is not higher because the base rate of yellow fever outbreaks in North America is extremely low, preventive measures are in place, and 38 days is a short window. My forecast is not lower (not closer to 1-2%) because the outbreak severity in South America is unprecedented for recent years, the mosquito vector is present in the region, and geographic proximity creates some transmission risk. I would update higher if cases were reported in Mexico or Central America, or if there were intelligence about vector control failures. I would update lower if the South American outbreak showed clear signs of containment.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
