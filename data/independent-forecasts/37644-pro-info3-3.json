  "information": "The typical process for an initial public offering of this size involves preparatory steps that have not been publicly observed for Anthropic. There have been no reports or leaks to major financial news outlets like Reuters, the Wall Street Journal, or Bloomberg about the company hiring investment banks or filing a confidential S-1 form. Among U.S. venture-backed companies valued at over $10 billion (decacorns), the base rate for going public is approximately one to two companies per year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Anthropic remains a private company and does not announce an IPO. The outcome is 'No'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes and Anthropic has not filed an S-1 or posted an announcement on its official news site. The company continues to operate privately, focusing on AI development and potentially future private funding rounds.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a surprise move, Anthropic either files a public S-1 form with the SEC or publishes a press release on its website explicitly stating its plan to pursue an initial public offering before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is very low, primarily due to the short timeframe and a complete lack of the typical precursors to a major IPO. With only about six weeks until the deadline, the absence of public signals is compelling evidence against an impending announcement. As my research assistant noted, there have been no reports from major financial news outlets about Anthropic hiring investment banks or confidentially filing an S-1, which are standard preparatory steps that often leak. Furthermore, the base rate for venture-backed decacorns going public is low, making an IPO for any single company in a given year, let alone within a specific six-week window, an unlikely event. The current capital environment for top AI firms is strong in private markets, reducing the immediate need for a public offering. My probability is not lower than 2% to account for the small but non-zero chance of a highly secretive preparation process and a sudden strategic decision to announce. An IPO could offer a significant liquidity event for early investors and employees. I would significantly raise my forecast if credible news of Anthropic hiring underwriters or filing a confidential S-1 were to emerge. Conversely, as each day passes without news, my confidence in a 'No' outcome will increase.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Anthropic announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nIn its most recent funding talks, Anthropic [floated](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-has-floated-40-billion-valuation-in-early-talks-about-new-funding) a valuation of $40 billion. Although there has been speculation that the company could IPO, nothing concrete has been announced yet.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Anthropic, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [News](https://www.anthropic.com/news) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe typical process for an initial public offering of this size involves preparatory steps that have not been publicly observed for Anthropic. There have been no reports or leaks to major financial news outlets like Reuters, the Wall Street Journal, or Bloomberg about the company hiring investment banks or filing a confidential S-1 form. Among U.S. venture-backed companies valued at over $10 billion (decacorns), the base rate for going public is approximately one to two companies per year.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
