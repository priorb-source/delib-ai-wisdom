    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds two useful points: (1) the low bar (>2 in a month) against a recently high operational tempo, and (2) the disclosure-timing risk if the White House batches announcements. Their argument about an institutionalized pipeline (new pardon attorney/WH czar) strengthens the expectation of continued activity. However, the cited “~1,600 clemencies” and a “July convention” are not independently verified here and the latter seems off for 2025, so I discount those specifics while keeping the broader cadence point. Forecaster 3 rightly highlights two downside risks I hadn’t weighted enough: (a) the possibility of exactly two Whitmer-plot clemencies materializing soon, which would miss the threshold, and (b) Trump’s preference for symbolic dates like July 4 that could shift a batch out of June. I find F3’s reliance on first-term June seasonality weak given the very different second-term posture and the fresh May spree, but the “exactly two” and July-4-batching scenarios are concrete No paths that deserve weight.",
    "rationale": "I continue to think Yes is more likely than not: a late-May clemency burst shows both willingness and capacity; the bar is very low; and there are plausible June hooks (June 14 birthday, Juneteenth, late-June SCOTUS news cycle). That said, I’m trimming slightly to reflect the two main risks raised in deliberation: (1) month-to-month lumpiness and a potential strategic pause after May in favor of a July 4 package, and (2) the specific risk that the next tranche centers on exactly two Whitmer-plot grants with nothing else in June. The disclosure requirement also adds a small timing risk if grants slip into July announcements. Net effect: modest downgrade but still clearly above even odds.",
