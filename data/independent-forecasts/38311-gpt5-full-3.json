  "information": "The White House has officially confirmed that President Donald Trump will attend the G7 summit in Canada from June 15-17, 2025. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that details of the visit would be announced shortly. Numerous media outlets reported the confirmation in late May 2025, and official G7 participant lists dated June 3 include Trump.\n\nThe 51st G7 Summit is scheduled to take place in Kananaskis, Alberta. Security measures are being implemented, including a controlled access zone around summit venues from June 10-18 and temporary airspace restrictions. In advance of the leaders' summit, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell attended preparatory G7 meetings in Banff. Historically, sitting U.S. presidents have attended every in-person G7/G8 summit since its inception in 1975.\n\nAccording to reports from the Nikkei newspaper, the upcoming G7 summit may not produce a traditional final joint statement due to disagreements between the U.S. and other member nations. The summit may instead result in several separate documents on specific topics of cooperation, while excluding more contentious issues like global trade and relations with Russia from the formal agenda to avoid conflict. In preparation for the summit, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House on June 5.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12 days (summit begins June 15, 2025; attendance would be evident on day 1)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — he attends in person as planned",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A last-minute cancellation or no-show due to an acute health issue, a major domestic/international crisis that keeps him in Washington, a significant security threat or transportation disruption, or the summit being postponed/moved outside June or shifted to virtual-only",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump flies to Alberta (likely Calgary), helicopters/drives into the Kananaskis secure zone, appears at the opening session and photo-op with other leaders, and participates in at least some plenaries/bilats in person",
    "rationale": "- Evidence: The White House has publicly confirmed President Trump will attend the June 15–17 G7 in Canada; official participant lists as of June 3 include him. Canada has established security perimeters (June 10–18) and airspace restrictions, indicating finalized on-the-ground planning. Pre-summit G7 meetings in Banff with senior U.S. officials have occurred, and a June 5 Trump–Scholz White House meeting suggests active G7 engagement. Historically, sitting U.S. presidents attend in-person G7/G8 summits; cancellations are rare and tied to extraordinary circumstances (e.g., pandemic). - Status quo weighting: With less than two weeks to go and the logistics and diplomatic choreography in place, the default outcome is attendance. Travel to Canada is short, security is robust, and the host venue (Kananaskis) is designed for secure leader visits. - Why not higher: Small but real tail risks remain — sudden presidential health issues, acute domestic crises (e.g., a fast-moving national emergency), severe security threats, extreme weather or aviation disruptions, or a last-minute format change. Additionally, reported policy disagreements (e.g., potential lack of a joint communique) marginally increase friction, though they typically affect communiques, not attendance. - Why not lower: Multiple official confirmations, published schedules/restrictions, and historical base rates strongly favor attendance. Even contentious G7s (e.g., 2018) saw Trump attend. - What would move the forecast up: Release of a detailed WH travel schedule with wheels-up timing; reports of the presidential advance team on-site in Kananaskis; photographic evidence of arrival in Canada; confirmation of bilateral pull-asides fixed on the G7 sidelines. - What would move it down: Credible reports of illness or injury; an unfolding national security crisis; credible threats affecting the venue; announcements of postponement, relocation, or a pivot to virtual; significant Canadian wildfire/airspace disruptions impairing travel.",
