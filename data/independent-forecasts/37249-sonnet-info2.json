  "information": "On May 1, 2025, local elections are scheduled to take place in England, representing the first major electoral test since the Labour party's landslide victory in the July 2024 general election. Voters will elect over 1,600 councillors and mayors across 23 local authorities. In conjunction with these elections, a UK parliamentary by-election is being held in Runcorn and Helsby. Opinion polls for the by-election in early April indicated a lead for Reform UK, with 28% support, putting them 6 points ahead of Labour (22%) and 8 points ahead of the Conservatives (20%). It was also reported that up to 60 council candidates had defected from the Conservative party to run for Reform UK in the May elections.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Exactly 2 months remain (May and June 2025) for Reform UK to achieve #1 polling status with a 4+ point lead in Politico's poll of polls before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Reform UK has not yet achieved #1 in national polling with a 4+ point lead over second place",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK's current momentum from by-election polls and council defections doesn't translate to sustained national polling dominance. Today's local election results are mixed or disappointing, failing to provide the breakthrough needed. Labour and Conservatives maintain sufficient support bases, keeping Reform UK in third or preventing them from achieving the required 4-point lead even if they reach first place.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK performs strongly in today's local elections, winning multiple councils and the Runcorn and Helsby by-election convincingly. This generates significant media coverage and further Conservative defections. The success catalyzes a surge in national polling that pushes Reform UK to 30-35% while Labour or Conservatives drop to 26-28%, creating the required 4+ point gap that persists in Politico's poll aggregation.",
    "rationale": "Reform UK is clearly experiencing significant momentum. The research assistant's report shows they're polling at 28% in a by-election (6 points ahead of Labour), and 60 Conservative councillors have defected to Reform. Today's local elections represent a crucial test that could accelerate or stall this momentum.\n\nHowever, several factors make me cautious about a high probability:\n\n1. **By-election vs national polling gap**: Individual constituency polls don't necessarily reflect national trends. Reform UK may perform well in specific areas without achieving national dominance.\n\n2. **High bar to clear**: The question requires not just reaching #1, but doing so with a 4+ point lead. This is a substantial margin in a multi-party system.\n\n3. **Polling aggregation lag**: Politico's poll of polls is an average, meaning Reform UK would need sustained performance across multiple polls, not just a single outlier.\n\n4. **Historical context**: The UK has strong institutional parties. While Brexit Party/Reform UK has periodically surged in European Parliament elections, translating this to sustained Westminster polling dominance is unprecedented.\n\n5. **Time constraint**: Two months is enough time for momentum to build, but also enough time for it to dissipate.\n\nWhat would make me update higher (to 45-50%): If today's local election results show Reform UK winning multiple councils and the by-election by large margins, with immediate polling showing them at 30%+ nationally.\n\nWhat would make me update lower (to 10-15%): If today's results are disappointing or if initial post-election polls show Reform UK still trailing both Labour and Conservatives.\n\nThe status quo in UK politics remains two-party dominance with Reform as a disruptive third party. While the current trajectory is upward for Reform UK, achieving and sustaining a 4+ point national polling lead within two months requires both excellent election results today and sustained momentum - possible but not probable.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
