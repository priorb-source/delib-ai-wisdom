    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments and our analyses converge significantly on the key factors: extremely low base rates for arrests of former FBI directors, high legal bar for First Amendment-protected speech, compressed timeline, and political sensitivity. Forecaster 3 raises the most important new consideration I hadn't emphasized: the 14-day gap since the May 16 article without any arrest is informative evidence. If the Secret Service truly viewed this as a credible threat requiring immediate action, they typically move quickly on presidential threats. The lack of action over two weeks suggests the investigation is either finding insufficient grounds or proceeding at a pace inconsistent with imminent arrest. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the 'true threat' legal standard and the difficulty of prosecuting symbolic expression (seashells vs. explicit language) reinforces the high legal bar. All three forecasts cluster tightly (2-4%), indicating strong consensus on the low-probability nature of this event.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the temporal decay argument is particularly persuasive. When the Secret Service investigates potential presidential threats, time matters significantly. The 14-day elapsed period without action suggests this is not being treated as an imminent threat requiring arrest. This reduces my probability somewhat. However, I remain slightly above the lowest forecast because: (1) 32 days is still meaningful time for unexpected developments, (2) the investigation remains active as far as we know, (3) the broad arrest definition (any reason, anywhere) creates some tail risk, and (4) while unlikely, politically charged environments can produce surprising outcomes. The convergence of our forecasts at 2-4% gives me confidence we're accurately assessing this low-probability event. I'm updating down from 4% to 3% based primarily on the temporal decay evidence.",
