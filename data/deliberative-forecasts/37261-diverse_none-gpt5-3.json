    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a useful and underweighted point in my initial take: the end-of-June Supreme Court window is a predictable, recurring catalyst for potential mass mobilization. That said, treating it as a Dobbs-like trigger overstates the base rate—few terms generate 10k+ street protests, and Dobbs was an outlier. Forecaster 2 also doesn’t engage with the Global Protest Tracker’s selectivity and tendency to code broad movements rather than single-day protests, which raises the bar for a “new” U.S. entry with a fresh start date. \n\nForecaster 3 correctly highlights the Tracker’s coverage constraint and the need for a catalyzing event, but I still think 45% is high given the two-month window and the requirement that Carnegie create a new U.S. entry with a start date in that window. Their base-rate framing is closer to mine but seems to discount the Tracker’s conservatism.\n\nNet: I give some weight to the SCOTUS timing argument (increases odds versus a random two-month period), but keep a meaningful discount for Tracker selectivity and the need for a distinct, new wave to be recorded.",
    "rationale": "Key constraints remain: (1) The event must be large (≥10k), (2) start within the narrow remaining window, and (3) be recognized by the Global Protest Tracker as a distinct U.S. protest entry with that start date. The Tracker often records major waves rather than isolated big marches and is selective about U.S. additions. \n\nBase rate: Since 2017, the U.S. has only a handful of new entries—well under one per year on average—implying ~10–15% over a random two-month span. \n\nAdjustment for timing: Late June raises risk due to SCOTUS term end. Even without naming specific cases, historically some terms produce contentious rulings that can trigger large demonstrations. I’ll roughly double the random-window baseline to reflect that elevated catalyst probability, but I stop short of 40–60% because (a) most terms still don’t produce Dobbs-scale street mobilization, and (b) the Tracker may treat any such protests as part of an existing movement or not add a new U.S. entry at all. \n\nNet effect: Up modestly from my prior 18% to reflect the SCOTUS timing, but still below 1-in-3 given Tracker selectivity and the short runway.",
