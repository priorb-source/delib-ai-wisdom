  "information": "The U.S. Department of State released the results for the Diversity Visa Program (DV-2026) lottery in early May 2025. Applicants can check their status online through the Entrant Status Check page until September 30, 2026. This followed the release of the DV-2025 results on May 3, 2025. The registration period for the DV-2026 lottery ran from October to November 2024. The program awards up to 55,000 permanent residence visas annually. The State Department has emphasized that the official website, dvprogram.state.gov, is the only channel for results.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, the page will be online. The Diversity Visa (DV) program is an ongoing, congressionally mandated program. The State Department's website is the primary vehicle for its administration, and there are no current indicators of its imminent termination or a major website overhaul that would remove this specific page.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would most likely be the result of a technical or administrative issue rather than a policy change. For instance, the State Department could perform a website redesign that changes the URL structure, causing this specific page to return a 404 error without a redirect. A less likely scenario involves a sudden, unexpected executive order suspending the program, leading to the immediate removal of associated web pages.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The State Department continues its normal operations. The DV program proceeds through its annual cycle, and its informational and application pages, including the specific one in question, remain online as part of the standard government digital infrastructure. This represents the continuation of the current state of affairs.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. Large government programs and their associated websites exhibit significant inertia. The research assistant's report confirms the DV program is in an active phase, with results for DV-2026 having been recently released and the status check portal remaining active until September 2026. This indicates the program is fully operational, making the removal of its primary entry information page within the next six weeks extremely unlikely.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 98% because there is a small, non-zero risk of a technical failure. The resolution criteria are tied to a very specific URL. A website migration or content management error could inadvertently take this page down or change its address without implementing a proper redirect. While government IT practices have improved, such errors are not impossible. This technical/administrative risk is greater than the political risk in this short timeframe.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the political and legislative hurdles to terminating the DV program are substantial and cannot realistically be cleared and implemented in six weeks. Past opposition, such as that mentioned in the background materials, has not succeeded in ending the program, demonstrating its resilience. Any new attempt would be highly publicized and face significant opposition, and we see no signs of such a move being imminent.\n\nI would increase my forecast closer to 100% if the State Department were to issue a statement confirming no website changes are planned for the '/us-visas/immigrate/' section before July. I would decrease my forecast if credible reports emerged of a major cyberattack on State Department web infrastructure, an announced website overhaul scheduled before July 1, or renewed, serious legislative or executive action to immediately suspend the program.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US State Department's Diversity Visa page still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | [Donald Trump's 2017 tweet discussing the DV program](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925684982307348480)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Step 1 Submit an Entry page with instructions for registering for the Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) Program is at [this location](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html) when attempted to be accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. Department of State released the results for the Diversity Visa Program (DV-2026) lottery in early May 2025.

The State Department has emphasized that the official website, dvprogram.state.gov, is the only channel for results.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
