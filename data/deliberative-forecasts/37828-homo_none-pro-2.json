    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental analysis of this question. We all identify the very short timeframe (roughly five weeks until the deadline) and the complete absence of any public signals (e.g., media reports, rumors, formal company communications) as the primary drivers for a low probability of an IPO announcement. Both other forecasters' arguments are convincing and align with my own. Forecaster 2 made a particularly salient point that strong private market performance, as Rippling is experiencing, can reduce the urgency to go public, which strengthens the case for a 'No' resolution. The only notable difference between our analyses is the minor calibration between 2% and 5%. This difference reflects subjective judgment on the likelihood of a low-probability surprise event rather than a disagreement on the underlying facts or reasoning.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 2%. Their reasoning reinforces my initial assessment rather than challenging it. The consensus is that the status quo—Rippling remaining a private company for the duration of this question's timeframe—is the overwhelmingly likely outcome. The arguments presented by the other forecasters do not introduce any new evidence or perspectives that would warrant an increase in my forecast. The path to a 'Yes' outcome would almost certainly require a surprise announcement following a confidential filing process, an event that is possible but highly improbable without any preceding leaks or rumors for a company of Rippling's profile. I believe a 2% chance adequately captures the possibility of this outlier event, whereas 5% feels slightly too high given the total vacuum of information. The deliberation has increased my conviction in my initial forecast.",
