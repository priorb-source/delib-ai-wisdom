  "information": "The current administration's Department of Defense leadership has explicitly stated a policy shift away from climate initiatives. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth remarked that the DoD should focus on \"war-fighting\" and that climate programs are \"ripe for cuts.\" In other statements, Hegseth said, \"The Department of Defense is not concerned with climate nonsense; it's about preparing and conducting war.\" The administration has officially ceased to consider climate change a national security issue and revoked a January 2021 executive order on combating the climate crisis.\n\nSpecific actions have been taken to dismantle climate-related military programs. The U.S. Navy officially rescinded its 'Climate Action 2030' plan, a Biden-era initiative to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Navy Secretary John Phelan announced the decision, emphasizing a renewed focus on \"lethality and our warfighters.\" Furthermore, the Department of Defense has removed $377 million in funding for climate change reduction programs. Other initiatives, such as the Air Force's 'Sustainable Aviation Fuel' program and the Army's plan for tactical vehicle electrification, have also been put in doubt or deemed impractical.\n\nThe Department of Defense's official climate resilience portal, climate.mil, has been offline since January 21, 2025. This takedown is part of a broader removal of climate-related content across various federal websites. Historical precedent from the 2017-2021 Trump administration shows that similar websites taken offline, such as pages on the Environmental Protection Agency's site, often remained down for several years. While some Democratic senators have reportedly demanded an explanation for the portal's removal and may hold hearings in June, no binding mandate or official plan to restore the website has been announced.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 42 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the site remains down as it has been since January 21, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "DoD continues its policy of dismantling climate initiatives and leaves climate.mil offline; no restoration occurs despite any hearings, and IsItDownRightNow still reports the site as down when Metaculus checks on/after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under political/PR pressure (e.g., June hearings), DoD stands up a minimal landing page or archive/redirect at climate.mil that returns a normal HTTP response, leading IsItDownRightNow to report it as online when checked on/after July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: The portal has been down since Jan 21 and, as of May 5, IsItDownRightNow reports it down for everyone. With ~6 weeks to go, the status quo strongly points to No.\n- Policy direction: According to the research assistant, current DoD leadership has deprioritized climate initiatives, rescinded major plans (e.g., Navy’s Climate Action 2030), cut funding, and publicly framed climate programs as non-mission. That makes restoration of a climate-branded portal unlikely on short horizons.\n- Precedent: During the prior Trump administration, climate-related federal pages often stayed down for years. This historical pattern supports a low near-term restoration probability.\n- Incentives and logistics: Even if technically easy to put up a placeholder page, doing so would contradict the stated policy direction and may require approvals across DoD’s web governance and security processes—frictions that reduce odds within a six-week window. Also, there is no announced plan to restore the portal.\n- Upside risks for Yes: Upcoming Senate attention in June could nudge DoD to mitigate optics by restoring a minimal page, an archive banner, or a redirect—any of which could register as “online” to IsItDownRightNow. This keeps the probability above near-zero.\n- Why not higher: Strong ideological signals, budget cuts, and recent takedowns point to deliberate suppression, not a transient outage. There’s no binding mandate to restore, and bureaucratic hurdles make quick reversals unlikely.\n- Why not lower: Restoring a simple landing page is cheap and can defuse criticism; the resolution source only requires the site to respond when checked on/after July 1, not to host prior content.\n- What would move me up: A DoD commitment (even to host an archive), reporting that the site has begun responding intermittently, DNS changes suggesting reactivation, or clear outcomes from June hearings indicating restoration.\n- What would move me down: Further public statements doubling down on removals, confirmation that climate.mil is being decommissioned at the DNS/hosting level, or evidence of a broader permanent purge of related .mil web properties.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
