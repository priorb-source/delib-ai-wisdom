    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite having a license, Starlink keeps Chad as “Coming Soon” through June due to unresolved import/type-approval details, spectrum fee/payment mechanics, or lack of distribution/logistics readiness. No official Starlink announcement; the availability map remains unchanged.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "SpaceX finalizes import/type-approval and logistics, flips service live, and posts “Starlink now available in Chad.” The availability map shows at least part of Chad as “Available,” and orders begin (even if shipping is staged).",
    "rationale": "- Baseline status: As of May 15, 2025, the criteria have not been met; the map does not show Chad as Available. With only ~6.5 weeks left, the status quo leans No unless a deliberate activation occurs. Good forecasting practice gives weight to the status quo, as changes typically require specific actions. \n- Regulatory position: Starlink reportedly secured a license in Chad in Nov 2024—this is a strong enabler. In other African markets, the lag from license to live service has often been 6–12 months. July 1, 2025 is ~7.5 months post-license, placing Chad within a plausible activation window but not guaranteed. \n- Capacity/technical readiness: With optical inter-satellite links and substantial new capacity from V2 Mini launches, technical coverage over Central Africa is likely adequate. Thus, the primary bottlenecks are regulatory and operational rather than satellite capacity. \n- Operational constraints: The research assistant notes potential hurdles—finalizing import/type approvals, spectrum fees, payment flows, and local distribution. These have delayed launches elsewhere and could easily push go-live into H2 2025. \n- Base rates vs. short horizon: Starlink has been rapidly lighting up new African markets, sometimes in batches, which keeps a Yes outcome plausible. But the short time window and the fact that Chad is not yet live argue against a high probability. \n- Why not higher? If activation were imminent, we might expect precursors: reseller announcements, government posts about equipment approvals, pricing pages appearing, or a Starlink “coming this month” cue. Absent those signals, pushing above ~40% feels aggressive. \n- Why not lower? The license is already in hand; Starlink has shown a pattern of quick expansions once regulatory and logistics align. A flip to Available can occur with little external lead time. \n- What would move me up: Evidence of type approval/import clearance; local reseller/distribution announcements; Starlink/X post hinting at near-term launch; Chad-specific pricing or order page assets appearing; the map shifting to “Available Soon” with a near-term date. \n- What would move me down: Reports of regulatory disputes or new fees; customs/payment obstacles; political disruptions; or the map still showing unchanged status by mid-to-late June.

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Chad as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[SpaceX’s Starlink Secures License to Operate in Chad](https://spaceinafrica.com/2024/11/12/spacexs-starlink-secures-license-to-operate-in-chad/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Chad listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nStarlink's expansion faces both technical advantages and logistical challenges. The use of optical inter-satellite links reduces the need for local ground stations in every country. However, high demand has led to service pauses and waiting lists in other regions, including some African countries like Nigeria and Kenya. For Chad specifically, potential obstacles include its landlocked geography, limited retail infrastructure, and the need to finalize details such as import rules and spectrum fees.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
