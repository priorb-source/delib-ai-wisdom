  "information": "French President Emmanuel Macron has stated that recognizing a Palestinian state is a \"moral and political obligation\" and has indicated that France may officially grant recognition during the June UN conference, although he has also tied the move to certain conditions. In May 2025, the UK announced it had joined France's initiative for the recognition of a Palestinian state. According to a report by Axios, Malta is also preparing to declare Palestine's independence at the summit on June 20. Five Arab countries—Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia—have announced their active participation in organizing the conference.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, a UN member country does not newly recognize Palestine in an average month, so the default outcome is that this does not happen in June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The UN conference in June is postponed or concludes without any formal recognition announcements. Key countries like France or the UK, despite their statements, decide to delay recognition due to intense diplomatic pressure from allies like the US, or because pre-stated conditions for recognition are deemed not to have been met.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At the planned UN conference in June 2025, France, Malta, the UK, or another UN member state formally announces its recognition of Palestine as a sovereign nation. This follows through on the public commitments and diplomatic initiatives reported in May 2025.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is based on strong, recent evidence of a coordinated diplomatic push for recognition in June 2025. The research indicates that France, with the UK's support, is leading an initiative, and a UN conference in June is the target venue. Specific intelligence from Axios suggests Malta is preparing an announcement for June 20. The public nature of these commitments from major European powers creates significant political momentum and makes a reversal costly. While the status quo is typically 'no change,' this specific, time-bound, and multi-national initiative represents a substantial deviation from that baseline, making the likelihood of at least one country moving forward very high. The probability is not higher because diplomatic initiatives are subject to last-minute changes; pressure from the US or Israel, or a failure to meet President Macron's unspecified 'conditions,' could still cause a delay beyond June. The probability is not lower because the evidence of a coordinated plan involving multiple countries for a specific timeframe is unusually concrete and public. I would increase my forecast if France or the UK formally confirms a date for recognition. I would decrease it if reports emerge of a postponement of the conference or of key countries reconsidering their stated intentions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a UN member country newly recognize Palestine in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[UK joins France's initiative for recognition of Palestinian state](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/05/20/uk-joins-france-s-initiative-for-recognition-of-palestinian-state_6741456_4.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, a UN member country announces that it recognizes Palestine as a sovereign nation. Resolves based on Al Jazeera's [tracking page](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/10/mapping-which-countries-recognise-palestine-in-2025) or other credible sources should the tracking page not be timely updated.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has stated that recognizing a Palestinian state is a \"moral and political obligation\" and has indicated that France may officially grant recognition during the June UN conference, although he has also tied the move to certain conditions.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
