    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds useful leading-indicator context (starts -14.2% m/m, permits -2%, NAHB at 42) that, if anything, argues against a rapid near-term inventory surge. Their main justification for 30%—that 500k is “close” to 550k with three months to build—understates how large a 50k increase is for this stock series and conflicts with their own cooling-signal evidence. Forecaster 3 highlights rising mortgage rates and the possibility of sales slowing, which could boost inventory, and invokes 2022 as an analogue. That’s the strongest pro-Yes argument. However, they seem to overweight the rate move (a modest uptick) and underweight builders’ active inventory management (price cuts, buydowns) and the recent YoY sales resilience. Starts and sentiment softening also suggest builders won’t flood the market. Both forecasts (30% and 55%) look too high given the magnitude needed over two months and the current slope (503k in March).",
    "rationale": "To exceed 550k by May from 503k in March requires roughly +47k over two months—on the order of two consecutive very large monthly gains. While 2022 showed that big step-ups can occur during acute demand air pockets, current evidence is mixed: modestly higher mortgage rates could slow sales, but builders are leaning on incentives and appear cautious (soft starts, soft sentiment). Recent momentum is mild (500k → 503k Feb to Mar). The pipeline effect from lower starts points to slower, not faster, inventory growth as we move into summer, though completions from prior starts can still add supply. The narrow path to Yes likely requires April printing ≥520–525k and another sizable May increase. Absent an April upside surprise or a sharp sales drop alongside rising completions, breaching 550k by May remains unlikely. I’m nudging my prior 2% up to reflect the 2022 precedent for rapid moves and the plausible mechanism (rates slowing sales), but the bar is still high.",
