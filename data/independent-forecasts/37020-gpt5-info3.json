  "information": "Post Malone has recently made high-profile moves into the country music scene. His country album, \"F-1 Trillion,\" has had strong commercial performance. He has engaged in collaborations with established country stars such as Morgan Wallen, Luke Combs, Blake Shelton, and Jelly Roll. His recent performance at the Coachella festival featured a country-focused set and guest appearances from Jelly Roll and Ed Sheeran. However, this performance received a mixed reception from viewers and critics.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 16 days (until May 8, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Post Malone wins at least one ACM award, most plausibly tied to his blockbuster collaboration and/or a collaboration-focused category.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite four nominations, stronger genre-core contenders sweep key categories (e.g., Song/Single go to Zach Bryan/Kacey Musgraves, Lainey Wilson, Jelly Roll, Luke Combs, or Morgan Wallen without Post in other categories), and ACM voters shy away from rewarding a recent pop-to-country crossover, resulting in an 0-for-4 night.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "His massive hit collaboration edges out rivals in at least one of Single, Song, Music Event, or Video; industry goodwill plus commercial dominance make voters comfortable giving him at least one trophy, even if he misses the marquee artist categories.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates and structure: With four nominations, the chance of at least one win is materially above any single-category probability. If each category were roughly 5 nominees (~20–25% base per category) and partly independent, a back-of-envelope gives ~1 − (0.75)^4 ≈ 68%. In reality, outcomes are correlated, and competition is strong, so I don’t push much higher.\n- Current trajectory (status quo): Post Malone’s pivot to country has been commercially successful, with a dominant collaborative hit and a well-performing country album. The Academy often recognizes blockbuster singles and high-profile collaborations; Music Event/Video and Single/Song are the most plausible paths to at least one win.\n- Research assistant input: He has strong commercial momentum, multiple high-profile collaborations (Wallen, Combs, Shelton, Jelly Roll), and high visibility. A mixed reception to a country-leaning Coachella set is unlikely to weigh heavily with ACM voters compared to radio/streaming impact and Nashville collaborations.\n- Why not higher: Competition is fierce this cycle, and ACM voters can favor core-country acts. It’s plausible that Song and Single split to other heavyweights (e.g., Zach Bryan/Kacey Musgraves, Lainey Wilson, Jelly Roll, Luke Combs, Morgan Wallen). If voter sentiment is cautious about fully anointing a recent crossover, a shutout remains live.\n- Why not lower: Four bites at the apple plus one of the year’s biggest country hits materially lift his floor. Even if he misses the marquee artist categories, collaboration-leaning awards provide additional paths.\n- What would move me up: Reports of strong ACM voter support for the collaboration, pre-show wins in ancillary categories (if any are announced early), or industry chatter signaling he’s favored in Single/Song/Music Event.\n- What would move me down: Late-breaking indications that competitors are sweeping, or credible reporting that voter blocs are resistant to rewarding a crossover this year.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
