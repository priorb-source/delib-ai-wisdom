    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize two viable paths to “Yes”: a public S-1 in June or a specific company news/blog post (including an announcement of a confidential submission). I underweighted the latter path in my prior estimate. Their timing arguments about avoiding the July 4 window and clustering S-1s near marketing windows are sound and consistent with my view. I still think a large consumer platform like Discord is more likely to keep filings confidential until closer to a fall roadshow, and that a blog-post announcement is less likely given typical legal/comms practice. But acknowledging that some companies do announce confidential submissions nudges the odds up modestly.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~5.5 weeks. Resolution requires a public S-1 or an explicit IPO-plans post on Discord’s news/blog. The most plausible route is a mid-June S-1 if they want optionality for a summer or early-fall launch; however, many issuers avoid the early-July period and push public filings to late summer. A blog announcement specifically stating an IPO plan or confidential submission could qualify, but I view that as less likely for Discord. Engagement of major banks and credible reporting of a 2025 IPO keep the probability non-trivial. Net: I raise my forecast slightly (from 20% to 25%) to account for the credible blog-announcement path and the possibility of a June S-1, while still weighting the base case that a public filing waits until late summer.",
