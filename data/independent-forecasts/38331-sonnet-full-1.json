  "information": "In May 2025, Pakistan restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban that was first enforced in February 2024. Internet monitoring organization NetBlocks confirmed that access was restored, allowing citizens to use the platform without a VPN. In a separate development, X blocked access to 126 accounts in Turkey in February 2025 following a court order citing the need for 'protection of national security and public order.' The blocked accounts included those of journalists and activists. In April 2025, a court in Ankara issued further access block decisions for several popular Turkish news accounts on the platform.\n\nThe Indian government ordered X to block access to over 8,000 accounts in May 2025, citing a crackdown on 'anti-India content' and violations of local regulations. The blocked accounts included those of several Turkish and Chinese media organizations, as well as independent media outlets and journalists. X stated its disagreement with the orders, noting that 'blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship... and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech,' but indicated it would comply while investigating legal options.\n\nIn early June 2025, the government of Tanzania blocked access to X. The country's information minister stated the ban was due to the platform hosting explicit sexual material, including pornographic and LGBTQ+ content, which he said was 'contrary to the East African state's laws, culture, customs, and traditions.' The move followed a recent change in X's policy to allow 'consensually produced and distributed' adult content. The Legal and Human Rights Centre (LHRC), a local rights group, described the action as part of a 'troubling pattern of digital repression' ahead of scheduled elections in October.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26 days. The question resolves on or after July 1, 2025, and today is June 5, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - All seven countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela) currently appear on Wikipedia's list of countries blocking X, and they will likely remain there.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the seven countries unblocks X before July 1, 2025, or Wikipedia removes one or more countries from the 'currently blocked' list due to factual clarification, editing disputes, or reclassification of the blocking status. For example, if Venezuela were to reverse its block as part of a policy shift or diplomatic gesture, Wikipedia would update accordingly.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "All seven countries maintain their blocks of X through July 1, 2025, and Wikipedia continues to list all of them in the 'current' section. Given these are authoritarian or semi-authoritarian states with established censorship infrastructure and long-standing blocks, the status quo persists for the next 26 days.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report mentions recent X blocking developments in Pakistan, Turkey, India, and Tanzania, but notably NONE of these involve the seven countries specified in the question. This is actually reassuring for a YES outcome - recent blocking activity has occurred elsewhere, but the seven countries in question show no signs of policy changes.\n\nThese seven countries represent some of the world's most restrictive internet environments: China with its Great Firewall, North Korea with virtually no internet access, Iran and Russia with extensive social media blocks (Russia since March 2022), and Myanmar, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela with longstanding censorship regimes. These blocks are typically part of broader governmental control strategies that don't change quickly.\n\nThe 26-day timeframe is extremely short for major policy reversals. Unblocking decisions would require high-level governmental approval and often signal broader policy shifts, which are rare and typically telegraphed in advance. There's no indication of such movements.\n\nHowever, I'm not forecasting higher because: (1) Wikipedia editing introduces some uncertainty - articles can be modified, and there could be disputes about how to categorize blocks; (2) the question requires ALL seven to remain listed, so even one removal triggers a NO; (3) unexpected geopolitical developments, while unlikely, could occur.\n\nI'm not forecasting lower because the status quo strongly favors YES, these regimes are deeply committed to internet control, and 26 days is insufficient time for meaningful policy change without prior signals. The research report showing continued blocking activity elsewhere (Tanzania, India) reinforces that the global trend isn't toward liberalization.\n\nFor me to update higher (toward certainty): verification that all seven countries are definitively listed on the current Wikipedia page with stable consensus. For me to update lower: any news of policy debates, diplomatic initiatives, or Wikipedia edit disputes involving these countries.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn May 2025, Pakistan restored access to X (formerly Twitter) after a 15-month ban that was first enforced in February 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
