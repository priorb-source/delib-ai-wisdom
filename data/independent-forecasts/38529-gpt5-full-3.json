  "information": "A series of polls conducted between March and June 2025 show Andrew Cuomo as the frontrunner in the Democratic primary. A SurveyUSA poll in May showed Cuomo as the first choice for 43% of likely Democratic voters, with Zohran Mamdani at 11%. A Marist poll from early May placed Cuomo at 37% and Mamdani at 18%, and a simulation showed Cuomo surpassing the 50% threshold to win in the fifth round of ranked-choice voting. An Emerson College/PIX11/The Hill poll from late May placed Cuomo at 39% to Mamdani's 23%. Earlier polls from March by Honan Strategy Group and Data for Progress also showed Cuomo leading Mamdani with 41% to 18% and 39% to 15%, respectively.\n\nAndrew Cuomo has secured endorsements from several key groups and individuals. These include Luis Dávila Pernas, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico; Latin music star Marc Anthony; and several Orthodox Jewish communities, including the Bobov Hasidic movement, the Crown Heights community, and the Far Rockaway Jewish Alliance. In contrast, Cuomo's primary opponent, Zohran Mamdani, has received the endorsement of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nFinancially, Cuomo's campaign is supported by the New York Apartment Association, which plans to spend $2.5 million on his behalf. His campaign has also run ads targeting Hispanic voters, including a $100,000 ad buy related to the Puerto Rican Day Parade. In a recent debate, all nine Democratic candidates, including Cuomo and Mamdani, were united in their pledge to protect immigrants and maintain New York's status as a sanctuary city. In a separate strategic move, Cuomo announced the founding of his own independent party, 'Fight and Deliver', while remaining in the Democratic primary race.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–3 weeks (primary June 24, 2025; credible media calls could come election night or within ~1 week after RCV tabulation).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Cuomo wins the Democratic primary.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A late progressive consolidation behind Mamdani occurs: final-week endorsements and messaging unite non-Cuomo voters, turnout surges in progressive strongholds, and RCV transfers from eliminated left-leaning candidates flow overwhelmingly to Mamdani, allowing him to overtake Cuomo in late rounds. Alternatively, a late-breaking scandal or major gaffe depresses Cuomo’s support/turnout.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cuomo maintains his polling lead into Election Day, performs strongly with older, moderate, Latino, and Orthodox Jewish voters, and benefits from RCV transfers from other centrist or non-aligned candidates. Turnout patterns resemble recent NYC Democratic primaries that favor moderates, and credible outlets call him the presumptive nominee within days.",
    "rationale": "Status quo favors Cuomo. Multiple independent polls from March–May show him leading first-choice by double digits: SurveyUSA (Cuomo 43%, Mamdani 11), Marist (37–18 with an RCV simulation giving Cuomo >50% in round 5), Emerson/PIX11/The Hill (39–23), and earlier Honan Strategy Group and Data for Progress with similar margins. This persistence across pollsters and time suggests a stable advantage. Endorsements and coalition signals also favor Cuomo: support from several Orthodox communities, some Latino alignment (Marc Anthony; targeted Hispanic outreach), and significant independent expenditure backing from real estate (NY Apartment Association planning $2.5M). NYC Democratic primary electorates in recent cycles tend to be older and more moderate than the city overall, a pattern that has benefited candidates with Cuomo’s profile. RCV generally rewards broad acceptability; Cuomo’s name recognition and moderate positioning could attract later-round transfers from non-left candidates. Countervailing factors keep the probability below the mid-80s: (1) RCV uncertainty — if non-Cuomo voters cohere behind Mamdani, late-round transfers could flip the result; (2) enthusiasm and organizing advantages for progressives, with AOC’s endorsement potentially catalyzing consolidation and turnout; (3) Cuomo’s liabilities (baggage from 2021 resignation) that could depress his ceiling or spur late-breaking negatives; (4) potential late shifts if other candidates exit or if there’s a significant debate moment or scandal. What would raise my forecast: fresh high-quality polling in the final 10 days showing Cuomo >45% first-choice or widening margin, new citywide union endorsements for Cuomo, or signs of strong early vote/turnout in moderate outer-borough areas aligned with his coalition. What would lower it: credible late polls showing a single-digit race, visible consolidation of endorsements/field around Mamdani, negative revelations about Cuomo, or turnout indicators suggesting an unusually young/progressive electorate. Overall, with ~two weeks left and consistent leads plus coalition/money advantages, Cuomo is the clear favorite but not a lock.",
