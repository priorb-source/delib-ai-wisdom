    "review": "The two other forecasters arrived at nearly the same conclusion as I did, with forecasts of 18% and 17% compared to my initial 20%. We all identified the same core evidence: the very short timeline of less than a month, the complete lack of public preparatory steps for a campaign (staffing, filings), and the significant political headwinds of the Hope Florida probe and Donald Trump's endorsement of a primary rival, Byron Donalds. We also all identified the June 30 fundraising deadline as the single most compelling, albeit unlikely, catalyst for a 'Yes' outcome. Their reasoning was highly convincing and served to reinforce my own. The main new consideration they raised was a stronger emphasis on the typical patterns of campaign launches, highlighting that the absence of leaks about staff hires or donor meetings is itself strong evidence against an imminent announcement.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am making a small downward adjustment to my forecast. My initial reasoning remains largely the same, but the other forecasters correctly placed a stronger emphasis on the lack of 'pre-launch signals.' My 20% forecast might have slightly over-weighted the possibility of a surprise announcement timed to the Q2 fundraising deadline. The complete absence of behind-the-scenes reporting on staff hires, consultant retention, or major donor outreach—which typically precede a major campaign launch—makes a sudden announcement in the next 25 days even less likely. The arguments from the other forecasters have convinced me to weigh this lack of precursor activity more heavily. Therefore, I am lowering my probability to better reflect the strong consensus that while a June announcement is a strategic possibility, the observable evidence points overwhelmingly against it.",
