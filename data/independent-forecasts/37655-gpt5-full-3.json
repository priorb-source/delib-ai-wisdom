  "information": "Under Ukrainian law, specifically Article 19 of the Law “On the Legal Regime of Martial Law,” scheduling or holding national elections is forbidden while martial law is in effect. On May 15, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) voted to prolong martial law and general mobilization until at least August 6, 2025. The parliamentary rules of procedure also stipulate that once martial law is lifted, the date for the next presidential election must be set no less than 90 days in advance.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's office officially denied media reports suggesting that presidential elections were being planned for July 2025. Sources within the president's office and the Ukrainian government told BBC News Ukraine that no meetings had been held nor instructions given to prepare for elections, labeling the reports as 'fake or manipulative information.' President Zelensky has repeatedly stated that the question of holding elections can only be considered after the conflict is resolved.\n\nFormer President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced on February 16, 2025, that the next presidential elections will take place on October 26, 2025. He claimed his information came from multiple sources, including the Office of the President, law enforcement agencies, the Central Election Commission, and a printing plant which, he alleged, was already calculating the number of ballots required. This followed earlier reports in March 2025 from The Economist, which, citing anonymous sources in the Ukrainian government, had suggested President Zelensky was planning to announce a surprise election for July 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Martial law remains in force through July 1, 2025, with no legal changes. The Verkhovna Rada and/or Central Election Commission make no formal resolution setting a presidential election date, consistent with the current prohibition on scheduling elections under martial law and leadership statements deferring elections until after the conflict.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine lifts martial law in June 2025 and the Verkhovna Rada promptly passes a formal resolution setting an election date (e.g., in October), or parliament amends the martial law framework to explicitly allow scheduling while martial law is in effect and then officially sets a date before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time and law: On May 15, 2025, the Rada extended martial law to at least August 6, 2025. Article 19 of the Law on Martial Law forbids scheduling or holding national elections while martial law is in effect. Therefore, an official act setting a date before July 1 would require either (a) lifting martial law early or (b) amending the law. Both steps are politically and procedurally heavy lifts within ~6 weeks.\n- Procedural timing reduces urgency: Once martial law is lifted, the date must be set at least ~90 days in advance. For a rumored October 26, 2025 election, the latest setting date would be around July 28, 2025—after the question’s cutoff. This creates no incentive to announce before July 1, especially given current legal constraints.\n- Public signals: The President’s office has denied July 2025 election plans and emphasized elections only after the conflict. Reports from The Economist and Poroshenko’s claim of an Oct 26 date do not overcome the formal legal barrier to announcing now. If Oct 26 is the plan, it can be set after July 1 once conditions permit, further lowering the likelihood of an announcement by the cutoff.\n- Why not higher: Multiple hurdles must be cleared quickly—either lifting martial law or amending it—contrary to yesterday’s extension and recent official messaging. Security conditions remain volatile.\n- Why not lower: A small chance remains that Kyiv moves unexpectedly to amend the law or lift martial law earlier than planned (e.g., for political, diplomatic, or security reasons) and then promptly sets a date. Also, an authoritative body could, in theory, make a formal announcement specifying a date if the legal framework were changed swiftly.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting of draft legislation to permit scheduling under martial law; coalition support in the Rada to pass it quickly; signals from the President’s office endorsing near-term scheduling; signs of an early lifting of martial law in June. What would move me down: Further hard commitments from leadership ruling out any legal changes before July; escalation on the front; additional extensions or reaffirmations that no election-related acts will occur under martial law.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
