    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days (from May 22, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Databricks does not announce IPO plans before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks continues as a private company and maintains its position that 2025 is not the right time to go public. The company makes no SEC Form S-1 filing and no IPO announcement appears on their website before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite previous statements, Databricks reverses course due to improved market conditions, investor pressure, or strategic considerations and either files an SEC Form S-1 or announces IPO plans on their website before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The strongest evidence against an IPO announcement is the CEO's explicit statement that 'it's dumb to IPO this year,' which directly refers to 2025. This suggests a firm stance against going public in the current timeframe. With only 40 days remaining until the resolution date, the time window is quite narrow for a major strategic reversal. IPO decisions typically involve extensive preparation, board approvals, and market timing considerations that don't happen overnight. The research assistant provided no information suggesting any recent change in Databricks' IPO stance or market developments that would pressure them to reconsider. The status quo strongly favors 'No' because companies rarely make such dramatic reversals in short timeframes, especially after public statements from leadership. However, I'm not forecasting extremely low (0-5%) because: (1) 40 days is still meaningful time for an announcement, (2) we don't know the exact date or full context of the CEO's statement, (3) announcing 'planning' an IPO is a lower bar than executing one - they could announce plans while targeting a later execution date, and (4) market conditions or strategic considerations could shift. For me to update upward, I would need: evidence of changed market conditions, reports of investor pressure, leaked information about IPO preparations, or any signals from Databricks suggesting reconsideration. For me to update downward, I would need: more recent, emphatic statements ruling out 2025 IPO plans, or evidence of strategic moves incompatible with near-term IPO plans.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
