  "information": "On May 2, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly denied a Politico report that the administration was considering lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, calling the claim 'unequivocally false.' Both Rubio and U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum are reported to be opponents of the idea. Furthermore, reports from May 5, 2025, indicated that President Trump is considering a bipartisan bill that would impose 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian energy and expand existing sanctions.\n\nA Politico report from April 24, 2025, citing multiple sources, claimed the White House was discussing the possibility of lifting sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as part of negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine. The report stated that U.S. Special Envoy Steve Wietkoff was the main proponent of the initiative and had instructed his team to compile a list of all energy sanctions imposed on Russia. Other reports have mentioned proposals from American investors and the former CEO of Nord Stream 2 AG to restart the pipeline with U.S. participation.\n\nThe European Union has expressed a lack of interest in restoring the pipeline's operation, and is reportedly preparing new sanctions against Russia. Nord Stream 2 AG has also faced legal and financial setbacks in Europe. In April 2025, a German court upheld a bank's decision to terminate the company's accounts due to U.S. sanctions risks. The company is operating under a moratorium on bankruptcy in Switzerland and has been making payments to small creditors to facilitate a larger financial settlement. One of the two pipeline strings was severely damaged in an attack in September 2022.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Nord Stream 2 AG remains on OFAC’s SDN List on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration maintains or tightens Russia energy sanctions; OFAC leaves Nord Stream 2 AG on the SDN List. No Ukraine settlement with sanctions relief materializes before July 1. EU remains opposed to reviving the pipeline, and the company’s legal/financial troubles persist, leaving no policy impetus to delist.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "OFAC removes Nord Stream 2 AG from the SDN List before July 1 due to: (a) a negotiated Ukraine settlement in which the U.S. offers targeted energy-sanctions relief as a concession; or (b) a technical cleanup following dissolution/liquidation of the Swiss-based company, leading Treasury to delist it as defunct.",
    "rationale": "- Operationalization: This resolves Yes only if Nord Stream 2 AG is not on OFAC’s SDN List when checked on/after July 1, 2025. Any waivers or rhetoric that don’t remove the SDN listing still resolve No.\n- Status quo and policy signals favor No. The U.S. Secretary of State publicly called reports of contemplating a lift “unequivocally false,” and senior officials (Rubio, Burgum) are reportedly opposed. Additional reports say the President is weighing a bipartisan bill to impose 500% tariffs on importers of Russian energy and expand sanctions—directionally hawkish, not permissive.\n- Europe’s stance reduces incentives to delist. The EU shows no appetite to restart Nord Stream 2 and is preparing new Russia sanctions. With one string damaged since 2022 and the company under Swiss bankruptcy moratorium and facing banking restrictions, delisting would yield little practical benefit but carry high political cost.\n- Time is short. With ~8 weeks left, a major policy reversal culminating in an OFAC delisting is unlikely absent a breakthrough Ukraine settlement. OFAC can act quickly, but the bar for a high-profile Russia delisting is very high.\n- Why not lower? There is some non-zero chance given: (1) Politico’s report of internal White House discussion suggests the idea has at least been on the table; (2) a deal-making posture could lead to symbolic, low-cost concessions (delisting an inoperable entity) in exchange for larger Russian concessions; (3) a technical delisting could occur if the company is formally dissolved and Treasury decides to remove it from SDN for list hygiene.\n- Why not higher? Strong public denials, domestic political costs, ongoing consideration of tougher measures, EU opposition, and the short timeline together make rapid delisting improbable.\n- What would move me up: credible, on-the-record indications from Treasury/State about targeted energy-sanctions relief; a public Ukraine ceasefire/settlement framework including sanctions rollbacks; concrete Swiss legal developments showing imminent dissolution of Nord Stream 2 AG coupled with OFAC signaling a delisting; allied coordination pointing to a broader sanctions recalibration.\n- What would move me down: new U.S. sanctions designations on Russian energy infrastructure; legislative momentum on the 500% tariff bill; further Russian escalation; or fresh, explicit White House statements ruling out any delisting before a settlement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 2, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly denied a Politico report that the administration was considering lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, calling the claim 'unequivocally false.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
