    "review": "The other forecasters provide valuable additional evidence that strengthens the case for No. Forecaster 2's point about major financial institutions (Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley) actively PUSHING BACK their rate cut forecasts is particularly compelling - this represents a directional shift away from early cuts, not just static pessimism. Goldman moving from July to December is a dramatic revision. Forecaster 3 adds important market pricing data via CME FedWatch showing September or later expectations, which is a concrete signal from participants with money at stake. Both correctly emphasize the practical constraint of likely only ONE FOMC meeting before July 1 (mid-June), which I should have highlighted more. The convergence between Forecaster 2 and my initial 18% is notable. However, the new evidence about market pricing, institutional forecast trends moving AWAY from early cuts, and the singular meeting constraint all point toward even lower probability than 18%. The one countervailing consideration is Forecaster 3's prudent observation about uncertainty over 6-7 weeks, which prevents going too low.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, the additional evidence reinforces my bearish stance but suggests I should adjust slightly lower. The CME FedWatch market pricing pointing to September or later, combined with the clear trend of major institutions pushing their forecasts backward (not just maintaining pessimistic views, but actively revising away from early cuts), indicates even less probability than my initial 18%. The constraint of only one FOMC meeting before July 1 is more binding than I initially weighted. However, I cannot go drastically lower because: (1) 6-7 weeks remains enough time for unexpected economic deterioration or financial stress, (2) the Fed could theoretically announce an emergency cut if conditions warranted, and (3) some residual uncertainty is appropriate. The core fundamentals remain: patient Fed stance, elevated inflation at 2.7%, strong labor market, and no signals of imminent cuts. I'm updating down to 15% to reflect the stronger-than-initially-assessed market consensus and institutional forecast trends, while maintaining a probability floor for tail risks.",
