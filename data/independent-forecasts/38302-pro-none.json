    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. The data for May 2025 is typically released by China's National Bureau of Statistics in the second week of June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The established trend for the last three months (February, March, April 2025) has been year-over-year deflation. A continuation of this trend would result in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The May CPI reading is 0.0% or higher. This could be driven by a combination of government stimulus measures finally taking hold to boost consumer demand, a favorable base effect from May 2024, and a modest rise in global commodity prices, particularly energy.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The May CPI reading is negative. This would occur if persistent weak domestic demand, stemming from the ongoing property market crisis and cautious consumer sentiment, continues to outweigh government support measures. Industrial overcapacity would also contribute by forcing producers to keep prices low.",
    "rationale": "My forecast places significant weight on the established economic momentum. The background indicates that China has already experienced three consecutive months of deflation (February, March, April 2025). Such trends, rooted in deep structural issues like a prolonged property sector downturn and weak consumer confidence, do not typically reverse sharply in a single month. These factors create a persistent drag on domestic demand, which is the primary driver of the current deflationary pressure. While the Chinese government is actively implementing counter-cyclical policies to stimulate the economy, the impact of such measures on broad price indices like the CPI often involves a time lag. It is plausible that any stimulus introduced in recent months has not yet fully filtered through to consumer spending by May.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the Chinese government has a strong mandate to prevent a deflationary spiral and possesses a wide array of policy tools. There is a non-trivial chance that recently enacted stimulus, a policy surprise, or a favorable base effect from May 2024 could be sufficient to push the year-over-year CPI into neutral or positive territory.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the underlying causes of the deflationary pressure are severe and not easily resolved. The combination of industrial overcapacity, the wealth effect from the housing crisis, and cautious household saving behavior creates a difficult environment for generating inflation. The evidence from the preceding three months provides a strong signal that these deflationary forces currently have the upper hand.\n\nI would update my forecast higher (towards Yes) if high-frequency data for May (e.g., retail sales, PMI) were to come in significantly below expectations. I would update lower (towards No) on news of a major, direct consumer stimulus package (e.g., direct cash handouts) or a sharp, unexpected rise in global energy prices.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill China experience a 4th month in a row of deflation in its May CPI report?\n\nQuestion background:\nSCMP: [China’s consumer prices fall in April, fuelling fears of deflation](https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3309834/chinas-consumer-prices-fall-april-fuelling-fears-deflation)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the \"Percent Change from Year Ago, Not Seasonally Adjusted\" data presented at [FRED Consumer Price Indices (CPIs, HICPs), COICOP 1999: Consumer Price Index: Total for China (CHNCPIALLMINMEI)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CHNCPIALLMINMEI#) is negative for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
