    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the core inertia argument and the short runway to July 1. Forecaster 2 usefully emphasizes that even minor website text changes at USDA typically require internal approvals and can be slower than outsiders expect—this slightly lowers my weight on the “quick symbolic edit” path to No. Forecaster 3 highlights the narrow resolution criterion and notes the small but real risk of unrelated site refreshes or preemptive edits; that aligns with my earlier concern about exact-phrase sensitivity. Neither adds concrete new evidence of imminent updates, but their process-based points modestly strengthen the status-quo case. I find their reasoning convincing overall and will adjust upward slightly.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~6 weeks. A policy-driven removal or reversal is very unlikely within that window due to APA rulemaking timelines. The main No paths are (a) communications edit removing or rephrasing the example list so that “snack foods” no longer appears, or (b) a routine site refresh that changes wording. While these are operationally feasible, there’s no signal they’re prioritized, and USDA web content typically moves through multi-step reviews. I now put lower odds on a rapid “symbolic” text change given the internal process friction highlighted by others. I still keep some downside for exact-phrase fragility (e.g., switching to “snacks,” removing examples, or page reorg). Roughly: 10–12% for comms tweak, 2–3% for incidental site changes, leaving ~86% that the phrase persists through July 1 when Metaculus checks.",
