    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my priors: strong intra-party signaling that Ouattara will ultimately run, but clear incentives and precedent to delay a personal declaration. New useful nuances they added: (1) early declaration could amplify international and domestic criticism over a de facto fourth term, strengthening the incentive to wait; (2) age/health risk management for an 83-year-old incumbent also argues for preserving flexibility; (3) they emphasize the possibility of a quickly convened May RHDP congress or set-piece address that could flip this to Yes on short notice. I find their reasoning coherent. Where I remain more conservative is on the near-term event schedule: there’s no public sign of a May nominating congress or a formalized timeline, and the opposition’s weakening reduces urgency. Still, their points about a choreographed, rapid May announcement to cement party unity justify nudging my estimate up modestly.",
    "rationale": "We have ~33 days until the cutoff. The bar is a personal declaration by Ouattara. Signals: multiple senior RHDP figures have publicly said he will be the candidate, but Ouattara himself maintained ambiguity as recently as January. Opposition hurdles (Thiam’s ineligibility ruling; Gbagbo excluded; Soro in exile) lower pressure for an early move and favor strategic delay, minimizing time for mobilization against a controversial additional term. Historical pattern also leans late (his 2020 declaration was in August for an October vote). The absence of a publicly known May congress or announcement path keeps the May hazard modest. Countervailing considerations: the party may want to lock unity, deter intra-party jockeying, and leverage elite momentum via a swift May congress or address—these can materialize quickly in this context. Balancing these, I keep the probability below one-third but tick it up from my prior to reflect the plausible, short-notice May announcement scenario raised by the other forecasters.",
