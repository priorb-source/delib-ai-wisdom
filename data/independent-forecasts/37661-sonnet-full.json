  "information": "The Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) granted two 10-year licenses to Starlink Services Bangladesh Limited, as reported on April 30, 2025. This allows the company to provide commercial internet services and import necessary equipment. The approval followed Starlink's registration with the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) on March 29, 2025. Public statements from SpaceX executives and Bangladeshi government officials have targeted a May 2025 launch. In late March, interim leader Muhammad Yunus announced plans to finalize a commercial deal with Starlink within three months. A trial run of the service was conducted on April 9, 2025, during an investment summit.\n\nIn mid-May 2025, U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, along with other Senate Democrats, called for a federal investigation into whether the Trump administration helped SpaceX secure foreign deals, including in Bangladesh. The senators allege that favorable treatment from foreign governments may have been exchanged for tariff favors, which they described as potential 'crony capitalism' and a 'quid pro quo' that could violate federal ethics laws. They have written to the Department of Justice and the White House ethics office requesting a probe into the matter.\n\nThe typical time between Starlink receiving a license and service being listed as 'Available' in a country has ranged from under three months to over one year. Faster rollouts have generally occurred in countries that issued express government invitations and where Starlink had an existing ground station or permission to use foreign gateways. SpaceX can serve Bangladesh using its existing laser-linked satellites without waiting for local gateways to be built. Following the license approval, it was reported that Starlink is preparing a tariff plan to be submitted to the Bangladeshi regulator for review.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "45 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - As of May 16, 2025, Bangladesh is not yet listed as 'Available' on the Starlink map",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Regulatory delays in tariff approval, bureaucratic processing times, or operational readiness issues cause the launch to slip into July or later. The U.S. investigation into ethics concerns creates additional complications. SpaceX prioritizes other markets or encounters unexpected technical challenges despite having the satellite infrastructure ready.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink's tariff plan receives rapid regulatory approval in the coming days. Given the express government invitation and ability to serve Bangladesh via laser-linked satellites without local gateways, SpaceX accelerates the rollout to meet the publicly stated May 2025 target (or early June). The service goes live and is listed as 'Available' on the website by late May or mid-June.",
    "rationale": "This forecast weighs several competing factors. Favorable indicators include: (1) the expedited license approval in late April, (2) Bangladesh's express government invitation and high-level support from interim leader Muhammad Yunus, (3) the completed trial run in April, (4) SpaceX's ability to serve the country via existing laser-linked satellites without waiting for local infrastructure, and (5) historical precedent showing faster rollouts in countries with these conditions.\n\nHowever, concerning factors include: (1) we're now mid-May and the publicly stated May 2025 target hasn't been met, suggesting timeline slippage, (2) the tariff plan still requires regulatory review and approval, (3) only 16 days have passed since license approval - on the shorter end of typical rollout timelines, (4) the U.S. Senate investigation adds uncertainty even if it doesn't directly delay operations, and (5) the typical 'fast' rollout timeline of 'under three months' from license to availability would theoretically allow meeting the July 1 deadline, but with minimal buffer.\n\nThe status quo favors 'No' since the service isn't live yet and we're running against a tight deadline. Historical patterns suggest 3+ months is common, though express government invitations and ready infrastructure have enabled faster launches. The fact that 2 months from license date (April 30) takes us to June 30 - cutting it extremely close to July 1 - means any minor delay would miss the deadline.\n\nFor this forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of: imminent tariff approval, SpaceX announcements of launch dates, or the service actually appearing on the availability map. For it to move lower, I would need evidence of: regulatory pushback, extended tariff review timelines, or public statements indicating delays into Q3.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Bangladesh as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Bangladeshi leader gives final approval to Musk's Starlink service](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/bangladeshi-leader-gives-final-approval-to-musks-starlink-service/3551404)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
