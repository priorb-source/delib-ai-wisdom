  "information": "The global economic environment shows signs of slowing. The U.S. Energy Department forecasts that global oil consumption growth will be less than 1 million barrels per day in 2025 and 2026, a significant drop from the historical average, partly due to economic slowdowns in Asia. China's manufacturing PMI for May rose to 49.5 but remained in contractionary territory for the second straight month, although sub-indexes for production and new orders improved. In the Eurozone, industrial production grew in early 2025, but the outlook is considered uncertain due to potential U.S. tariffs.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 weeks. The data for May 2025, which determines the outcome, is scheduled for release on or around June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The most recent data for April 2025 showed positive year-over-year growth of 1.48803%. A simple continuation of this trend would result in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A combination of cooling domestic demand and weakening export orders, influenced by the global slowdown, causes a sharp month-over-month contraction in May. This decline is significant enough to erase the gains from the previous year, pushing the year-over-year growth figure into negative territory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Economic momentum from April carries into May. Core manufacturing sectors remain stable, and utility output is robust. Despite global headwinds, domestic activity is sufficient to maintain a positive year-over-year growth rate, even if it is modest.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily anchored by the most recent available data, which shows a positive year-over-year growth of 1.488% for April 2025. Given the very short time horizon—the May data is the very next data point—this positive momentum is the strongest available signal. Economic indicators like industrial production exhibit significant inertia and rarely reverse from solid growth to contraction in a single month without a major economic shock.\n\nThe research provided highlights legitimate downside risks. The slowing global oil demand and China's contracting manufacturing PMI suggest weakening external demand, which could act as a drag on U.S. production. This information tempers my confidence and is the primary reason my forecast is not higher, for example in the 95-100% range. These global factors are more likely to manifest as a gradual softening over several months rather than an abrupt plunge in May.\nMy probability is not lower because that would imply a significant chance of a sharp, negative reversal for which there is currently no direct evidence. The 1.488% growth in April provides a meaningful buffer, making a negative reading for May statistically unlikely without a specific, disruptive event occurring during that month.\nI would increase my probability forecast if leading indicators for May, such as regional Fed manufacturing surveys or the ISM Manufacturing PMI, came in stronger than expected. Conversely, I would lower my forecast upon news of a significant, unforeseen negative shock that occurred in May, such as a major supply chain disruption or a sudden spike in energy prices.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill monthly US Industrial production have positive year-over-year growth for May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Real Economy Blog: [Industrial production index hits record high amid tariffs](https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/industrial-production-index-rises-to-record-amid-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the monthly number displayed at FRED [Industrial Production: Total Index (INDPRO)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INDPRO#) for year-over-year growth is greater than 0.0 for May 2025, when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nWhen accessing the data, ensure settings are Units: Percent Change from Year Ago, Seasonally Adjusted and Frequency: Monthly. For example, the number for April 2025 was 1.48803 as of May 27, 2025.\n\nSince the numbers presented by FRED are expected to be preliminary numbers from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, please note that subsequent revisions to the number will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe global economic environment shows signs of slowing.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
