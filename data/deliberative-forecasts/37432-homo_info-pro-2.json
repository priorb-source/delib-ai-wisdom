    "review": "My initial forecast of 25% was based on balancing the Ohio GOP's supermajority against the very tight legislative timeline. Forecaster 3 shared a similar view, weighting the political power more heavily for a 40% forecast. However, Forecaster 2 introduced a critical and decisive piece of evidence that I had not considered: in February 2025, Republican lawmakers actively removed a proof-of-citizenship provision from the state's transportation budget. I find this argument extremely convincing. This act of 'revealed preference'—choosing *not* to enact the policy when a vehicle was available—is a much stronger signal of current legislative intent than general party control. It suggests a lack of consensus or prioritization that makes a successful, rapid push for a new bill before the deadline highly improbable. Forecaster 3's reasoning, while sound in a vacuum, is undermined by this specific, recent event.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward based on the new information provided by Forecaster 2. My initial 25% forecast was primarily driven by the short timeframe but was balanced by the raw power of the Republican supermajority. The key new information is that Republican lawmakers recently and deliberately removed a proof-of-citizenship provision from another bill. This action strongly implies that the political will or internal consensus to pass such a measure does not currently exist, at least not as a high priority. For this legislation to be enacted by July 1, the legislature would not only have to overcome significant time and procedural hurdles but also reverse a policy decision made just a few months ago. The combination of legislative inertia, a tight calendar, and now clear evidence of a lack of will makes the 'No' outcome overwhelmingly likely. My initial forecast was too high because it overestimated the party's desire to act on this specific issue right now. I am now aligning with Forecaster 2's probability, as the 10% chance adequately covers the low-probability scenario where party leadership unexpectedly reverses course and uses its supermajority to force the bill through in the final weeks of the session.",
