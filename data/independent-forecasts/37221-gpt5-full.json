  "information": "According to public statements, François Villeroy de Galhau, a member of the European Central Bank (ECB) council, indicated there is room for gradual interest rate reductions as inflation approaches the central bank's 2% target. The ECB has implemented seven interest rate cuts since mid-2024, lowering the benchmark deposit rate to 2.25% as of its April 2025 meeting. ECB President Christine Lagarde has noted that future policy decisions will be data-dependent, citing 'unprecedented uncertainty'. A report from Qatar National Bank (QNB) stated that the ECB is expected to continue its interest rate cutting cycle in 2025, driven by a weak economic outlook for the Euro Area and stabilized inflation.\n\nOfficial data from Eurostat showed the euro area annual inflation rate was 2.2% in March 2025, down from 2.3% in February. The primary contributors to the March inflation rate were services (+1.56 percentage points), followed by food, alcohol & tobacco (+0.57 pp), and non-energy industrial goods (+0.16 pp). Energy prices had a negative contribution (-0.10 pp). According to news reports citing polls from Bloomberg and Reuters, the consensus among economists for the April 2025 inflation figure is 2.1%. A quarterly Survey of Professional Forecasters by the ECB indicated that inflation for 2025 is expected to be 2.2%, with a forecast of 2.0% for 2026.\n\nRecent economic indicators point to a weak economic outlook for the Eurozone. Real GDP growth forecasts for 2025 have been subject to downward revisions. For ten consecutive months, the composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks business activity, has remained below or near the 50-point threshold separating contraction from expansion. The ECB's Wage Tracker Index indicates a rapid deceleration in wage increases from the peak observed in late 2024. This trend is expected to reduce price pressures in the labor-intensive services sector. Other disinflationary drivers include easing food inflation and a negative year-on-year contribution from energy prices.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 days (Eurostat flash estimate for April 2025 expected around Apr 30, which Trading Economics typically reflects).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — momentum and consensus point to 2.1%–2.2%, not above 2.2%.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Disinflation persists: services ease with slower wage growth, food inflation continues to cool, and energy remains a small negative YoY. The flash prints 2.1% (or 2.2%), which Trading Economics would display as ≤2.2%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An upside surprise from Easter-timed services (travel, recreation) and a smaller negative or positive energy contribution lifts the headline to 2.3% on the flash, which Trading Economics would display as above 2.2%.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and trend: Euro area headline HICP was 2.2% in March (down from 2.3% in February), with weakening growth, easing food inflation, decelerating wages, and a negative energy contribution. This points to continued mild disinflation into April. \n- Consensus: Bloomberg/Reuters polls center on 2.1% for April, below the 2.2% threshold. Hitting “Yes” requires at least 2.3% on Trading Economics (since “above 2.2%” excludes 2.2%), implying a ≥0.2pp upside surprise versus consensus. Historical flash surprises for the euro area are typically small (≈0.1–0.2pp), so the probability of a +0.2pp move or larger is meaningful but limited.\n- Drivers: Services remain the main upside risk. The 2025 Easter falls in April (vs. late March in 2024), which can push up travel/recreation prices and complicate seasonal adjustment, providing potential upside. Offsetting this, wage growth has slowed and the broader economy is soft, reducing persistent services pressure. Energy was slightly negative YoY in March; unless oil and utilities effects flip materially positive in April, energy’s contribution likely remains near zero to slightly negative. Food disinflation continues to lean downward.\n- Status quo weighting: Given the gradual nature of inflation dynamics and recent momentum, the base case is a print at or just below March (2.1–2.2), i.e., a No. The Easter/energy combo creates a non-trivial but minority chance of 2.3%.\n- Why not higher: To forecast >35–40% would require clear evidence of strong April energy pass-through and/or unusually large Easter-related services strength beyond what forecasters already model—evidence we lack. \n- Why not lower: A very low probability (e.g., <15%) would ignore the genuine upside risks from Easter timing and potential energy normalization, both capable of adding ~0.1–0.2pp.\n- What would move me up: Credible indications of a sharp April rebound in energy prices feeding into HICP, broad-based services price spikes tied to Easter/early travel season, or reliable leaks/nowcasts pointing to a 2.3% flash.\n- What would move me down: Further data or leaks indicating weak services inflation in April, continued sizable negative energy contributions, or consensus shifting to 2.0% with tight uncertainty bands.",
