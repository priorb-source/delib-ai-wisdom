  "information": "Beyond Meat's financial results for the first quarter of 2025 showed a 9.1% year-over-year decline in net revenues to $68.7 million. The company reported a net loss of $52.9 million and a gross loss of $1.1 million, resulting in a gross margin of -1.5%. While the company's international business revenue grew, its U.S. retail channel revenue fell by 15.4%. Citing weak consumer demand and macroeconomic volatility, Beyond Meat withdrew its annual sales forecast for 2025 and issued a revised outlook for the second quarter with expected net revenues between $80 million and $85 million.\n\nAs of March 2025, Beyond Meat had $116 million in cash on hand. The company's liabilities included $1.15 billion in convertible bonds maturing in 2027, which were reported to be trading at 17 cents on the dollar. On May 7, 2025, the company announced it had secured a new $100 million senior secured financing facility. The loan has an initial term of 4.75 years with an interest rate of 12% until February 2030, payable in kind, meaning interest is added to the loan's principal instead of being paid in cash during this period.\n\nIn response to its financial performance, Beyond Meat has implemented several operational changes, including a 17% workforce reduction for non-production staff and a suspension of its operations in China. Management stated its strategic priorities include restoring product distribution within the U.S. market and improving consumer perception through new marketing campaigns. The stated long-term goal for the company is to achieve EBITDA-positive operations by the end of 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The company will continue to operate using its cash on hand and new financing, without filing for bankruptcy within this short timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beyond Meat uses its existing cash reserves and the newly secured $100 million financing facility to fund operations through the second quarter. Management continues executing its turnaround plan, including cost reductions and new marketing, successfully avoiding a liquidity crisis that would force a bankruptcy filing before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the new financing, a severe and unexpected event occurs, such as a catastrophic drop in sales far exceeding already lowered expectations, the discovery of a major accounting irregularity, or a key supplier demanding immediate payment. This event precipitates a sudden liquidity crisis, forcing the company's board to determine that an immediate Chapter 11 filing is the only viable option to preserve value.",
    "rationale": "My forecast for a low probability of bankruptcy in the near term is primarily driven by Beyond Meat's recent successful effort to secure a new $100 million senior secured financing facility on May 7, 2025. This action provides the company with a crucial liquidity lifeline. Companies that have just raised capital, even expensive debt, rarely file for bankruptcy in the immediate aftermath. This new funding, combined with their $116 million in cash as of March 2025, should be sufficient to cover their operational cash burn for well beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline, deferring the immediate threat of insolvency. The loan's pay-in-kind (PIK) interest feature further supports this by preventing cash drains for interest payments in the short term. The status quo for a business, even a distressed one, is to continue operating, and this financing strongly reinforces that inertia. \n\nHowever, the probability is not zero. The company's underlying fundamentals are extremely weak, as evidenced by a 9.1% revenue decline, a net loss of $52.9 million in the last quarter, a negative gross margin, and the withdrawal of its annual sales forecast. The company's $1.15 billion in convertible bonds trading at just 17 cents on the dollar signals profound market skepticism about its long-term viability. This underlying fragility means the company is vulnerable to shocks. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the new financing directly addresses the most common immediate trigger for bankruptcy: a lack of cash. A filing before July 1 would require a new, acute crisis to materialize in the next few weeks. My forecast is not lower because the company's severe financial distress and operational challenges cannot be completely ignored, making it more susceptible to unexpected negative events than a healthy company. \n\nI would increase my probability forecast if there were news of a major product recall, the abrupt departure of key executives, or an announcement that Q2 sales were tracking significantly below their revised, lowered guidance. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if the company pre-announced unexpectedly strong sales figures or another positive strategic development.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beyond Meat file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeyond Meat has had several years of losses and in the most recent quarter it [posted](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial) a loss from operations of almost $38 million.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Beyond Meat, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
