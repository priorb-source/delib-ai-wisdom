    "review": "The other two forecasters presented reasoning that was highly aligned with my own, creating a strong consensus. We all identified the extremely short 16-day timeframe and the complete lack of any public signals (announcements, leaks, reports of advance teams) as the overwhelmingly dominant factors favoring a 'No' outcome. The other forecasters effectively articulated that any 'Yes' outcome would require an extraordinary break from normal diplomatic and security protocols, such as a secret mission or an emergency summit. I found Forecaster 3's framing of 'base rates' (presidential trips to China are rare and planned far in advance) and 'calendar constraints' (no multilateral events to piggyback on) to be particularly useful additions that provide a more structured basis for our shared conclusion. There is no substantive disagreement on the core logic.",
    "rationale": "My initial analysis, which concluded that a visit is exceptionally unlikely, remains unchanged. The deliberation process with my peers has reinforced this conclusion. The arguments raised by the other forecasters, particularly regarding base rates and the lack of any anchoring events on the calendar, strengthen the case for a 'No' outcome. However, both other experts independently arrived at a 2% probability, slightly higher than my initial 1%. This suggests a consensus that my estimate of the small 'tail risk' of a surprise event might have been slightly too low. While the arguments presented make me more confident in a very low number, the consensus from other experts is a valuable signal for calibration. Acknowledging that unconventional diplomatic events, while rare, are not impossible, I am adjusting my forecast upward by one percentage point to align with the group consensus. This change reflects a minor recalibration of the odds of a high-impact, low-probability event from roughly 99-to-1 against to 49-to-1 against, which seems reasonable when considering the potential for unconventional actions by the individuals involved.",
