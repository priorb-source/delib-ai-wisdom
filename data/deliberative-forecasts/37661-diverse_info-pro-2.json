    "review": "The other forecasters introduced crucial new information and perspectives. Forecaster 3 provided the most impactful evidence, which I had not considered: a series of concrete, recent milestones including the issuance of BTRC licenses on April 30, a successful public trial, and public statements targeting a May 2025 launch. This fundamentally reframes the question from 'can they start and finish' to 'can they complete the final steps'. Forecaster 2's caution about the short timeline and the introduction of a new risk factor (a US Senate Democratic inquiry) are valid points for temperance, but I find the specific, positive evidence of progress within Bangladesh to be more compelling and directly relevant. Forecaster 3's reasoning, grounded in these specific events, is highly convincing and makes a 'Yes' outcome appear much more likely than my initial analysis suggested.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 65% was based on the strong positive signal of the Prime Minister's 'final approval' but was moderated by the short timeline and uncertainty about the preceding administrative work. The new evidence presented by Forecaster 3, particularly that two 10-year licenses were already granted by the BTRC on April 30, 2025, and that there was a stated target of a May 2025 launch, significantly reduces this uncertainty. It demonstrates that the process is in its final logistical stages, not the beginning. The primary hurdles I anticipated have already been cleared. While Forecaster 2's point about a US political inquiry adds a minor risk, I assess its probability of delaying this specific launch within the next 45 days as low. The overwhelming evidence now points towards a launch being imminent. The remaining risks—final tariff approval, customs, payment systems—are real but seem manageable within the timeframe, especially given the clear momentum. Therefore, I am substantially increasing my forecast.",
