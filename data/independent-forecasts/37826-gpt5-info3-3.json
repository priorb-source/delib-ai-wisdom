  "information": "In the aftermath of the military engagements, India initiated a diplomatic offensive. The government dispatched seven all-party delegations to 32 countries for a diplomatic push scheduled between May 21 and June 5. These delegations were provided with 'talking points' and a 150-page dossier detailing India's position on cross-border terrorism. Politically, the Indian Prime Minister announced a new doctrine of 'no tolerance for terror that hides under nuclear blackmail'. In parallel, the Indian Army Chief, General Upendra Dwivedi, granted 'full authority' to the Western Commanders to retaliate with kinetic actions in response to any future violations of the ceasefire agreement by Pakistan.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Border tensions persist but remain confined to the Line of Control and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, with only sporadic, contained exchanges. Diplomacy (Indian delegations through early June and third-party pressure) cools tempers. No Indian artillery, air, or missile strike lands in Pakistan’s Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, or Balochistan during June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant ceasefire violation along the International Border/Working Boundary (e.g., in the Jammu–Sialkot sector) or a high-casualty terror incident in India traced to Pakistan prompts a calibrated Indian response. Western Command, having been delegated authority, conducts retaliatory artillery fire across the IB into Pakistan’s Punjab or a limited precision strike (air or missile) on a target in KP or Punjab during June.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Indian kinetic actions into Pakistan’s provinces are rare. The most salient precedent is the February 2019 Balakot airstrike in KP; most routine cross-border fire occurs along the LoC opposite Pakistan-administered Kashmir (which would not count for this question). On a pure base-rate, the monthly probability is very low.\n\nCurrent context (from the research assistant): India has launched a diplomatic push (seven all-party delegations to 32 countries between May 21 and June 5), the PM articulated a tougher doctrine (“no tolerance for terror that hides under nuclear blackmail”), and the Army Chief reportedly gave Western Command ‘full authority’ to execute kinetic retaliation to any future ceasefire violations. These signals raise the conditional probability of a localized retaliatory strike if Pakistan initiates a provocation—especially along the IB/Working Boundary where Pakistani territory is in Punjab, one of the qualifying provinces.\n\nWhy not higher: Even amid heightened tensions, India usually calibrates to avoid escalation into Pakistan proper due to nuclear risks and international pressure. The ongoing diplomatic offensive suggests New Delhi is courting international support and managing escalation, not seeking an immediate cross-border strike. Most firing, if it occurs, is likelier along the LoC into Pakistan-administered Kashmir (excluded by this question). Absent a major provocation, deep strikes into KP/Punjab or cross-IB artillery into Pakistani Punjab remain less likely than not in any single month.\n\nWhy not lower: The explicit delegation of authority to Western Command to retaliate to ceasefire violations makes a cross-IB kinetic response more plausible if there is firing from Pakistan’s side along the Working Boundary. Additionally, a high-profile terror incident in India in late May or June could trigger a Balakot-style punitive action into KP or Punjab.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of (1) significant Pakistani ceasefire violations along the IB/Working Boundary (Jammu–Sialkot/Lahore sectors), (2) a major terror attack in India with rapid attribution to Pakistan-based groups, (3) unusual Indian Air Force posturing (airspace closures, dispersal, CAP surge), or (4) official Indian rhetoric signaling imminent retaliation. Clear evidence that India’s diplomatic outreach is to pre-justify a strike would also raise odds.\n\nWhat would move me down: Verified de-escalation steps (hotline statements reaffirming the ceasefire, pullbacks), absence of significant incidents by mid-June, strong international mediation outcomes, or indications that any Indian retaliation will stay confined to Pakistan-administered Kashmir.\n\nNetting these factors, I place extra weight on the status quo (no strike into the four provinces) but acknowledge elevated risk given posture and delegation of authority.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack in Pakistan proper in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 India–Pakistan conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_conflict)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack on targets in one of the following provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nTo count, an attack must be [kinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_military_action), using explosive weaponry or physical violence. Non-kinetic actions such as a cyberattack would not count, even one resulting in deaths.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn the aftermath of the military engagements, India initiated a diplomatic offensive.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
