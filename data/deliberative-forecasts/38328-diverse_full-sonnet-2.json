    "review": "All three forecasts converge remarkably on 65-72%, suggesting strong consensus. The other forecasters raised several points worth considering:\n\n**Forecaster 3's Poisson modeling** is more rigorous than my rough baseline estimate. With λ≈1.0-1.3 for a 21-day period, baseline probability alone is 63-73% - this is higher than my initial 40-50% estimate and grounds the high probability more firmly.\n\n**Forecaster 2's disjunction argument** is compelling: for a No outcome, ALL potential triggers (baseline turnover, scandal resignations, cabinet appointments) must fail simultaneously. This probability logic strengthens the case for a high forecast.\n\n**Forecaster 3's emphasis on Qatargate stickiness** is important. The fact that implicated MEPs resisted for months suggests the scandal pathway may not materialize within our narrow 21-day window, even with immunity votes scheduled mid-June. This tempering factor is worth weighting more heavily.\n\nThe key tension is between: (1) a strong baseline (63-73% from turnover alone), plus additional pathways, suggesting 70%+, versus (2) the narrow window and Qatargate precedent suggesting caution about assuming quick scandal-driven resignations.\n\nAll three of us appropriately identified that cabinet appointments remain uncertain in timing and could slip to July. The Portugal situation is still at the 'rumors' stage.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I'm adjusting my baseline probability estimate upward based on Forecaster 3's more rigorous Poisson calculation. If normal turnover alone provides 63-73% probability for at least one resignation in a 21-day window, and we have additional pathways through the Huawei scandal and potential cabinet appointments, the conjunction of these factors supports a forecast in the 68-75% range.\n\nHowever, I'm also giving more weight to the Qatargate precedent. The resistance of implicated MEPs for months suggests that even if immunity is lifted during the June 16-19 plenary, immediate resignations are not guaranteed. This tempers how much incremental probability the scandal adds beyond baseline.\n\nThe cabinet appointment pathway remains speculative - Portugal's situation involves 'rumors' and 'being considered,' not confirmed appointments. Government formations can extend beyond expected timelines.\n\nBalancing these factors: the strong statistical baseline (63-73%) provides the core of my forecast. The scandal adds some incremental probability despite Qatargate precedent, as does the cabinet possibility despite uncertainty. Multiple independent pathways increase overall probability through disjunction logic.\n\nI'm revising down slightly from 72% to 70% to account for: (1) Qatargate precedent suggesting scandal-driven resignations may not materialize quickly, (2) uncertainty in cabinet appointment timing, and (3) the narrow 21-day window. However, the strong baseline and multiple pathways prevent me from going lower.",
