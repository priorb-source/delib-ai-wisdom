    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize that the 87-day window (April 5 to July 1) aligns well with typical FSIS foreign-matter recall timelines of 4-12 weeks. They make compelling points about Johnsonville's resources, the relative simplicity of foreign matter vs. pathogen contamination, and base rates suggesting many recalls of this type close within 2-3 months. These are valid considerations I underweighted in my initial analysis. However, both forecasters appear to treat the full 87-day window as available time, when in fact 34 days have already elapsed without closure. This is not necessarily pessimistic news - we're at week 5 of a typical 4-12 week process - but it does mean we only have 53 days (7.5 weeks) remaining. If this recall is following a longer timeline within the typical range (e.g., 10-12 weeks), we could miss the deadline. Neither forecaster addresses why 34 days have passed without closure if these recalls are straightforward. The lack of any reported progress or complications is neutral information, but the continued 'Active' status after 5 weeks suggests this may not be on an expedited track.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward based on the specific timeline information about FSIS foreign-matter recalls provided by the other forecasters. The distinction between foreign matter and pathogen contamination is meaningful, and base rates of 4-12 weeks for closure are relevant. However, I'm not moving all the way to 70-75% because we must account for time already elapsed. We're now at week 5 of the recall with 7.5 weeks remaining until the deadline. If typical closures span 4-12 weeks, we're in the middle of that range with limited buffer. The recall would need to close in the next 7.5 weeks, meaning it would need to be on the faster half of the typical timeline. Given no evidence of progress and the reality that many recalls take 10-12 weeks, there's meaningful risk of missing the July 1 deadline. I'm settling on a probability that reflects both the reasonable timeframe remaining and the uncertainty created by time already elapsed without closure.",
