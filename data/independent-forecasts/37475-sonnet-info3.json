  "information": "Historical data on similar FSIS recalls provides context for typical closure timelines. Many previous recalls handled by Johnsonville were closed within 4 to 8 weeks. Broader data for Class I meat recalls of a similar size often shows closure within 2 to 4 months after the announcement. However, some cases can take longer; a recall for Tyson Fun Nuggets in 2023 took approximately four months to close. A January 2025 report from the Plastic Pollution Coalition also mentioned that several recalls from 2024 involving plastic contamination remained ongoing for several months after their initiation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 53 days (7.5 weeks) from May 9, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall would remain Active",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall investigation proves complex, product recovery is slower than anticipated, or additional affected batches are identified. FSIS keeps the recall in Active status past July 1, 2025 as they continue monitoring the situation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Johnsonville successfully recovers the contaminated product, completes its investigation into the foreign matter contamination source, implements corrective actions, and FSIS determines sufficient resolution has occurred to close the recall before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The recall was issued on April 5, 2025, meaning by July 1, 2025, it will have been 87 days (approximately 12.4 weeks or 2.9 months) since issuance. My research assistant's report indicates that similar Johnsonville recalls typically closed within 4-8 weeks, while broader Class I meat recalls of comparable size often close within 2-4 months. The July 1 deadline falls near the upper end of typical closure timelines at 2.9 months. Currently, only 34 days have passed since the recall, so we're still early in the process. The status quo is that the recall remains Active, and absent new information, this would continue. However, the historical data suggests meaningful probability of closure within this timeframe. The 22,000+ pound recall is moderate in size, and foreign matter contamination may be straightforward to address compared to biological hazards. Johnsonville, as an established company, likely has robust recall procedures. Against this, some plastic contamination recalls in 2024 remained open for extended periods, and the Tyson example took approximately 4 months. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the status quo is Active status; (2) we're at the outer edge of typical timelines; (3) some recalls extend beyond 4 months. My forecast is not lower because: (1) 87 days falls solidly within the 2-4 month typical range; (2) historical Johnsonville data suggests 4-8 week closures are common; (3) this gives 53 additional days for closure. I would update higher with evidence of rapid product recovery or investigation progress. I would update lower with news of complications, additional affected products, or slow progress.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Johnsonville LLC of cheddar bratwurst for foreign matter contamination issued April 5, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReal Simple: [Over 22,000 Pounds of a Popular Sausage Brand Recalled Due to Contamination](https://www.realsimple.com/sausage-recall-2025-11711268)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/johnsonville-llc-recalls-cheddar-bratwurst-product-due-possible-foreign-matter) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical data on similar FSIS recalls provides context for typical closure timelines.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
