    "review": "Both forecasters present materially new and persuasive evidence I hadn’t incorporated: (1) a late‑May “spree” reportedly exceeding two dozen grants with corroborating OPA activity, indicating operational capacity and momentum; (2) claims of a very large cumulative total in 2025, suggesting clemency is not a one‑off but an ongoing program; and (3) identifiable June timing hooks (Trump’s birthday, Juneteenth, late‑June SCOTUS decisions) that create natural focal points. I find the capacity/momentum argument especially compelling given the very low threshold (>2). I’m more cautious than their 70–80% range for two reasons: post‑blitz pauses are common for message control and vetting, and the month boundary creates a non‑trivial risk that a batch slips to early July. I also flag that a reference to a July convention is off-cycle for 2025, so that particular timing risk is weaker. Overall, their inputs justify a sizable upward revision from my prior base‑rate‑anchored view.",
    "rationale": "Updated view: The reported late‑May wave and active OPA pipeline meaningfully raise the base probability that at least some clemencies occur in June. Trump’s incentives (reward allies/constituencies, sustain narrative on DOJ overreach) and his pattern of acting in batches increase the chance that any June action exceeds the 3‑person threshold. Juneteenth and other June hooks further support timing. Countervailing risks remain: a deliberate pause after May’s blitz, bunching for a July 4 rollout, or slippage of announcements across the month boundary due to vetting or optics. Given the low bar and fresh evidence of capacity and cadence, I’m moving from 33% to 65%, acknowledging a meaningful but not dominant chance of a June lull or timing slip.",
