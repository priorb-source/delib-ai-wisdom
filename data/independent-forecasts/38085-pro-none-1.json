    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. According to a news report from April 28, 2025, exactly 14.0 million Florida residents were already under drought conditions. If this situation persists for the next month, the question will resolve as 'Yes'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The onset of Florida's summer wet season in June brings widespread and significant rainfall to the state's most populated areas. This alleviates the dry conditions, causing the number of residents in drought to fall below the 14.0 million threshold by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the start of the wet season, June rainfall is average or below-average, or is not concentrated in the most populous drought-stricken regions. The existing drought conditions therefore persist or worsen, keeping the number of affected residents at or above 14.0 million.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on two primary competing factors: the strong status quo and the onset of Florida's seasonal weather patterns. The most critical piece of information is that as of late April 2025, the number of residents in drought was already at the 14.0 million threshold. This establishes a strong anchor, as large-scale environmental conditions like drought have significant inertia and do not typically reverse rapidly without a major weather event. The primary factor pushing towards a 'No' resolution is seasonality. The forecast period, from late May to late June, marks the beginning of Florida's wet season, which reliably brings increased rainfall and is the state's main mechanism for drought relief. The core of the forecast is whether one month of seasonal rain is sufficient to counteract a drought severe enough to affect 14 million people. While possible, especially if an early tropical system impacts the state, it often takes sustained above-average rainfall to make a significant dent in an established drought. My probability of 60% reflects that the status quo is the more likely outcome. It is not higher because the start of the wet season provides a very real and substantial probability of improvement. It is not lower because the drought's existing severity and inertia make a rapid recovery in just one month less likely than the conditions persisting. I would increase my forecast's probability if long-range models for June predicted below-normal rainfall. Conversely, I would decrease the probability if a tropical system were forecast to impact Florida or if widespread, heavy rains were observed early in the month.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
