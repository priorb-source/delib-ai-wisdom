    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my evidence set: official White House confirmation, inclusion on participant lists as of June 3, heavy host-country security prep, pre-summit principals’ meetings, and strong historical precedent. Forecaster 3 usefully emphasizes the very short 12-day window to the event, which reduces the risk of plan changes. Forecaster 2 pushes higher to 98% on the grounds that only extraordinary shocks could prevent attendance; that’s a reasonable stance but may underweight Trump’s demonstrated willingness to cancel high-profile foreign trips late (e.g., 2018 Summit of the Americas, 2019 Poland, 2019 Davos) when domestic or crisis considerations arise. Neither introduces materially new facts beyond what I already considered, but their timing emphasis and base-rate framing slightly strengthen the case for a higher probability than my initial 90%.",
    "rationale": "Key positives remain: the White House has confirmed attendance; Trump appears on official participant lists; extensive Canadian security and airspace measures are set; U.S. economic principals have already participated in preparatory sessions; and the G7 carries a strong attendance norm—Trump himself attended all scheduled G7s during his prior term (2017–2019), with 2020 canceled for pandemic reasons. The summit’s potential lack of a joint communiqué reflects agenda management, not indications of a U.S. no-show. The main residual risks over the next ~12 days are exogenous shocks (health, major domestic crisis, security incident, severe weather/aircraft issues) or an abrupt strategic cancellation—events that are low probability but not negligible for this president given past behavior. We’re close enough to the event that these tail risks are limited, but not so close (e.g., wheels-up) to push into the very high 90s. I therefore update upward from 90% to reflect the short time horizon and convergent commitments, but I stay below Forecaster 2’s 98% to account for Trump’s non-trivial history of late travel reversals under pressure. Triggers to move higher: confirmed departure/arrival logistics (pool reports, Air Force One wheels up to Calgary), on-site bilateral schedules. Triggers to move lower: credible reports of health issues, a significant domestic emergency, or signals of substituting a surrogate/virtual participation.",
