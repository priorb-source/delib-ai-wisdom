    "review": "There is a critical factual conflict between the forecasters that must be resolved. Forecaster 2 claims 338Canada currently projects 188-196 Liberal seats with only 8 days until the election - if true, this would be decisive evidence strongly favoring Yes. However, this directly contradicts Forecaster 3's analysis citing Conservative leads since mid-2023 and Liberal polling well below majority levels. Additionally, Forecaster 2 states the election is 'approximately six months away' despite my research indicating 8 days remaining, suggesting possible confusion about timeline or data sources. Forecaster 3's analysis of structural factors (incumbency fatigue, regional challenges, Bloc/NDP competition) aligns with broader Canadian political context but assigns only 2% probability. The critical issue: my research assistant's report made no mention of Liberal majority projections on 338Canada. If the Liberals were truly projected at 188-196 seats one week before voting, this would be the dominant fact in any analysis. The absence of this information in the brief strongly suggests Forecaster 2's claim may be inaccurate or based on outdated/misinterpreted data. Forecaster 3's detailed treatment of Conservative strength and structural barriers is more consistent with recent Canadian polling trends.",
    "rationale": "The factual discrepancy requires careful weighing. While Forecaster 2 provides specific numbers that would be compelling if verified, several factors suggest skepticism: (1) the research brief's silence on Liberal majority projections when this would be the story, (2) the contradiction with Forecaster 3's assessment of sustained Conservative leads, (3) Forecaster 2's timeline confusion ('six months away' vs. 8 days), and (4) broader context of Liberal weakness after 10 years in power. However, I cannot entirely dismiss the possibility that recent polling shows unexpected Liberal strength, or that my initial analysis underweighted tail scenarios. Canadian elections have produced late swings (2011, 2015), and advance voting increases don't necessarily predict outcomes. My initial 12% may have been too anchored on the difficulty of achieving 172 seats without considering that if Liberals are competitive at all, seat efficiency in a multi-party system could push them over the threshold. Conversely, Forecaster 3's 2% seems too confident given genuine uncertainty 8 days out. Balancing these considerations: I update moderately upward to account for the chance Forecaster 2 has valid information I'm missing and to better reflect genuine uncertainty in the final week, but remain skeptical that Liberals are truly in strong majority territory.",
