    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters on the core tension: the historical unlikelihood of such a rapid polling shift (political inertia) versus the demonstrated volatility of modern UK politics. Forecaster 2's analysis aligns very closely with my own, reinforcing the initial 8% forecast by usefully quantifying the required polling swing (over 20 points) and identifying the potential for a 'natural ceiling' on Reform's support. Forecaster 3, despite arriving at a higher probability of 15%, provided the most compelling new argument against a 'Yes' outcome by highlighting that the resolution is based on a poll-of-polls. This smooths out individual poll outliers, making a sustained 4-point lead an even higher bar to clear. While Forecaster 3 places more weight on the potential for volatility to overcome these barriers, their reasoning doesn't present a novel mechanism for this to happen that justifies nearly doubling the probability. Overall, the arguments presented in the deliberation have strengthened my conviction in the 'No' case.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 8%. My initial reasoning, based on the principle of political inertia against a government less than a year old, remains intact. The other forecasters' arguments have largely reinforced this view. Forecaster 2's quantification of the required polling swing as being over 20 points in just two months effectively highlights the historical scale of the challenge. Furthermore, Forecaster 3's point that the resolution depends on Politico's poll-of-polls is crucial. This methodology smooths out outlier results, meaning Reform UK would need to consistently and significantly lead Labour across multiple polling agencies. This makes achieving the 4-point lead criterion substantially more difficult than it would be in a single poll. While I acknowledge the political vacuum on the right and Nigel Farage's campaigning ability, these factors were already part of my initial 8% calculation to account for tail risk. The deliberation has not introduced new evidence to suggest that a historic, unprecedented political realignment is more likely than I first assessed; in fact, the point about the poll-of-polls methodology strengthens the case for a 'No' resolution. Therefore, I remain confident that an 8% probability correctly balances the strong status quo against the small but non-zero chance of a political earthquake.",
