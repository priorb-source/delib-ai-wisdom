    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize anchoring on Morning Consult over domestic polls and highlight the tie-as-No and rounding risks, which increase the likelihood of a No outcome given how tightly clustered both leaders are around 60%. Forecaster 2 adds a clear expectation of flat-to-slightly-up Sheinbaum vs flat-to-down Milei, and both note MC’s tendency to rate Milei higher than many Argentine polls and Sheinbaum lower than Mexico’s domestic highs—useful calibration. The explicit point about MC rounding to whole percentages and the single-snapshot resolution risk is a meaningful nuance I underweighted. I find their reasoning broadly convincing and directionally consistent with my own, with a slight additional tilt against Yes due to rounding/tie risk and Sheinbaum’s early-term stability.",
    "rationale": "Baseline remains Milei 61 vs Sheinbaum 60 in late April MC, but with 6 weeks to go and both series sticky near 60, the most likely band is 59–62 for each. Given MC’s whole-number display and single-check resolution, the tie probability is nontrivial and resolves No. Fundamentals still favor Sheinbaum modestly (ongoing honeymoon, strong domestic approval prints) while Milei faces domestic headwinds despite disinflation and occasional policy wins. Even if MC tends to rate Milei higher than local polls, the marginal evidence since January is either flat or slightly negative for him and flat-to-slightly-positive for her. Net effect: the chance that Milei is strictly above Sheinbaum on the check date is below even. I’m nudging my prior 42% down a bit to reflect the rounding/tie asymmetry and the slightly more persuasive case for Sheinbaum holding 60–62 while Milei risks 59–61.",
