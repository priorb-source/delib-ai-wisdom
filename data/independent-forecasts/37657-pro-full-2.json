  "information": "A novel bat coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, has been identified and is part of the Merbecovirus family, which includes the MERS virus. Research published in the journal 'Cell' confirms that the virus can bind to human ACE2 receptors and infect human airway and organoid cultures in laboratory settings. However, studies also indicate that its cell-entry efficiency is significantly lower than that of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAs of May 16, 2025, no human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 have been reported by any major global health organizations, including the WHO, US CDC, ProMED, or GISAID. Post-COVID surveillance systems are in place in several countries, including China, Korea, and the U.S., which involve routine metagenomic sequencing of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases. To date, these surveillance efforts have not detected any signals of HKU5-CoV-2 in human populations.\n\nHistorically, of the approximately 50 novel bat coronaviruses described in scientific literature since 2000, only SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have produced confirmed human cases within a year of their first description. The rate of publicly reported accidental laboratory infections for such viruses is also low, estimated at approximately one per decade worldwide.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The virus's low cell-entry efficiency proves to be a significant barrier to natural human infection. No zoonotic spillover events or lab-related incidents occur. Enhanced global surveillance systems for respiratory illnesses continue to operate and do not detect any human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 before the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A zoonotic spillover event occurs where an individual in close contact with the host bat population becomes infected, and the case is detected by public health surveillance. Alternatively, a low-probability accidental laboratory exposure results in a researcher becoming infected, with the case being subsequently reported by a credible health organization.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the current status quo, key biological characteristics of the virus, and historical base rates. The most significant factor is that as of today, May 16, 2025, there are zero reported human cases, and only six weeks remain until the resolution date. This makes 'No' the strong prior. The research indicating that HKU5-CoV-2 has a 'significantly lower' cell-entry efficiency than SARS-CoV-2, despite its ability to bind to human ACE2 receptors, provides a strong biological reason for why a spillover is unlikely. Furthermore, active post-COVID surveillance systems that perform metagenomic sequencing on SARI cases have not detected any signals of this virus in human populations, suggesting it is not silently circulating. The historical base rate for novel bat coronaviruses causing human outbreaks is also very low. My forecast is not lower than 2% because the virus has demonstrated the capability to infect human cells in a lab setting, meaning a spillover or lab accident is not impossible, just highly improbable. My forecast is not higher because that would disregard the strong evidence of the virus's low entry efficiency, the very short time remaining, and the lack of any signals from current enhanced surveillance programs. I would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of unexplained pneumonia clusters in relevant regions or new research suggesting a mutation that enhances infectivity. I would decrease it as time passes without any such signals.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
