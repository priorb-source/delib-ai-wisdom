  "information": "In late May 2025, President Trump granted clemency to a large group of individuals. News outlets including The Hill and Politomix reported on May 28-29 that over two dozen people received pardons or commutations in what was described as a 'clemency spree' or 'blitz'. According to Office of the Pardon Attorney data, there were approximately 25 clemency actions in May. The recipients included political allies like former Congressman Michael Grimm and former Connecticut governor John G. Rowland, reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, and musicians such as NBA YoungBoy.\n\nSince taking office in January 2025, President Trump has granted approximately 1,600 pardons or commutations, a figure more than six times the total from his entire first term. A large portion of this number stems from a mass clemency order issued on his first day in office, which pardoned roughly 1,500 individuals convicted of offenses related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. The administration has installed key personnel to manage the process, including Ed Martin as the new pardon attorney at the Justice Department and Alice Marie Johnson as a White House pardon czar.\n\nDuring his first presidential term, Donald Trump did not grant any clemencies during the month of June in any of the four years. For his second term, a May 28, 2025, report from the Washington Times indicated that Trump has signaled more pardons could be forthcoming, including for two men convicted in the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. A White House official was also quoted stating the President has come to the aid of political supporters and donors and has expressed sympathy for allies caught in the judicial system.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until June 30, 2025, when June clemencies would be known/publicly disclosed).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — continued clemency activity into June, exceeding the low threshold of >2 individuals.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "After the late-May ‘clemency spree,’ the White House deliberately pauses in June (e.g., to manage backlash or re-time optics for early July), resulting in 0–2 publicly disclosed actions that month. Alternatively, processing bottlenecks or a communications choice to batch next decisions in July keep June totals at 2 or fewer.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration continues its current cadence with a small drip or another batch (e.g., additional political allies, high-profile cases like the Whitmer-plot convicts, or criminal-justice-themed actions tied to Juneteenth), easily taking the June total above two.",
    "rationale": "- What I’m weighing: The threshold is very low (>2), and the recent pattern and signaling point toward ongoing clemency activity. The counterpoint is month-to-month lumpiness after a late-May blitz that could create a temporary lull in June.\n\n- Key facts from the research assistant’s report influencing my view:\n  • In late May 2025, Trump granted clemency to over two dozen people in a ‘spree.’\n  • Since January 2025, he has granted on the order of ~1,600 pardons/commutations, driven by an inaugural-day mass action plus continued monthly activity.\n  • Personnel and process are in place (new pardon attorney; a White House clemency lead), suggesting capacity for ongoing throughput rather than one-off bursts.\n  • Reporting indicates more pardons could be forthcoming, including some specific cases under consideration.\n\n- Status quo weighting: The current cadence is high relative to Trump’s first term and relative to what would be needed to clear this threshold. Even if June is quieter than May, just three publicly disclosed actions would resolve this as Yes. A continuation of normal operations (even at a reduced pace) likely produces >2.\n\n- Why not higher than my forecast? Month-specific timing risk is real. Trump’s first term had no June clemencies (though the second term looks different), and after a late-May surge the team might intentionally pause or bunch the next tranche for early July (e.g., around July 4) or another news hook. There’s also a small risk that actions occur but are not publicly disclosed in June (the criterion requires public disclosure).\n\n- Why not lower? The administration has shown both appetite and infrastructure for frequent clemency. Public signaling suggests additional actions are in the pipeline. Given how low the bar is (>2), even a modest drip in June would suffice. Trump typically does not halt controversial actions solely due to negative press, reducing the likelihood of a complete June pause.\n\n- What would move me up: Credible reports/leaks of imminent June clemencies; early-June announcements; White House or DOJ/O-PA indications of a steady weekly cadence; hints of themed June actions (e.g., Juneteenth criminal-justice clemencies).\n\n- What would move me down: Clear White House guidance that the next batch is targeted for July; signals of an internal review or pause; evidence that late-May actions cleared the near-term docket; a shift in focus to other priorities (e.g., unexpected crises) that crowds out June announcements.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
