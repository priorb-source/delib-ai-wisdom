    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days (from April 22, 2025 to May 8, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Chris Stapleton wins at least one award",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite having 5 nominations, Chris Stapleton loses in all categories to other nominees. This could occur if there's a surprise sweep by another artist or if the competition is particularly strong across all his nominated categories, with voters splitting their support among other deserving artists.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Chris Stapleton wins at least one of his 5 nominated categories at the 60th ACM Awards. Given his multiple nominations and strong industry reputation, he converts at least one nomination into a win, which is typical for leading nominees with this many nods.",
    "rationale": "Chris Stapleton has 5 nominations at the 60th ACM Awards, giving him multiple opportunities to win. Historically, Stapleton has been one of the most successful and acclaimed country artists of the past decade at major country music awards. Having 5 nominations indicates strong industry support and recognition. Statistically, with 5 independent chances, even if each category had a modest 20-25% win probability, the cumulative probability of winning at least one award would be approximately 67-72% (calculated as 1 minus the probability of losing all five). However, Stapleton is not an average nominee - he's a consistently awarded artist, which likely pushes this higher. The research assistant notes he's also performing at the ceremony alongside Dua Lipa, suggesting he's a prominent figure at the event. Why not higher (85-90%): Awards can be unpredictable, and there's always the possibility of strong competition across all categories or a surprise sweep by another artist. No win is guaranteed. Why not lower (60-65%): Five nominations is substantial, and leading nominees with this many nods typically win at least one award. Stapleton's track record at country awards is very strong. For me to revise upward: Information about him being the frontrunner in specific major categories, or historical data showing 5-nomination artists win more than 80% of the time. For me to revise downward: Evidence of particularly strong competition in all his categories or reports of a potential sweep by another artist.",
