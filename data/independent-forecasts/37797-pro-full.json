  "information": "Following its plenary meeting in Paris from February 17-21, 2025, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) announced no changes to its 'black list' of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action, which continues to include North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar. During the same plenary, Laos and Nepal were added to the 'grey list' of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, while the Philippines was removed. The FATF also maintained the suspension of Russia's membership, which has been in place since February 2023, without adding the country to either the grey or black lists.\n\nIn February 2025, South Africa's National Treasury reported that the country had addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 FATF action items, with the remaining two expected to be resolved by June 2025. The goal is to facilitate an exit from the grey list by October 2025. In West Africa, a May 2025 meeting of the GIABA Ministerial Committee noted that Senegal had exited the FATF grey list in October 2024. However, four other regional members—Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Côte d'Ivoire—remain on the grey list, with Nigeria's government stating an aim to be removed by the end of May 2025.\n\nIndian government officials announced in May 2025 their intention to submit fresh intelligence to the FATF concerning terrorist infrastructure operating within Pakistan. This development follows Pakistan's removal from the FATF Grey List in October 2022. At the time of its removal, the FATF noted that Pakistan should continue working with the Asia Pacific Group (APG) to improve its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing systems. Separately, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also recently advised Pakistan to enhance its AML/CFT effectiveness.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month. The question will resolve following the FATF plenary in June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo is that the list of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action remains unchanged, containing only North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FATF concludes its June 2025 plenary and its 'black list' of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action remains unchanged, consisting of North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the June 2025 plenary, the FATF announces that a jurisdiction has been added to or removed from its 'black list'. For example, Russia could be added, or Myanmar could be removed.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant inertia inherent in the Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) listing process. Changes to the 'black list' are rare and represent major shifts in the international assessment of a country's financial system. The current members—North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar—are highly unlikely to be removed. North Korea and Iran have long-standing, systemic deficiencies. Myanmar was added relatively recently (October 2022) following a military coup, and the ongoing internal conflict makes the implementation of sufficient reforms improbable in this timeframe. The most plausible scenario for a 'Yes' outcome would be the addition of a new jurisdiction, with Russia being the primary candidate due to the war in Ukraine and its suspended membership status. However, the FATF has already held multiple plenaries since Russia's full-scale invasion without adding it to the black or grey lists, suggesting a lack of consensus and that membership suspension remains the political compromise. The February 2025 plenary, which made no changes to the black list, strongly reinforces this expectation of stability. While the risk of an addition due to a geopolitical shock is not zero, the high bar for consensus makes the status quo the most probable outcome. My probability is not higher because of this demonstrated institutional inertia and the high political threshold for change. My probability is not lower to account for the small but real chance of a major event forcing a policy shift, particularly regarding Russia.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"black list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Financial Action Task Force blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force_blacklist)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action\" list, which at the time of this question consists of North Korea, Myanmar and Iran.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
