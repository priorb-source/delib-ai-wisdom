    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises compelling arguments I underweighted: the diplomatic cost of declining Brazil's invitation is indeed substantial given Uruguay's economic dependence and Mercosur ties, and the distinction between attending as a guest versus seeking membership significantly reduces the commitment level and geopolitical risk. The Frente Amplio-Lula ideological alignment is also relevant. However, 80% seems overconfident given the actual status quo - no announcement in three months with only 26 days remaining.\n\nForecaster 3 makes the most nuanced analysis, particularly emphasizing the critical distinction between announcement timing and actual attendance. The observation that governments routinely announce head-of-state travel close to event dates is important and something I underweighted. The possibility of sending a foreign minister instead of the president, or an announcement slipping into early July (after resolution), are real risks that Forecaster 2 doesn't adequately address. The 52% forecast appropriately balances these competing factors.\n\nBoth forecasters correctly identify that I was likely too pessimistic at 28%. The diplomatic incentives are stronger than I initially weighted, and late announcements are more normal than I considered. However, I still find the three-month silence more concerning than Forecaster 3 does.",
    "rationale": "Updating my analysis: I now give more weight to (1) the diplomatic pressure from Brazil being a major neighbor and partner, making a snub costly; (2) the low-commitment nature of guest attendance not requiring ideological alignment; (3) the normalcy of governments announcing travel schedules relatively close to dates; and (4) the Frente Amplio's natural alignment with Lula's politics. These factors suggest higher probability than my initial 28%.\n\nHowever, I remain more cautious than Forecaster 3 because: (1) three months of complete silence since March suggests genuine hesitation or internal debate; (2) with only 26 days until resolution, time pressure is real; (3) the question hinges on announcement by June 30, not actual attendance - a July 2-3 announcement would resolve as No; (4) Uruguay could send the foreign minister instead; (5) Uruguay's historical non-alignment tradition creates genuine political constraints.\n\nThe key insight is that while diplomatic incentives favor eventual attendance, the timing requirement and status quo evidence of prolonged indecision create meaningful downside risk. I'm moving significantly upward from 28% but staying below 52% because the prolonged silence is a stronger negative signal than Forecaster 3 weights it.",
