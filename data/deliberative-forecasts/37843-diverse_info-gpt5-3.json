    "review": "- Forecaster 2 convincingly emphasizes the credibility of the March banker-mandate reports and Discord’s long-term independence ambitions. However, they underweight the resolution constraint: only a public S-1 or a specific Discord blog announcement counts. Many companies advance IPO prep without making either move on a five-week horizon, especially if they can keep a confidential filing. Given that, 60% seems too high for this narrow, time-bounded trigger.\n- Forecaster 3’s analysis aligns closely with mine: the elapsed time since the March reports without action through the specified channels, plus typical issuer behavior, points to a No by default. They appropriately stress the strict resolution criteria. One potential gap is that some issuers do announce a confidential submission via press release/blog, which is a real path to Yes; still, that’s not the norm.\n- No new hard evidence was introduced beyond the March media reports; the arguments mostly reweight known facts. I find F3’s reasoning more persuasive than F2’s for this specific resolution window.",
    "rationale": "My base view already incorporated: (1) credible reporting of a 2025 IPO with top-tier banks, (2) a short remaining window, and (3) the requirement for a public S-1 or a specific blog post. The most plausible Yes paths are either a late-June public S-1 aimed at a fall pricing or a brief blog post acknowledging a confidential submission. Both are plausible but not the base case.\nCountervailing factors: issuers often avoid early public filings to preserve optionality; the mixed market backdrop raises the value of waiting; and the ~5–6 week runway is tight. The lack of any formal move since March modestly tilts further toward No. Given that the other forecasters did not add concrete new catalysts, I see no basis to raise my probability. I’m holding at 38%, with upside if we see credible chatter of imminent filing or a market snapback, and downside if tech markets weaken further or there are signals of a deferral to later in 2025/2026.",
