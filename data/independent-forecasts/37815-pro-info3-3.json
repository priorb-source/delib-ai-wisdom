  "information": "A number of high-profile encounters between military aircraft and UAPs have been reported in North America. In an incident on January 19, 2023, a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet collided with an unidentified object during a training mission over Arizona, cracking the aircraft's canopy. This event was one of 22 UAP sightings reported by Air Force pilots between October 2022 and June 2023. Arizona, particularly near military training zones, is described as a hotspot for such sightings. Some U.S. officials have suggested these objects may be advanced drones. In a separate event on September 17, 2024, an Air Force pilot reported a close encounter with a dark grey, football-sized cylindrical object over California.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes without any pilot reports of UFOs/UAPs from a South American country being posted to the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database. This is the most likely outcome due to the historical rarity of such specific reports.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial, military, or private pilot flying in South America during June 2025 observes an anomalous object. The pilot or an associate submits a report of the encounter to NUFORC, which is then vetted and published on their website before the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is primarily based on the low historical frequency of qualifying events. The question requires a conjunction of several specific criteria: a report from a pilot, an observation in South America, an occurrence in June 2025, and being posted on the NUFORC database. An analysis of the NUFORC database shows that reports from South America are infrequent compared to North America, and reports specifically from pilots represent a small fraction of all sightings. The estimated base rate for a qualifying report is significantly less than one per month, suggesting a high probability of zero such events in any given month. The research assistant's report, focusing on North American military encounters, reinforces the concentration of reported activity in the US and provides no evidence to suggest an increase in South American reports. \n\nMy probability is not higher because there are no indicators of an impending increase in UAP activity or reporting from South America. The general global interest in UAPs has not yet translated into a sustained increase in high-quality pilot reports from this region making their way to this specific US-based database. \n\nMy probability is not lower because such events, while rare, are not impossible and have occurred in the past. A single qualifying report is all that is needed. Given the vast amount of air traffic and heightened global awareness, the possibility of a report emerging remains. I would increase my forecast if a credible UAP sighting wave were to begin in South America just before or during June 2025. I would decrease it if major, prolonged disruptions to air travel occurred over the continent.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in South America in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) a sighting in Brazil in December 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the South American continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA number of high-profile encounters between military aircraft and UAPs have been reported in North America.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
