  "information": "Tourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands grew significantly in 2024, with the islands welcoming nearly two million visitors across air and cruise travel. This total represents a 10.66% increase in air arrivals and a 30.48% increase in cruise passengers compared to the previous year. New airline routes have been added to accommodate the demand, including a nonstop American Airlines service from Miami to South Caicos launched in March 2025. Concurrently, the U.S. Department of State maintains a Level 2 \"exercise increased caution\" travel advisory for TCI, first issued in July 2023, citing crime levels and reminding travelers of the islands' strict laws against firearms and ammunition.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Uber is not currently available in Turks and Caicos and authorities are actively discouraging “Uber-like”/unlicensed services.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The government maintains its stance against ride-hailing and unlicensed taxis, continues enforcement, and no Uber listing appears for Turks and Caicos on Uber’s website. Transport for visitors remains via licensed taxis, hotel shuttles, and car rentals; any “Uber” references remain to informal or illegal operators.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Authorities announce or quietly permit a regulated e-hailing pilot that integrates licensed taxis, or Uber launches a limited product (e.g., Uber Taxi/Uber Reserve with licensed operators, or a seasonal niche service like Uber Boat) and updates its website to list Turks and Caicos. Local media and/or an Uber press release confirm availability before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and policy signals: The cited warning to tourism stakeholders about “illegal taxis” indicates active enforcement and a restrictive stance toward ride‑hailing. In small island jurisdictions, such advisories typically precede or accompany crackdowns rather than liberalization. With only ~60 days left, a policy reversal plus driver onboarding and a visible Uber website update is unlikely. \n- Base rates in the region: Uber often faces regulatory resistance in smaller Caribbean islands; several comparable markets have either no Uber presence or had contentious rollouts. Turks and Caicos has a small resident population and a powerful taxi sector, raising the bar for entry. \n- Timing/operational cadence: Uber launches are usually telegraphed weeks in advance with driver recruitment and local PR. There are no visible public signals of an imminent launch. \n- Demand-side considerations: Tourism is booming (per the assistant’s note: 2024 saw strong growth and new air routes in 2025), which supports the idea that ride‑hailing could be useful. This is the main reason the probability is not near zero. If anything launches, the most plausible near-term path is an Uber Taxi/Reserve model partnering with licensed operators, or a narrowly scoped seasonal product (e.g., a boat offering). \n- Why not higher: Strong recent enforcement posture against illegal taxis; short timeline; small market; lack of preparatory signals from Uber or the government. \n- Why not lower: Tourism growth creates a clear demand case; Uber has experimented with niche/seasonal offerings in tourist locales; a regulated taxi-integration pilot could be arranged relatively quickly if politically desired. \n- What would move me upward: An official government statement about enabling e-hailing; reports of driver onboarding for a taxi-integration pilot; an Uber press release or app/website listing; credible local media reports of an imminent launch. \n- What would move me downward: Continued enforcement announcements, explicit statements that ride‑hailing will remain prohibited through peak season, or absence of any launch chatter by mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Uber be available in the Turks and Caicos Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tourism Stakeholders Warned About Encouraging Use of Illegal Taxis](https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/tourism-stakeholders-warned-about-encouraging-use-of-illegal-taxis/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Uber is available in Turks and Caicos as shown on the [Uber website](https://www.uber.com/us/en/search-results/?query=TURKS+AND+CAICOS) or according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nTourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands grew significantly in 2024, with the islands welcoming nearly two million visitors across air and cruise travel.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
