  "information": "According to a March 25, 2025 report, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) denied reports of plans to suspend Starlink's satellite broadband service. The TRCSL Director General stated that a 'dashboard system' is required to regulate the service and that its implementation had been delayed. The Director General mentioned that the service was expected to become operational in April 2025 once the necessary systems were in place.\n\nA separate report from March 23, 2025, stated that the Sri Lankan government had put Starlink services on hold until the company guarantees government agencies the right to intercept data or communication details for national security reasons. According to the Deputy Minister of Information Technology, discussions between the Defence Ministry, TRCSL, and Starlink were still at a preliminary stage. The report also noted that the TRCSL had already approved tariff plans for Starlink services.\n\nReports from late April and early May 2025 provide context on Starlink's expansion in the region. Bangladesh's telecommunication regulator granted Starlink two 10-year operating licenses, making it the second South Asian country after Sri Lanka to approve the service. Officials indicated that Starlink was preparing to launch service in Bangladesh by May 2025. In contrast, Starlink's full license in Pakistan is delayed pending permanent registration and the clearance of technical and security checks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 45 days, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Starlink availability map currently shows Sri Lanka as 'Coming Soon'. The service launch, previously anticipated for April 2025, is delayed pending the resolution of regulatory and national security requirements.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing discussions between Starlink and the Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence regarding national security access and data interception fail to reach a conclusion. The implementation of a required 'dashboard system' for regulation faces further technical or bureaucratic delays, pushing the operational launch past the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Recognizing the economic and technological benefits, the Sri Lankan government fast-tracks the final approvals. A compromise on the security and regulatory framework is reached in late May or early June, and Starlink, leveraging its regional deployment capabilities, quickly activates the service and updates its availability map to show Sri Lanka as 'Available'.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on recent reports indicating significant delays despite earlier approvals. While Starlink received a license from Sri Lanka in August 2024, more recent information from March 2025 reveals critical roadblocks. The primary obstacle is the government's demand for security agencies to have data interception capabilities, a complex issue where discussions were still at a 'preliminary stage' as of late March. This type of security negotiation is often protracted, as seen with Starlink's delays in Pakistan.\n\nThe strongest piece of evidence supporting a delay is the fact that the TRCSL Director General's stated expectation of an April 2025 launch has already passed. This missed deadline signals that the existing hurdles are not trivial and that the timeline is uncertain. With only about 45 days remaining, resolving sensitive national security concerns, implementing a new regulatory 'dashboard system', and completing the operational rollout is a challenging task.\n\nThe probability is not lower than 35% because there is still a clear intent from both parties to launch the service, evidenced by the initial license and the approval of tariff plans. Political will could potentially expedite a resolution. Starlink's recent successful launch in Bangladesh demonstrates its ability to move quickly once regulatory hurdles are cleared. \n\nThe probability is not higher than 35% because the status quo is one of delay, and the national security issue is a fundamental disagreement, not a minor detail. The short timeframe provides little buffer for further negotiation or implementation delays.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon news of a signed agreement between Starlink and the Sri Lankan Defence Ministry. Conversely, I would decrease it if reports emerge that talks have stalled or if the end of June approaches with no resolution.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
