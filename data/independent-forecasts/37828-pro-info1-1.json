  "information": "In May 2025, HR tech firm Rippling raised $450 million in a Series G funding round, which increased its valuation to $16.8 billion. As part of this event, the company also committed to a tender offer to repurchase up to $200 million in equity from current and former employees. Reports indicate Rippling has surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue and doubled it to over $350 million by the end of 2023. The company serves over 20,000 customers and the new funds are intended for enhancing its workforce management products and expanding global revenue.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Rippling remains a private company and does not announce an IPO before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rippling's management and board decide to use the recently raised $450 million in venture capital to fuel further product development and international expansion. They will focus on executing their growth strategy over the next 12-24 months, delaying any IPO considerations until they achieve further scale and the market conditions are more favorable.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recent Series G funding round was a strategic 'crossover' round to set a valuation floor and de-risk the process ahead of a surprise, accelerated IPO. An exceptionally positive shift in the market for tech IPOs prompts Rippling's board to seize the opportunity, and they file an S-1 or make an official announcement before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards a 'No' outcome, primarily due to Rippling's recent corporate actions. The company just raised a $450 million Series G in May 2025. Typically, a large, late-stage funding round like this provides a company with a significant cash runway (often 18-24 months) to pursue growth initiatives, precisely to *delay* the need to go public. The stated use of funds for product enhancement and global expansion supports this long-term private growth narrative. Furthermore, the accompanying $200 million tender offer provides liquidity to employees and early investors, which also serves to reduce the internal pressure for an IPO. The timeframe for this question is extremely short—less than six weeks. It is highly unconventional for a company to close a major private funding round and then immediately announce an IPO within such a compressed period.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because the possibility of a 'dual-track' process, where a company explores both a private funding round and an IPO simultaneously, cannot be entirely ruled out. It is plausible, though unlikely, that the S-1 is largely prepared and the company is waiting for an optimal market window, which could theoretically open before the deadline.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 5% because the evidence overwhelmingly points away from an imminent IPO. The capital raise and employee tender offer are strong signals that Rippling is fortifying its position as a private entity for the medium term. An IPO announcement so soon after would contradict the strategic rationale for these actions.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged from sources like Bloomberg or The Information that Rippling had confidentially filed its S-1 or had formally engaged investment banks for an IPO planned for 2025. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if the CEO or another top executive made public statements explicitly ruling out an IPO in the near term.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Rippling announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Startup News: Shares of HR firm Rippling gain value as its business expands](https://forgeglobal.com/insights/blog/startup-news-shares-of-rippling-gain-value-as-its-business-expands/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Rippling, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.rippling.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn May 2025, HR tech firm Rippling raised $450 million in a Series G funding round, which increased its valuation to $16.8 billion.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
