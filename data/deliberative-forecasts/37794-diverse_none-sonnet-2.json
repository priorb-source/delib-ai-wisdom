    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a critical point I underweighted: historical precedent. The specific examples of Chipper Jones (2008) and Luis Arraez (2023) being at .400 on June 1 suggest this is not as rare as I initially estimated. If this has happened twice in ~17 years, the base rate alone is around 10-12%, and we're starting with an active candidate, not from zero. However, their 40% forecast seems too optimistic given the powerful force of regression to the mean over 40-50 additional at-bats.\n\nForecaster 3's qualification threshold concern is important and something I hadn't fully considered. If ESPN's default view only shows qualified batters, a player near the PA minimum could drop off the page due to rest/injury. However, most players reaching .400 by mid-May are everyday players with robust playing time, making this scenario less likely but not negligible.\n\nThe most compelling argument is that we know someone is currently at/near .400 with only 13 days remaining. This transforms the question from 'will anyone reach .400' to 'can someone maintain .400 for ~10-12 more games,' which is a meaningfully higher probability scenario.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I believe I was too conservative at 10%. The historical examples provided by Forecaster 2 demonstrate that players have maintained .400+ through June 1 in recent memory more frequently than I initially credited. With someone (likely Judge) currently at this threshold and only 13 days remaining, the probability should be higher than the bare base rate.\n\nHowever, I still find Forecaster 2's 40% too high. Maintaining .400 requires essentially hitting .400 or better over the next 40-50 at-bats, which is extremely difficult even for elite hitters. The historical examples show it CAN happen, but it's still uncommon - perhaps 2-3 times per decade.\n\nThe qualification issue raised by Forecaster 3 adds a small but real downside risk. While unlikely for an everyday player, it's a valid consideration.\n\nBalancing these factors: the strong historical precedent and active candidate argue for moving significantly higher from 10%, but regression to the mean and the qualification risk argue against going as high as 40%. I'm updating to 20%, which reflects a roughly 1-in-5 chance that the current .400 hitter (or another player) maintains this level through June 1.",
