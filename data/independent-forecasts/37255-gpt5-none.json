    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Libya does not complete ratification and deposit of instruments before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Libya’s divided institutions (executive in Tripoli, HoR legislature in Tobruk) do not prioritize AfCFTA. No parliamentary ratification vote is scheduled or held, or administrative steps to deposit instruments with the AU are not completed by end of June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A political window opens: the competent Libyan authority fast-tracks approval (e.g., HoR passes the ratification law swiftly), and the government promptly deposits the instrument of ratification with the AU before July 1, possibly timed with AU mid‑year meetings or an AfCFTA event.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the status quo is sticky. Libya has not yet ratified AfCFTA, and ratification typically requires legislative approval plus formal deposit with the AU—steps that often take weeks to months even after a vote. Libya’s political fragmentation and legislative gridlock further lower near‑term odds. Libya’s economy is hydrocarbon‑centric and AfCFTA has not appeared to be a top‑tier policy priority, which aligns with prolonged non‑ratification since the agreement opened in 2018.\n\nThere is some non‑zero chance of a sudden move: AU or AfCFTA‑related milestones in June can spur symbolic ratifications, and executives sometimes push treaties through quickly if there’s a diplomatic payoff. If Libya had already signed but not ratified, that path is somewhat easier; if Libya hasn’t even signed, doing both steps before July would be even harder. Either way, absent concrete reporting of a scheduled vote or cabinet action, the base rate for a late‑adopter ratifying within a two‑month window is low.\n\nWhy not higher: no public indications of imminent legislative action, administrative and deposit steps take time, and Libya’s institutional divides make coordination harder. Why not lower: occasional rapid ratifications do happen, and diplomatic timing (e.g., AU mid‑year coordination meetings) could provide impetus.\n\nWhat would move me up: credible reports of (1) the HoR placing AfCFTA ratification on its agenda with a specific vote date, (2) cabinet approval accompanied by statements from the Ministry of Economy/Foreign Affairs on imminent deposit, or (3) AU/AfCFTA Secretariat notes that Libya has completed domestic procedures awaiting deposit. What would move me down: signs of escalated domestic political crisis curtailing legislative sessions, or official indications that treaty matters are deferred beyond mid‑year. The research assistant provided no additional info, reinforcing reliance on base rates and institutional context.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Libya ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [African Continental Free Trade Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Continental_Free_Trade_Area)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Libya ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
