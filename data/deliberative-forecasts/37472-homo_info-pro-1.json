    "review": "Forecaster 2 introduces a critical piece of information I had not considered: the return of Sheikh Hasina's political rival, Khaleda Zia, on May 6, 2025. This argument is highly convincing, as it fundamentally changes the political calculus from one of pure self-preservation for Hasina to one of political survival. The risk of becoming irrelevant now directly counters the risk of arrest. Forecaster 3 provides a solid and convincing analysis of the diplomatic and legal hurdles of extradition, reinforcing my initial belief that a forced return is highly unlikely within the timeframe. However, their forecast appears to under-weigh the immense political pressure for a voluntary return created by Zia's presence in Bangladesh.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 10% was primarily based on the severe and near-certain legal jeopardy Sheikh Hasina would face upon returning to Bangladesh, leading me to conclude that a rational actor would remain in exile. The deliberation, particularly Forecaster 2's analysis, has convinced me that I under-weighted the political factors. The recent return of Khaleda Zia creates a new, powerful incentive for Hasina to make a high-risk return to maintain her political relevance and leadership of the Awami League. The long-term risk of political oblivion now competes directly with the short-term risk of imprisonment. While Forecaster 3's points about the unlikelihood of a swift extradition remain valid, the probability of a voluntary, politically motivated return has substantially increased. Therefore, I am updating my forecast upward to reflect this new dynamic. I am not raising it as high as 40% because I still believe the certainty of arrest and prosecution upon arrival is an extremely powerful deterrent that Hasina cannot ignore. My updated forecast balances these two opposing, high-stakes risks.",
