    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5–6 weeks (the April 2025 trade report is typically released in early June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Exports come in roughly flat year over year, hovering around the April 2024 level (~$262.6B), making the result a near coin-flip around the threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A strong US dollar and soft external demand weigh on goods shipments; any retaliation chatter around new US tariffs prompts some foreign buyers to delay orders; aircraft exports underperform and petroleum export values ease in April, keeping total exports at or below $262.6B.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Services exports (especially travel and business services) continue to recover, petroleum export values are supported by elevated oil prices, and selected capital goods (including aircraft and industrial machinery) see solid deliveries, pushing total exports modestly above $262.6B.",
    "rationale": "Baseline pressures are mixed. On the supportive side, services exports have been on a multi‑year recovery path (travel and other services demand normalizing), and oil prices have been relatively elevated, which tends to bolster nominal petroleum export values. Global manufacturing indicators have shown tentative improvement, which would modestly aid goods exports. On the headwind side, the US dollar has been strong, which generally dampens price competitiveness for US goods abroad, and policy uncertainty around new US tariffs could elicit caution or nascent retaliation that trims orders at the margin. April is not seasonally extreme, so a modest year‑over‑year nominal drift is the base case. The threshold (262.578B) is close to a typical monthly level, so the outcome is likely to be decided by small moves in petroleum values, aircraft deliveries, and travel receipts. I place slightly more weight on a small nominal rise than a decline, given services momentum and commodity price support, but keep the edge modest because dollar strength and policy risk could easily offset. Research assistant provided no additional information, so this forecast leans on base rates and current macro themes rather than new hard data. Why not higher: dollar strength, potential trade frictions, and uneven goods demand argue against confidently beating last April. Why not lower: services recovery and firmer energy prices provide a cushion. What would move me up: signs of strong April travel receipts, robust aircraft/industrial shipments, or higher petroleum export values. What would move me down: notable April softness in export price indexes, reports of delayed shipments, or a clear strengthening in the dollar late in April.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US exports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of exports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 262,578 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
