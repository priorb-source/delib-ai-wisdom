    "review": "My initial forecast was 15%. I am deliberating with two forecasters at 28% and 12%. I find Forecaster 3's (12%) reasoning most convincing and aligned with my own, but they added a crucial piece of logic I had undervalued. Forecaster 3 rightly emphasized that John Morgan's stated preference for a \"brief, three-month campaign\" is fundamentally at odds with an announcement before July 1, 2025, which would initiate a 17-month marathon. This is a powerful argument for a later entry. Forecaster 2 (28%) argues that recent candidate announcements fulfill Morgan's desire to \"observe the field\" and could accelerate his decision. I find this less compelling; it is more likely that these new entries will prompt a longer period of polling and analysis, pushing any decision well past the short deadline. The contradiction between Morgan's stated strategy and the timeline for a 'Yes' resolution, as highlighted by Forecaster 3, is the most impactful point from the deliberation.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 15% to 10%. My initial reasoning rested on Morgan's strong base rate of not running despite public flirtations (2018, 2022) and his recent statement that he would wait to observe the developing field. The deliberation phase, particularly with Forecaster 3, sharpened a key point: Morgan's own stated preference for a \"brief, three-month campaign\" directly contradicts the premise of a June 2025 announcement. Announcing now would begin a long, 17-month campaign, the very thing he seems to want to avoid. This makes an imminent announcement not just unlikely based on his past behavior, but also strategically incoherent with his own public statements. While his concurrent work on a new political party indicates serious political engagement and prevents the probability from being lower, this strategic contradiction provides a strong reason to be more confident in a 'No' outcome before the July 1 deadline.",
