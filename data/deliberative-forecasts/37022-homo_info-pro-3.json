    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two fellow forecasters. Forecaster 3's analysis is highly convincing and aligns perfectly with my own initial assessment. We both correctly identified that Ukraine's government debt has been multiple trillions of UAH for a significant time, making the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold a very low bar. Forecaster 3 added valuable detail by citing specific financing tranches from the IMF and EU in March 2025, which strengthens the already overwhelming case for a 'Yes' resolution. In contrast, Forecaster 2's analysis appears to be based on a fundamental misreading of the data. Their premise that the debt was 1.869 trillion UAH in February 2025 is factually incorrect by a factor of more than three. All official data from the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine and the specified source (Trading Economics) show the debt was well over 5 trillion UAH at that time. While their analytical method of comparing median increases to historical frequency would be interesting if the premise were correct, it is entirely irrelevant given the actual scale of the debt. Therefore, their reasoning is not persuasive.",
    "rationale": "I am not changing my forecast of 99%. My initial reasoning was that Ukraine's government debt at the start of 2025 was already approximately 3.7 times higher than the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold, and the country's wartime fiscal situation makes a massive debt reduction impossible. The analysis from Forecaster 3 reinforces this conclusion by providing specific evidence of new debt being incurred in March 2025 through loans from the IMF and EU. This confirms that the debt not only remained above the threshold but actively increased during the month in question. The analysis from Forecaster 2 was disregarded as it was built on a demonstrably false premise about the debt level. My forecast remains at 99% rather than 100% simply to account for the very small, residual possibility of a major data reporting error or a large, retroactive data revision by the source, which is an uncertainty that the new information does not eliminate.",
