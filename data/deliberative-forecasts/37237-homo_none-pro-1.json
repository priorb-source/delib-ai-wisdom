    "review": "All three forecasters identified the same core dynamic: a strong baseline tendency for nominal year-over-year import growth driven by inflation and real GDP, versus two primary downside risks—a significant economic slowdown and a major shift in trade policy (i.e., new tariffs). The divergence in our forecasts stems from the different weights assigned to these downside risks. The other forecasters' higher confidence prompted me to re-examine the impact of potential tariffs. I had not fully considered that the initial effect of broad tariffs could be an *increase* in the nominal value of imports, as higher prices (the price effect) might outweigh the immediate reduction in import volumes (the volume effect), especially if demand is inelastic in the short term. This insight, which was implicit in their higher confidence, makes the tariff scenario less of a clear pathway to a 'No' outcome than I had initially assumed.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 65% was based on the view that the risk of new, disruptive tariffs represented a substantial threat to nominal import growth. However, after considering the other analysts' perspectives, I believe I overweighting this risk's potential to cause a year-over-year decline in the *nominal* value. The price effect of tariffs could paradoxically inflate the total import value in the short run. This means the primary risk that could realistically cause a 'No' outcome is a genuine economic recession leading to a significant drop in import demand. While a recession remains a non-trivial risk, it is not the baseline forecast. The combined tailwinds of persistent inflation and modest economic growth create a strong default path toward a nominal increase. Therefore, the probability of a 'Yes' outcome is higher than I first estimated. I am increasing my forecast from 65% to 75%, placing me between the other two forecasters, reflecting a greater appreciation for the resilience of nominal growth while still acknowledging the significant policy and economic uncertainty.",
