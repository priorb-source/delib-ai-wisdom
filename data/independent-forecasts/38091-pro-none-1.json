    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be determined by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Based on the recent rate of about one new signatory per month, the status quo suggests this trend will continue.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The month of June 2025 passes with no new country formally signing the Accords. This could happen due to normal diplomatic delays, scheduling conflicts for a signing ceremony, or a temporary lull in the US State Department's campaign to recruit new members.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A country, not among the current 55 signatories, completes its diplomatic process and holds a signing ceremony with US officials in June 2025. The US State Department then issues a press release officially welcoming the new member.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the recent, steady rate of new signatories to the Artemis Accords. There have been two new signatories in the last two months: Bangladesh on April 8, 2025, and Norway on May 15, 2025. This establishes a clear trend of approximately one new country joining per month. This momentum is the result of a concerted diplomatic effort by the United States to build a broad coalition for its space exploration principles, and there is no information to suggest this effort is slowing down. The status quo is not a static list of members, but rather a dynamic process of expansion. Therefore, it is more likely than not that this established monthly pace will continue through June.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the exact timing of diplomatic agreements is inherently uncertain. A country that is on the verge of signing could face unforeseen internal political hurdles or simple bureaucratic delays, pushing the official signing from late June into early July, which would cause this question to resolve as No. A one-month period without a signing is a plausible random variation in the overall trend.\n\nMy probability is not lower because that would imply a belief that the recent, demonstrated trend is likely to halt abruptly. With a large pool of non-signatory nations and a clear, ongoing US diplomatic push, a sudden stop is the less likely outcome. The two signings in the immediate preceding months provide a strong evidentiary basis for expecting another one soon.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were public statements from US officials or a specific country's government indicating that a signing was planned for June. I would decrease my forecast if key US diplomatic personnel were diverted to other urgent matters, or if a likely candidate country announced it was delaying its decision.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025. There are 55 signatories at the time of this question: Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay. [(source)](https://www.state.gov/bureau-of-oceans-and-international-environmental-and-scientific-affairs/artemis-accords)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country becomes an Artemis Accord signatory after May 30, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
