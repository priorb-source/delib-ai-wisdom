    "review": "Both forecasters make solid status-quo and time-horizon arguments. New points I hadn’t explicitly cited: (1) EU appetite is near-zero to revive NS2 and is moving toward more sanctions; (2) NS2 AG’s insolvency/banking constraints in Switzerland/Germany reduce incentives to delist; (3) one string remains damaged, further minimizing practical upside. These all reinforce a No outcome. However, neither forecaster incorporated the May 2 on-record denial by Sec. Rubio or the reporting (May 5) that the President is weighing a bill to massively tighten energy-related measures (500% tariffs and expanded sanctions). Those developments materially cut the odds of an imminent delisting. Given those hawkish signals and the short runway, I find their 15% a bit high.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~8 weeks. High-salience Russia sanctions rarely flip without a major trigger. \n- Political signals: Sec. Rubio’s “unequivocally false” denial of lifting NS2 sanctions and reporting that the White House is entertaining far harsher energy measures both point away from delisting before July 1. \n- External environment: EU disinterest in NS2, ongoing war, and potential new EU sanctions make unilateral U.S. delisting politically costly. \n- Practical payoff: NS2 is damaged and the company is in insolvency proceedings; delisting yields little tangible benefit, increasing the hurdle for action. \n- Process: OFAC can move quickly but typically delists with clear rationale or in a broader policy package—no such groundwork is visible. \n- Tail risks: A sudden diplomatic package or a technical/legal delisting due to corporate status changes is possible but unlikely in this timeframe. \nNet: Peer arguments strengthen the No case; the newer hawkish U.S. signals further depress the odds. I keep my forecast low and unchanged.",
