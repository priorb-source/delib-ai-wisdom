    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my baseline: elections are not held under martial law; the Verkhovna Rada sets the date; and the remaining ~6 weeks make a pivot unlikely. Forecaster 2 adds emphasis on Rada action followed by CEC administration and notes a tail scenario of an announcement as a political signal—points I considered but they articulate the institutional sequence well. Forecaster 3 highlights that announcing a date typically implies initiating an election process and would likely entail public parliamentary debate—this strengthens the argument that we’d see visible precursors before July 1 if a Yes were coming. I find their reasoning convincing and consistent with observed practice. The added stress on the Rada’s role and the visibility/timing of parliamentary action nudges me slightly lower.",
    "rationale": "Status quo strongly favors No: martial law remains, international partners have accepted postponement, and Kyiv has prioritized security and governance continuity. A Yes requires either (1) credible movement to lift or significantly suspend martial law plus rapid parliamentary scheduling, or (2) a political decision to pre-commit to a future date despite uncertainty. With ~46 days left and no visible legislative or legal preparatory steps (e.g., draft bills, coalition signals, CEC coordination), the runway is very short. Forecaster 3’s point that setting a date typically initiates a public process makes a quiet, last-minute move even less likely. A small tail risk persists that Kyiv announces a contingent date to address legitimacy optics or in response to allied pressure, but that would still likely be telegraphed through Rada activity first. Given these considerations, I trim my estimate modestly from 10% to 8%.",
