  "information": "The recent rise in jobless claims was not uniform across the country. The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending May 31 were in Michigan, Nebraska, California, Florida, and Virginia. The largest decreases were reported in Massachusetts, Illinois, Texas, Washington, and New York. Several major corporations have announced layoffs in 2025, including Procter & Gamble, Microsoft, Citigroup, Walmart, Meta, and Disney.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks. The data for the week ending June 21, 2025, is scheduled for release on Thursday, June 26, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Recent jobless claims data has been trending upwards and hovering just above the 220,000 mark. Continuing this recent trend without any significant economic shifts would result in the number exceeding 220,000.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recent increase in claims proves to be a temporary spike. Stronger-than-expected seasonal hiring kicks in, and the decreases in claims reported in states like Texas and New York accelerate, offsetting the increases elsewhere. The announced corporate layoffs are either absorbed quickly by a resilient labor market or their impact is delayed, causing the figure for this specific week to dip below 220,000.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recent upward trend in jobless claims continues, reflecting a broader cooling of the labor market. The announced layoffs from major corporations like Microsoft, Citigroup, and Walmart materialize in the official data, pushing the weekly number further above the 220,000 threshold. The increases seen in large states like California and Michigan persist and are not fully offset by decreases elsewhere.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the convergence of recent quantitative data and forward-looking qualitative indicators. The status quo is the most influential factor; recent initial jobless claims figures have been volatile but have established a new, higher baseline around the 220,000-230,000 level. Given that the world changes slowly, this recent trend is the strongest predictor for the immediate future. The information from my research assistant reinforces this view, highlighting a 'recent rise' and, critically, a series of layoff announcements from large, economically significant companies across various sectors (tech, finance, retail). This suggests the labor market cooling is broad-based and not an isolated event. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because weekly jobless claims are an inherently noisy data series. A small fluctuation, administrative delay, or a temporary lull in layoff processing could easily cause the number for this single week to dip below the 220,000 threshold. The report's mention of significant decreases in several large states (Texas, New York) indicates some pockets of strength that could counterbalance the negative trend.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because ignoring the recent upward trend and the wave of announced layoffs would be imprudent. The confluence of these factors makes a sub-220,000 reading an upside surprise rather than a baseline expectation. For the outcome to be No, we would need to see a sharp and immediate reversal of the current trend.\n\nI would update my forecast lower (towards No) if the next two weekly jobless claims reports (for the weeks ending June 7 and June 14) show consecutive, significant drops. I would update higher if those reports show a continued acceleration above 230,000.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 exceed 220,000?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer. The claim requests a determination of basic eligibility for the Unemployment Insurance program.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 is greater than 220,000 according to [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA).&#x20;\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe recent rise in jobless claims was not uniform across the country.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
