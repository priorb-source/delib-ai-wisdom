  "information": "As of early June 2025, the Republican primary field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race includes Congressman Byron Donalds, who launched his campaign with an endorsement from former President Donald Trump. On the Democratic side, former U.S. Representative David Jolly, a former Republican and critic of Donald Trump, announced his candidacy on June 5, 2025. Governor Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited, has not endorsed a successor in the Republican primary.\n\nWhen asked about her potential 2026 gubernatorial candidacy, Casey DeSantis has consistently responded with noncommittal phrases such as, \"We'll see.\" As of early June 2025, there have been no public reports of official campaign staff hires, fundraising filings with the Florida Division of Elections, or other formal preparations for a campaign launch. Polling from early 2025 indicated a high favorability rating for her among registered Republicans, with one poll showing her at 57% compared to Byron Donalds' 27%. However, a separate internal poll conducted by the Donalds campaign showed him with a narrow lead over DeSantis, 34% to 30%.\n\nCasey DeSantis is facing public scrutiny related to a House probe into the Hope Florida foundation, an initiative she launched. The investigation was reported by multiple news outlets in late May and early June 2025. The next major campaign finance deadline is June 30, which marks the end of the second fundraising quarter. Historically, major candidates for Florida governor typically announce their campaigns between 8 and 18 months prior to the primary election, which is scheduled for August 2026.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days (from June 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement - Casey DeSantis has not announced her candidacy and there are no public reports of formal campaign preparations",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis continues delaying her decision past July 1, either because the House probe into Hope Florida foundation makes her risk-averse, she's deterred by Byron Donalds' Trump endorsement and existing campaign momentum, or she decides to wait until later in 2025 to see how the field develops before committing",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis makes a strategic decision to announce before the June 30 campaign finance deadline to begin fundraising in Q3 2025, believing she can overcome the Trump/Donalds challenge and that the Hope Florida probe won't significantly damage her candidacy, capitalizing on her remaining high favorability among Republican voters",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors NO. With only 26 days until the deadline and no reported campaign preparations (no staff hires, no fundraising filings, no formal infrastructure), an announcement seems unlikely. Casey DeSantis has been consistently noncommittal with 'We'll see' responses rather than signaling imminent entry. The ongoing House probe into Hope Florida adds political risk that would rationally discourage a near-term announcement. Byron Donalds already has Trump's endorsement and an active campaign, creating a higher barrier to entry. However, several factors prevent this from being near-zero: (1) The June 30 campaign finance deadline is a natural announcement point just 25 days away, (2) Her announcement would still fall within the historical 8-18 month window before the August 2026 primary, (3) She maintains high favorability in some polls (57%), (4) She hasn't definitively ruled out running, and (5) Governor DeSantis hasn't endorsed anyone, leaving the door open. For the probability to be higher, we'd need to see signals of campaign preparation, fundraising activity, or more definitive statements about running. For it to be lower, we'd need a definitive statement she's not running or the probe to intensify significantly. The 26-day window is tight but not impossible for a well-known figure with existing political infrastructure.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
