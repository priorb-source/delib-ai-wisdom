    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides the most critical piece of information I lacked: **current data showing 22.7 million California residents already in drought areas as of May 27, 2025**. This fundamentally changes the question from 'will drought worsen enough to reach the threshold?' to 'will drought improve enough to drop below the threshold?' With a 2.7 million person buffer (13.5%) and only 30 days remaining, this is a much stronger position for Yes. Forecaster 3 mentions potential storm systems but correctly notes these are short-term events unlikely to rapidly reverse established drought conditions. Their 65% forecast appears too cautious if the 22.7 million figure is accurate. Both forecasters correctly emphasize that droughts evolve slowly and the seasonal timing (entering California's dry season) heavily disfavors rapid improvement. The weekly Drought Monitor updates mean only 4-5 chances for conditions to change before resolution.",
    "rationale": "The current population already exceeding the threshold by 13.5% is decisive evidence requiring a substantial upward revision of my forecast. For a No outcome, drought-affected population must decrease by more than 2.7 million within 30 days during California's dry season - historically very unlikely without extraordinary sustained precipitation. The potential storm systems mentioned by Forecaster 3 represent short-term events that rarely produce the sustained moisture needed to remove drought designations from large population areas. Drought Monitor classifications change gradually based on multiple factors beyond single weather events. My initial 78% was too conservative because I was essentially forecasting whether the threshold would be reached, when it's already been exceeded with a comfortable buffer. The combination of: (1) already being above threshold, (2) short 30-day timeframe, (3) seasonal dry patterns, (4) slow drought evolution dynamics, and (5) no forecasts of sustained heavy precipitation systems, all strongly support a Yes outcome. I'm updating to 86%, slightly below Forecaster 2's 87% only to maintain modest uncertainty about data accuracy and inherent weather unpredictability, but essentially agreeing with their analysis.",
