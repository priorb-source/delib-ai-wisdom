    "review": "Both forecasters made nearly identical arguments to my original analysis, converging on 65% versus my 60%. We all identified the same key factors: December 2024's 6 cube sightings (though rare), the low bar of needing only ONE sighting in June 2025, active UAP reporting environment, and uncertainty about whether December was anomalous. Forecaster 3's point about only 10 days until June is relevant - there's little time for reporting patterns to shift dramatically. Neither forecaster raised fundamentally new evidence I hadn't considered, but the independent convergence at 60-65% is itself informative about the appropriate range. The main tension in all our analyses is between the 'rare' descriptor (suggesting scarcity) and December's robust data point of 6 sightings (suggesting non-trivial frequency). Forecaster 2's speculation about '1-3 cube-shaped sightings per average month' seems reasonable if we assume December was elevated but not wildly anomalous.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my original 60% was slightly too conservative. The convergence of three independent analyses at 60-65% suggests this range captures the appropriate uncertainty. The December 2024 data is recent, robust (6 reports, not just 1), and directly relevant. While 'rare' is a cautionary signal, it doesn't mean 'never' - and we only need ONE instance in an entire month. If we conservatively estimate that December was 2-3x an average month, we'd expect 2-3 cube reports in a typical month, making the probability of zero cube reports in June relatively low. However, I'm not moving all the way to 65% because the 'rare in history' descriptor deserves weight, we lack January-May 2025 data to confirm patterns, and seasonal or other factors may have influenced December's elevated count. The appropriate forecast accounts for both the strong recent evidence and the genuine uncertainty about base rates.",
