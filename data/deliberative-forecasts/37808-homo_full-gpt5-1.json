    "review": "Both forecasters largely align with my prior reasoning: strong institutional inertia, active DV-2026 operations, and a short time window make removal unlikely. They add two useful nuances: (1) stricter interpretation risk that a content replacement or redirect at the exact path could fail the criterion if it lacks “instructions for registering,” and (2) small risk of transient downtime at the moment of Metaculus’ check. Forecaster 3 also raises a rebranding/slug-change scenario for political optics. I find these tail risks plausible but modest on a six-week horizon. Overall, their arguments reinforce a high-probability outlook with a small haircut for path/content strictness and technical availability risks.",
    "rationale": "Key facts: DV-2026 results went live in May 2025; Entrant Status Check remains open through Sept 2026. Historically, the Step 1 page persists year-round with notes when entry is closed. Ending or materially altering the DV program before July 1 would require rapid legislation and implementation; even then, agencies usually revise pages rather than remove them immediately. Under the 2017–2021 period of opposition, these pages remained accessible.\n\nMain downside risks over the next ~6 weeks:\n- Exact-path risk: a State web restructure or slug change leading to a 404 or redirect from the specified URL; depending on strict interpretation, a redirect or a replacement notice without registration instructions could resolve No.\n- Content-change risk: the page could be revised to a notice lacking instructions for registering, even if the URL persists.\n- Availability risk: brief outage at the time Metaculus checks.\n\nThese combined tails feel in the mid–single digits. With active processing ongoing and a short horizon, I keep a high forecast. I slightly weight the strict-content interpretation risk but see no concrete signals of an imminent restructure or policy-mandated takedown before July 1.",
