    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days until July 1, 2025 (and Metaculus may check any time on or after that date).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — current regional security situation and airline suspensions make >51 destinations unlikely absent a clear rebound.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Continued cross‑border hostilities keep risk advisories high, European carriers and some leisure/seasonal services remain suspended, and the BEY page on flightsfrom.com shows roughly mid‑40s to low‑50s destinations, not exceeding 51 when checked in early July.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "MEA and Gulf/regional carriers sustain a broad network, several seasonal summer routes (e.g., Mediterranean leisure, secondary Egypt/Turkey/Iraq points, select European cities) operate as scheduled, and a couple of major European resumptions tip the BEY page to 52+ destinations when checked in July.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates and structure: Beirut (BEY) is MEA’s hub and historically supports a diversified regional network across the Gulf, Saudi Arabia (multiple cities), Iraq (several cities), Egypt (multiple airports), Turkey (IST/SAW and possibly Antalya), Levant (Amman, Larnaca, Athens), Caucasus (Yerevan, Tbilisi), Iran (Tehran), and a set of European trunk points (e.g., Paris, London, Rome/Milan, Geneva/Zurich, Vienna/Brussels). In stable times, this can approach or exceed 50 unique destinations.\n- Headwinds: Since late 2023, security risk from Israel–Hezbollah hostilities has depressed tourism and led to intermittent airline suspensions. Recent reporting (e.g., “summer canceled” narratives) suggests weak inbound demand and risk-averse European leisure carriers. Carriers tend to cut frequency first but also prune seasonal points; some majors have paused BEY at various times. With roughly six weeks to go, large-scale resumptions adding several unique destinations are less likely.\n- Tailwinds: BEY’s regional diaspora and essential travel underpin resilient links to Gulf/Saudi, Iraq, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, and a few European hubs. Summer schedules, if intact, can add seasonal points (e.g., Antalya, Greek islands/cities, Egyptian resorts). The threshold is modest (52+). If two or three European resumptions plus a couple of seasonal leisure routes materialize, it could clear 51.\n- Status quo weighting: Given the slow-moving nature of airline scheduling, and with only ~6 weeks to go, I put extra weight on the current schedule. The conflict backdrop and weak tourism argue that today’s network is at or below the threshold, with limited upside before July.\n- Why not higher: Security/risk advisories and cost pressures on Lebanon’s hospitality sector make additional European/seasonal launches improbable near term. Even if frequencies rise, unique-destination count may not.\n- Why not lower: MEA’s hub still spans many MENA points; Iraq/Saudi/Egypt/UAE/Qatar/Kuwait/Bahrain alone can tally a large share. A few European hubs and seasonal leisure routes could push the count near the low‑50s, so a >51 outcome remains plausible.\n- Key updates to watch: (1) The current flightsfrom.com/BEY destination count for late June–July; (2) announcements of resumptions or cancellations by Air France, Turkish, Pegasus, European leisure carriers, and MEA seasonal routes (e.g., Antalya, Greek islands, Egyptian resorts); (3) any escalation leading to airspace restrictions or airport closures (downside); (4) de‑escalation and tourism corridor promotions that trigger late seasonal adds (upside).\n- Research assistant: No additional information was provided, so this forecast relies on structural network knowledge, recent regional conditions, and timing relative to the summer schedule load.",
