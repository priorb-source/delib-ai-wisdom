The agency completes its effectiveness checks and is satisfied with the company's actions, leading it to officially change the recall status from 'Active' to 'Closed' before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The primary factor in this forecast is the typical duration of a USDA FSIS recall versus the time available. The recall was issued on April 24, 2025, leaving approximately 67 days until the July 1, 2025 deadline. My analysis suggests this is a tight, but not impossible, timeframe.\n\nThe status quo is that the recall is 'Active', making the default outcome 'No'. The world generally changes slowly, and bureaucratic processes like recall closures often take time. A significant volume of product—nearly 65,000 pounds—is involved, which suggests a potentially wide and complex distribution chain, making the process of recovering or verifying the disposition of all product more time-consuming.\n\nHowever, several factors C'Yes'. This is a Class I recall, the highest risk category, indicating a strong incentive for both the company and FSIS to resolve it quickly. The reason for the recall—an undeclared allergen—is also more straightforward to resolve than a recall for pathogen contamination, as it does not require a complex epidemiological investigation. The process is primarily logistical: tracking, recovering, and documenting the product.\n\nUltimately, I am weighing the significant product volume and the typically slow nature of these processes against the high-priority status and straightforward nature of an allergen recall. The two-month timeframe feels ambitious. Historical data has shown that recalls can often take several months to close. Therefore, I believe it is more likely than not that the process will extend beyond the July 1 deadline.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 40% because a swift closure is plausible given the Class I priority and the fact that it is not a pathogen-related recall. My forecast is not higher because the 65,000-pound quantity presents a significant logistical challenge that can easily lead to delays, making a sub-67-day closure less likely than a longer one.\n\nI would increase my probability if new information showed a very simple distribution chain or that a substantial majority of the product had already been accounted for. I would decrease my probability if there were reports of poor record-keeping by the company or a highly fragmented distribution network that would complicate product recovery.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by ACC Central Kitchen LLC of pork bun products issued April 24, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nConsumerAffairs: [Nearly 65,000 pounds of pork buns recalled for undeclared allergen](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/nearly-65000-pounds-of-pork-buns-recalled-for-undeclared-allergen-042525.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/acc-central-kitchen-llc-recalls-pork-bun-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
