  "information": "Tohoku's industrial production index for March 2025 increased by 7.6% month-over-month, the first rise in three months. The increase was driven by a 52.9% rise in machinery for industrial use, including semiconductors. For context, the nationwide preliminary Industrial Production Index for April 2025 showed a decline of 0.9% month-over-month. Historically, from 2015-2024, the monthly change for the Tohoku index was positive approximately 55% of the time, but the series exhibits modestly negative serial correlation, indicating a tendency for mean-reversion after large monthly movements.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 17 days, with the announcement expected around June 21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The industrial production index will decrease month-over-month in April, following the principle of mean reversion after an unusually large increase in March and aligning with the negative national trend.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The exceptionally strong 7.6% growth in March, heavily concentrated in the volatile industrial machinery sector, proves to be a one-off surge. Production levels revert to their mean in April, a trend exacerbated by the nationwide industrial production decline of 0.9%, resulting in a negative month-over-month reading for Tohoku.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The surge in the industrial machinery and semiconductor sector in March marks the beginning of a sustained upward trend, not a temporary spike. This strong regional momentum continues into April, powerful enough to overcome the modest national downturn and produce another month of positive growth.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the statistical evidence of mean reversion. The March industrial production index for Tohoku saw a massive 7.6% increase, a significant outlier. This was driven by a 52.9% rise in a single volatile component, industrial machinery. The research indicates the series has 'modestly negative serial correlation,' meaning such large positive movements are statistically more likely to be followed by a correction or a return to the average. This suggests a pullback in April is more probable than continued growth. This view is further supported by the nationwide preliminary index for April, which declined by 0.9%, indicating broader economic headwinds that Tohoku is unlikely to be completely immune to. The historical baseline shows a positive monthly change occurring 55% of the time between 2015-2024, which prevents the probability from being lower. However, the short-term dynamics—the outlier March reading and the negative serial correlation—are stronger signals in this case than the long-term base rate. My probability is not lower than 40% to account for the possibility that the March surge was the start of a genuine, strong recovery in a key sector, and to respect the historical base rate which slightly favors a 'Yes' outcome. My probability is not higher because this would disregard the strong statistical signal for mean reversion and the negative macroeconomic context provided by the national data. I would increase my forecast if I received information that the March surge was due to the start of long-term projects. I would decrease it if the surge was confirmed to be a single, non-recurring event.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Northeast Japan region (Tohoku) show a month-over-month increase in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tohoku's March industrial production index rises 7.6% from the previous month, the first increase in three months](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCC214DI0R20C25A5000000/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [industrial production announcement](https://www.tohoku.meti.go.jp/cyosa/tokei/iip.html) for April 2025 (expected approximately June 21, 2025) reports a monthly change in production (\"生産\") of greater than 0.0%.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nTohoku's industrial production index for March 2025 increased by 7.6% month-over-month, the first rise in three months. The increase was driven by a 52.9% rise in machinery for industrial use, including semiconductors.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
