    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides crucial new information about May 1st protests that I hadn't considered - this represents a second major coordinated national protest event occurring less than a month after April 5. The union involvement (SEIU) and May Day timing historically correlates with strong urban turnout. This strengthens the case for Yes. However, Forecaster 3 raises an important counterpoint about protest fragmentation - average sizes of 60-88 participants suggest a structural shift toward distributed actions rather than mass mobilizations. This is a valid concern that moderates the optimism from having two major coordinated events. All three of us, however, share a critical blind spot: none of us have direct evidence from the Global Protest Tracker itself about whether these events were documented or met the threshold. We're inferring from news reports and historical patterns. Forecaster 3's 30% seems too pessimistic given two major coordinated events have already occurred with 2 months remaining. Forecaster 2's 87% may overweight the May 1 event without adequately accounting for fragmentation trends and reporting uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "The May 1st protests represent significant new information that increases my confidence. Having two nationally coordinated multi-city protests within a month (April 5 and May 1) substantially increases the probability that at least one location exceeded 10,000 participants. Large US protests typically concentrate in major metropolitan areas - with 600,000+ participants across April 5 events and another major mobilization on May 1, basic probability suggests flagship events in cities like DC, NYC, or LA likely exceeded 10,000. However, Forecaster 3's fragmentation data is a legitimate concern that prevents me from going as high as 87%. The shift toward smaller, more distributed protests could mean even nationally coordinated events don't produce individual 10,000+ gatherings. Additionally, we still lack direct confirmation from the Global Protest Tracker itself. I'm updating upward from 70% to 76% based on: (1) the May 1 event adding a second major data point, (2) 2 months remaining for additional protests or documentation, and (3) historical precedent that coordinated national protests do produce large individual events. I'm not going higher due to fragmentation trends and reporting uncertainty.",
