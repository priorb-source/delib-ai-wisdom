    "review": "The other two forecasters presented analyses that strongly align with my own, creating a consensus around the core factors driving this forecast. We all agree that the primary evidence pointing to a 'No' outcome is the long history of Milorad Dodik making threats of an independence referendum without ever officially scheduling one. We also concur on the powerful disincentives, namely severe international sanctions and opposition from key ally Serbia. Forecaster 2 added the valuable observation that there is a current lack of preparatory political moves, which one would expect if such a significant announcement were imminent. Forecaster 3 provided a more detailed scenario for a 'Yes' outcome, identifying a 'sharp trigger' (such as a new OHR imposition) as the most likely catalyst, which led to their slightly higher forecast of 15%. This detailed scenario is convincing as the most plausible path to 'Yes'.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 10%. The deliberation has reinforced my confidence in my initial reasoning rather than altering it. The arguments presented by the other forecasters, particularly the historical precedent and the significant international pressure, confirm that the status quo of brinkmanship without crossing this specific red line is the most likely outcome. Forecaster 2's point about the absence of preparatory signals is a strong piece of evidence supporting a 'No' result within the very short 60-day timeframe. While I find Forecaster 3's 'sharp trigger' scenario to be the most credible pathway to a 'Yes' resolution, I believe a 10% probability adequately accounts for this tail risk. The probability of such a specific trigger occurring *and* Dodik choosing this particular, highly costly response (as opposed to other escalatory but less severe options) within the next two months remains low. The fundamental calculus for the RS leadership—that the rhetorical value of the threat of a referendum outweighs the catastrophic costs of actually scheduling one—has not changed.",
