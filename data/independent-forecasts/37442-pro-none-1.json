    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 9 days. 13F filings for the quarter ending March 31, 2025, are due by May 15, 2025. Today is May 6, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo is that Berkshire Hathaway's investment managers did not find Domino's Pizza stock compellingly priced during Q1 2025 and therefore did not significantly add to their existing position.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 13F filing is released on or before May 15, 2025. It reveals that Berkshire Hathaway's holdings in Domino's Pizza are either unchanged or have not increased enough to cross the 2,382,000 share threshold. This would indicate they were content with their initial stake or believed the stock was fairly valued during the quarter.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The 13F filing reveals a holding of more than 2,382,000 shares. This would mean that one of Berkshire's investment managers saw a significant opportunity in Domino's during the first quarter – perhaps due to a temporary price dip or increased conviction in its long-term strategy – and decided to build a larger position.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards 'No' primarily due to institutional inertia. Berkshire Hathaway is a long-term holder and does not trade frequently. The most probable course of action for any given quarter is to maintain existing positions unless a compelling valuation opportunity arises. The background information confirms an initial stake was purchased, but increasing a position requires a separate, distinct decision based on market conditions during Q1 2025. Without specific evidence of a significant price dip in DPZ stock during that period or other positive catalysts, the default assumption must be that they stood pat. My forecast is not lower than 25% because building a full position over multiple quarters is a common strategy for large investors like Berkshire to avoid driving up the stock price. The initial purchase signals genuine interest, making a subsequent purchase more plausible than for a random stock. My forecast is not higher because there is no public information or market signal to suggest that Berkshire was actively accumulating shares in Q1. A higher probability would require more specific evidence. I would increase my forecast if I learned that DPZ stock was significantly undervalued or experienced a temporary downturn during Q1 2025. Conversely, I would decrease it if the stock had appreciated substantially, making it a less attractive value proposition.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Domino's Pizza stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nRetailWire: [Domino’s Pizza Stake Purchased by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Group](https://retailwire.com/dominos-pizza-warren-buffett/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 2,382,000 shares of Domino's Pizza, Inc. (ticker symbol DPZ).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
