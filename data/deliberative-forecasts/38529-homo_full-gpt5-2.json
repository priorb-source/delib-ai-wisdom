    "review": "Both forecasters’ cases closely mirror mine: consistent double‑digit first‑choice leads across multiple pollsters, a Marist RCV simulation showing Cuomo clearing 50%, and coalition/organizational advantages (Orthodox blocs, Hispanic outreach, IE spending). New emphasis that I hadn’t explicitly called out: NYC Democratic primary electorates skew older/more moderate, which structurally favors Cuomo; union endorsement dynamics could still shift late; and the possibility of an enthusiasm-driven progressive turnout spike. Forecaster 2 highlights momentum/narrowing risk and RCV volatility—fair caveats already partly embedded in my downside risks. No materially new data were introduced, just framing and emphasis I agree with.",
    "rationale": "The evidence base remains: Cuomo polling ~37–43% first-choice with a 15–20 pt edge and at least one credible RCV simulation putting him over 50%. His coalition appears more turnout-reliable, and resources/IEs favor him. Counter-risks—RCV transfer uncertainty, anti-Cuomo sentiment, left consolidation behind Mamdani, and late-breaking news—keep this below the mid‑80s. The “older/moderate electorate” point marginally strengthens Cuomo’s case, while “narrowing/momentum” marginally offsets it. Net, these balance out, so I’m keeping my forecast where it was.",
