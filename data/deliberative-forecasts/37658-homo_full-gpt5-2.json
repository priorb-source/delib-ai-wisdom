    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 both rightly stress that the question is about pre–July 1 termination (via an 8‑K), not the ultimate fate of the deal. Forecaster 3’s skepticism about the existence of a formal, enforceable presidential prohibition with a firm June 18 effective date is especially important; if that premise is wrong or un‑stayed, the main forcing event evaporates and near‑term termination odds fall. Forecaster 2’s framing of June 18 as a potential inflection is useful but contingent on a fact pattern that may not be in place. Both also highlight status‑quo inertia and the possibility that, even after adverse developments, parties may litigate or delay rather than immediately terminate—plus the 8‑K timing window risk. I find those arguments persuasive and they correct my prior over‑weighting of a June 18 trigger.",
    "rationale": "I’m updating down materially because the case for a near‑term termination hinges on there being a formal, enforceable presidential/CFIUS prohibition effective by mid‑June without a court stay. I cannot verify that such an order exists or will take effect on June 18. Absent that, the baseline is continued process and litigation, not an 8‑K termination in the next ~6 weeks. Market pricing (U.S. Steel at ~44 vs. 55) indicates meaningful eventual failure risk but doesn’t imply a collapse on this short horizon. Activist involvement and ongoing outreach also point to preserving optionality rather than abandoning imminently. Even if a prohibition does become effective around June 18, there remains risk of a stay and of 8‑K timing slipping into early July. Given these considerations, I lower my estimate from 65% to 35%. I would move up if there’s confirmed, un‑stayed presidential action requiring abandonment effective before July 1 or explicit company guidance of imminent termination; I would move down if courts issue a stay, if credible mitigation paths emerge, or if companies signal extensions/continued pursuit beyond July.",
