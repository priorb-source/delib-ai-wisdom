    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "10 days - the deadline is May 1, 2025, and today is April 21, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - there has been no announcement yet, and with only 10 days remaining, the default outcome is that no announcement will be made before the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Haley Stevens decides not to run for the Michigan Senate seat, delays her announcement for strategic reasons until after May 1, or another Democrat emerges as the consensus candidate making her entry unnecessary. She may choose to focus on her House seat instead.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Haley Stevens announces her Senate candidacy in the remaining 10 days. This could happen if party leaders encouraged her to enter after other top contenders withdrew, or if she had been preparing behind the scenes and is ready to launch her campaign before the May 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "With only 10 days remaining until the May 1 deadline, the status quo strongly favors a No resolution. The CNN article from April 10 (11 days ago) indicates Democrats are struggling to find top-tier candidates after Whitmer and Buttigieg declined to run. While this creates an opening for Stevens, a sitting U.S. Representative from Michigan, we have no intelligence suggesting an imminent announcement. Major Senate candidacy announcements typically involve weeks of preparation including fundraising infrastructure, staff recruitment, party coordination, and advance media signals - none of which have been reported. The research assistant provided no additional information suggesting Stevens is preparing to announce. Good forecasters heavily weight the status quo because the world changes slowly. With 10 days left and zero signals of an announcement, the most likely outcome is that May 1 arrives without Stevens having declared. However, I'm not going lower than 15% because: (1) 10 days is technically sufficient time for an announcement, (2) the race appears unsettled, creating opportunity, (3) Stevens is a credible candidate who might be under pressure from party leaders to enter, and (4) politicians occasionally make surprise announcements. To update higher, I'd need reports of Stevens scheduling a major announcement, fundraising activity, or communications suggesting candidacy preparation. To update lower, I'd need Stevens explicitly ruling out a run or endorsing another candidate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Haley Stevens announce her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [Democrats lose another top contender for US Senate seat in Michigan after Whitmer and Buttigieg bow out](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/politics/michigan-senate-race-democrats-mcdonald-rivet/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Haley Stevens announces her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
