  "information": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump have had several communications in 2025. On February 12, they spoke for about an hour about peace efforts and cooperation. On March 19, they spoke again, with Zelenskyy expecting to be briefed on Trump's prior conversation with Vladimir Putin. On May 10, following a meeting with European leaders in Kyiv, Zelenskyy spoke with Trump, stating that Ukraine was ready for direct peace talks if a 30-day ceasefire was agreed upon. On the same day, European leaders also held a joint call with Trump from Kyiv.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, until June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Based on the established recent pattern, the leaders are in frequent communication about an urgent and ongoing issue, making another call within the resolution window the expected outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Diplomatic efforts stall, or the primary communication shifts to lower-level envoys for the next month. Alternatively, the May 10 call was comprehensive enough that another conversation between the leaders is not required before June 15.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A response from Russia to the ceasefire proposal discussed on May 10, or another significant development regarding the war in Ukraine, prompts a follow-up discussion between Trump and Zelenskyy to coordinate their strategy.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the evidence of recent and frequent communication between the two leaders. The research confirms Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy have spoken three times in the last three months (February 12, March 19, and May 10), establishing a clear pattern of direct and regular contact. The subject of these calls—peace negotiations—is a matter of extreme urgency and is highly dynamic, making it probable that developments requiring their direct consultation will arise within the one-month forecast window. The most recent call on May 10, which concerned a specific ceasefire proposal, suggests that diplomatic efforts are at a critical juncture, which I assess is more likely to increase the frequency of communication than decrease it.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 80% because a 'No' outcome remains plausible. The diplomatic process could stall, or communication could be delegated to lower-level envoys for a period. It is also possible that the May 10 call was sufficiently comprehensive to guide actions for the next month without requiring another direct conversation between the principals. The interval between their last two calls was 52 days, so a month-long period without a call is not unprecedented in their recent history.\n\nConversely, the probability is not lower because ignoring the established high frequency of communication on such a critical topic would be imprudent. The status quo is one of active dialogue, making a sudden month-long silence the less likely scenario.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were public reports of a Russian response to the ceasefire proposal. I would decrease my forecast upon news of a breakdown in negotiations or a joint statement confirming that envoys will be handling discussions for the foreseeable future.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSky News: [Key moments that have shaped Trump and Zelenskyy's relationship](https://news.sky.com/story/trump-and-zelenskyys-relationship-from-perfect-phone-call-to-oval-office-clash-13331892)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both individuals, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump have had several communications in 2025. On February 12, they spoke for about an hour about peace efforts and cooperation. On March 19, they spoke again, with Zelenskyy expecting to be briefed on Trump's prior conversation with Vladimir Putin.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
