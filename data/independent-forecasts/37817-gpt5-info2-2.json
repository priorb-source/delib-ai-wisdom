  "information": "As of early 2024, there were four to five regularly scheduled direct flight destinations from Koror, including Guam (operated by United Airlines), Manila (United Airlines), Taipei (China Airlines), and Brisbane (Qantas). In addition to scheduled services, Japan Airlines (JAL) resumed direct charter flights from Narita to Palau in March 2025 after a five-year suspension.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (≈41 days) until July 1, 2025; Metaculus may check a bit later.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — flightsfrom.com likely lists 4–5 destinations from ROR, not greater than 5.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By early July, flightsfrom.com shows Guam, Taipei, Manila, and Brisbane (and possibly Yap is absent or seasonal); JAL’s Narita operation remains charter-only and thus not listed as a scheduled route; no Korean carrier resumes scheduled ICN–ROR. Net unique destinations stay at 4–5.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least two of the following are listed as scheduled on flightsfrom.com: (1) a Korean carrier (e.g., ICN–ROR) resumes scheduled service for summer 2025; (2) United’s Koror–Yap segment appears as a scheduled non-stop; (3) JAL’s Narita flights are loaded as a scheduled seasonal service rather than ad-hoc charters; (4) another regional addition (e.g., Singapore, Hong Kong, or Clark). This brings total unique direct destinations to ≥6.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: Small Pacific island hubs typically sustain a handful of routes. The research assistant notes 4–5 scheduled destinations as of early 2024/2025: Guam (United), Taipei (China Airlines), Manila (United), and Brisbane (Qantas). JAL resumed Narita–Koror as charters in March 2025, which often do not appear on flightsfrom.com as scheduled services. Korean demand has lagged per the cited article, and Korean routes have been slow to restart.\n- What needs to happen for Yes: With 4–5 already, ROR needs at least one to two additional scheduled destinations to get past 5. The most plausible adds by early July are (a) a scheduled Korea service (ICN) loaded in GDS for summer, and/or (b) Yap being listed as a scheduled non-stop if United is reliably operating it, and/or (c) JAL shifting from charter to scheduled seasonal. New starts usually have longer lead times; we’re ~6 weeks out, making fresh additions less likely. There’s also downside risk that a seasonal (e.g., Brisbane) pauses, which would move the count the wrong direction.\n- Weighting the status quo: Given slow tourism recovery and the short runway to July, the default is stability at ≤5. Flightsfrom.com’s criteria (scheduled services only) further reduce the chance that charters (e.g., JAL) will count.\n- Why not higher: To get to >5, ROR likely needs two favorable listing changes (e.g., both ICN and Yap, or ICN and scheduled NRT). That’s a heavy lift within weeks, with weak demand signals from Korea and uncertainty about how charters are displayed.\n- Why not lower: There are several near-miss levers that could flip this to Yes: United’s Yap leg appearing as scheduled, JAL publishing a scheduled seasonal series, or a single Korean carrier loading a July start. Metaculus may also check a bit after July 1, giving a little extra time for a July schedule change to appear.\n- What would move me up: Confirmation in OAG/GDS or airline announcements that (1) ICN–ROR starts as a scheduled route in July, (2) JAL’s NRT–ROR is published as scheduled seasonal service, or (3) any additional scheduled route (e.g., Singapore/HK/Clark) is loaded. Also, evidence that United’s Yap leg is consistently scheduled and listed on flightsfrom.com.\n- What would move me down: News that Qantas pauses Brisbane–Koror in early July, or that Manila service is reduced/suspended; confirmation that JAL remains charter-only and that Yap is not listed as a scheduled non-stop.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 5 direct flight destinations from Koror, Palau on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMarketplace: [Why hasn’t tourism recovered in Palau?

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 5 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Koror (ROR)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/ROR) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early 2024, there were four to five regularly scheduled direct flight destinations from Koror, including Guam (operated by United Airlines), Manila (United Airlines), Taipei (China Airlines), and Brisbane (Qantas).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
