  "information": "Donald Trump has a history of attending high-profile sporting events. His recent UFC appearances include UFC 309 in November 2024 and UFC 314 on April 13, 2025. His attendance at UFC 314 was noted on his official public schedule. The time between UFC 314 in Miami and UFC 316 in Newark is less than two months. Some analyses of his past behavior suggest he rarely attends two UFC events in such close succession.\n\nUFC 316 is scheduled for June 7, 2025, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey. The event's main fight is a bantamweight title rematch between Sean O'Malley and Merab Dvalishvili. Donald Trump and UFC President Dana White have a long-standing public friendship. In the past, Trump hosted early UFC events at his properties, including the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. White has publicly supported Trump, including an appearance at the 2024 National Republican Convention.\n\nAt UFC 314 in Miami on April 13, 2025, Donald Trump was seen with Dana White and Elon Musk. Reports also mentioned the presence of political figures such as Kash Patel, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Kristi Noem, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio. Trump was greeted by Shaquille O'Neal and Joe Rogan, and he entered the arena to the song 'American Bad Ass' by Kid Rock, receiving a positive reaction from the crowd.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 38 days (until Saturday, June 7, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump spends that weekend away from the NYC/NJ area (e.g., rally, fundraiser, or official event elsewhere), or the White House schedule/security team opts against another UFC appearance so soon after UFC 314; he does not enter the Prudential Center grounds at any point on June 7.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump spends the weekend in Bedminster, NJ, makes a short, planned stop at the Prudential Center in Newark, and appears cageside or backstage with Dana White during UFC 316.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Over the past two years Trump has attended multiple UFC PPVs but still only a minority of total cards, so the status quo leans No for any given event. He did attend UFC 314 on Apr 13, 2025, and UFC 309 in Nov 2024, consistent with his pattern of showing up at marquee East Coast/Miami events and his long-standing friendship with Dana White. UFC 316 (June 7, 2025) is at the Prudential Center in Newark, which is close to Trump’s Bedminster residence and NYC, lowering logistical friction. The headliner (per assistant: O’Malley vs. Dvalishvili) is a major draw, which marginally increases appeal.\nCountervailing factors: He rarely attends two UFC events in such close succession (less than two months, per the assistant’s summary), and as sitting president, weekend schedule, optics, and security considerations can preempt discretionary appearances. He also skipped Newark UFC 302 in 2024, suggesting Newark is not an automatic stop for him.\nWhy not higher: Base rate—he attends fewer than half of UFC PPVs; recent attendance at 314 makes back-to-back appearances less typical; potential competing official/campaign events on June 7 could crowd out the opportunity.\nWhy not lower: Proximity to Bedminster/NYC, his consistent enjoyment of UFC optics, Dana White’s support, and O’Malley’s star power all raise the odds above a generic PPV. Newark logistics are easier than many alternatives.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports or hints from Dana White/UFC, leaks of planned attendance, inclusion on the president’s public schedule, advance security activity at Prudential Center tied to a presidential visit, or Trump being in Bedminster that weekend.\nWhat would move me down: A same-evening rally/fundraiser or official duty in another state, travel abroad, credible reporting he will not attend, or security/logistics constraints at the venue.",
