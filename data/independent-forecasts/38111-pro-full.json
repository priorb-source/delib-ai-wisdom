  "information": "A high-level international conference on the two-state solution is scheduled for June 17-20, 2025, at the UN headquarters in New York. The conference is co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia and is based on a UN General Assembly resolution from December 2024. Its stated aim is to generate momentum for more countries to recognize a Palestinian state. Supporting this effort, the Arab Group at the UN has urged member countries to recognize Palestine as a step toward lasting peace. Additionally, the 'Madrid+' group, comprising Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and Norway, has called for Palestine's full UN membership, describing it as a \"political and diplomatic necessity.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has stated that recognizing a Palestinian state is a \"moral and political obligation\" and has indicated that France may officially grant recognition during the June UN conference, although he has also tied the move to certain conditions. In May 2025, the UK announced it had joined France's initiative for the recognition of a Palestinian state. According to a report by Axios, Malta is also preparing to declare Palestine's independence at the summit on June 20. Five Arab countries—Egypt, Jordan, Qatar, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia—have announced their active participation in organizing the conference.\n\nAs of May 2025, 147 out of 193 UN member states officially recognize the State of Palestine, while 46 members do not. The non-recognizing states include most Western European nations, the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea. In 2024, five countries newly recognized Palestine: Norway, Ireland, Spain, Slovenia, and Armenia. The Israeli government strongly opposes the international recognition effort. An Israeli official stated the country \"will not cooperate\" with such measures and warned of potential further annexation of the West Bank. The United States and several other G7 members also continue to withhold official recognition.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. No new country recognizes Palestine in June 2025, maintaining the current diplomatic alignments.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the high-level UN conference, intense diplomatic pressure from the United States and Israel persuades key potential recognizers like France, the UK, and Malta to delay their announcements. They cite unmet conditions or the need for broader consensus, pushing any potential recognition beyond the June 2025 timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The UN conference from June 17-20 serves as a catalyst. During the summit, at least one country, such as Malta or the conference co-chair France, formally announces its recognition of the State of Palestine, capitalizing on the international political momentum and creating a diplomatic cascade.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is based on strong, converging evidence pointing towards a recognition event in June 2025. The primary driver is the high-level international conference (June 17-20) explicitly designed to generate momentum for this outcome. This conference creates a powerful focal point and a political deadline. Several key actors are primed to act: France's president has called recognition a 'moral and political obligation' and hinted at an announcement during the conference. The UK has joined this initiative. Most concretely, a credible Axios report states Malta is actively preparing to recognize Palestine at the summit. Since the question resolves 'Yes' if just one country makes the move, and there are several strong candidates, the likelihood is high. \n\nThe probability is not higher because recognition remains a contentious issue subject to intense counter-pressure from the US and Israel. Stated intentions from leaders like Macron have been conditional, providing a potential off-ramp if political calculations change. The status quo is a powerful force, and a coordinated decision to delay is a plausible alternative. \n\nHowever, the weight of a dedicated conference, public signaling from multiple European nations, and specific intelligence about Malta's plans make a 'Yes' outcome significantly more likely than 'No'. I would increase my forecast if France or the UK issues a more definitive, unconditional statement. I would decrease it if the US were to announce a major diplomatic counter-offensive or if the conference were postponed.",
