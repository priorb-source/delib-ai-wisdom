    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement is made. Martial law remains in force and authorities avoid scheduling a presidential election while the war continues.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Verkhovna Rada extends martial law again into late summer/early autumn 2025, senior officials reiterate that elections cannot be conducted under martial law, and no binding parliamentary resolution is passed setting a date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Verkhovna Rada adopts a formal resolution setting a specific election date (likely in late 2025), either alongside a plan to lift martial law by then or via rapid legal changes that permit scheduling. Alternatively, martial law is lifted sooner than expected and parliament promptly schedules the election date before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Legal/institutional baseline: Under Ukraine’s current legal framework, nationwide elections are not held during martial law, and the election date is set by the Verkhovna Rada. Announcing a specific date would typically imply initiating the election process, which authorities have consistently avoided during wartime. The status quo is therefore strongly No.\n- Timing: Only about six weeks remain. Announcing a date would require visible political preparation: a parliamentary resolution, likely public debate, and probably accompanying legal or security planning. None of that tends to happen quietly or overnight, and there has been a clear pattern of rolling 90-day extensions of martial law.\n- Political/security context: Active hostilities, mobilization pressures, and territorial/security risks make near-term scheduling unlikely. While there is periodic domestic and international discussion about democratic legitimacy, the Ukrainian leadership has consistently signaled that elections should wait until conditions permit safe, inclusive voting, including for displaced persons and areas near the front.\n- What could raise the probability: Credible reports that (1) martial law will be lifted imminently or on a fixed near-term timetable, (2) a parliamentary coalition is preparing a resolution to set an election date, or (3) legal changes enabling scheduling during martial law are fast-tracked with broad support. A sudden stabilization of the front or a political commitment tied to international support could also move this higher.\n- What could lower it further: Fresh major escalations or a newly passed extension of martial law into autumn 2025, along with explicit statements from top officials ruling out any scheduling until after specific security milestones.\n- Research assistant note: No additional information provided; forecast is based on the legal framework, historical extensions of martial law, and the short time window.\n- Why not higher: The confluence of legal constraints, ongoing war, and limited time makes a parliamentary announcement by July 1 atypical.\n- Why not lower: A small chance remains that Kyiv chooses to set a future date (e.g., late 2025) as a political signal, contingent on lifting martial law, or that a rapid legal workaround emerges with strong domestic and allied support.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine announce a presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Next Ukrainian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_presidential_election)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
