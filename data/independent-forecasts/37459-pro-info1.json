  "information": "According to reports, Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks for nine to ten consecutive quarters through Q4 2024, with cash reserves reaching between $334 billion and $347.7 billion by the end of that year. The company's portfolio turnover rate is 0.97%. Warren Buffett recently stated that the 'Magnificent Seven' companies require more capital to operate today than they did a few years ago, reiterating that Berkshire Hathaway's investment philosophy is to seek companies with high returns and low capital needs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. The Q1 2025 13F filing is due by May 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of the last publicly available filing (Q4 2024), Berkshire Hathaway did not hold any shares in Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway continues its established investment discipline through Q1 2025. Finding the valuations of the target tech companies unattractive and inconsistent with their investment criteria, they make no new purchases in this group. Their Q1 2025 13F filing subsequently shows no new holdings in these specific Magnificent 7 stocks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One of Warren Buffett's investment managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, identifies a long-term value opportunity in one of the specified tech giants, likely Alphabet or Microsoft, perhaps due to a temporary price dislocation during the first quarter. They initiate a new position, which is then disclosed in the Q1 2025 13F filing.",
    "rationale": "The basis for this forecast is overwhelmingly weighted towards the status quo. Berkshire Hathaway's investment strategy is characterized by a long-term horizon and a very low portfolio turnover rate (0.97%). The company has not historically held positions in the target companies (Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla). \n\nInformation from my research assistant strongly supports this outlook. Berkshire has been a net seller of equities for approximately ten consecutive quarters through Q4 2024, building a record cash hoard. This behavior signals a broad view that market valuations are high and attractive opportunities are scarce. Furthermore, Warren Buffett's recent remarks specifically singled out the 'Magnificent Seven' for their increasing capital requirements, which directly opposes his stated preference for businesses with high returns on low capital. This suggests a fundamental aversion to their current business dynamics.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 5% because there is a non-zero chance that one of the other investment managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, made a move. They have more latitude and a demonstrated willingness to invest in technology companies (e.g., Apple, Amazon). A company like Alphabet or Microsoft, with strong competitive moats and massive cash flows, could plausibly fit their framework if the price were right during a specific window in Q1. \n\nMy forecast is not higher than 5% because a new investment in one of these high-profile stocks would represent a significant departure from Berkshire's recent actions (net selling) and Buffett's explicit commentary. The weight of evidence points to continued patience and discipline. For this forecast to increase, there would need to be evidence of a substantial market correction in Q1 that made these companies' valuations undeniably compelling by Berkshire's standards.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of any Magnificent 7 stock other than Amazon and Apple in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nInvestopedia: [Berkshire Hathaway Doesn't Hold Nvidia Stock—Will Warren Buffett Come to Regret it?](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffetts-secret-portfolio-dumping-shares-3-supercharged-artificial-intelligence-ai)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding shares of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to reports, Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks for nine to ten consecutive quarters through Q4 2024, with cash reserves reaching between $334 billion and $347.7 billion by the end of that year.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
