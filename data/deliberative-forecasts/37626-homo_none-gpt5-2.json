    "review": "Both forecasters align with my core view: the series is low-volatility, the threshold is strict (must be < $0.6300), and near-term cost/logistics narratives tilt modestly upward. They add a few considerations I hadn’t explicitly highlighted: (1) Panama Canal constraints/freight as an ongoing upward pressure; (2) potential May seasonality/promo cycles and a firmer USD as mild downward forces; and (3) emphasizing the importance of the April print as a key update signal. These are reasonable nuances but don’t materially change the balance of risks without fresh data. I find their reasoning sound and broadly consistent with my own priors.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is short and the April reading isn’t yet available. Inertia and the historical stickiness of banana prices around the low-to-mid $0.60s imply that moving below a tight < $0.6300 threshold in a single month is possible but not the base case. Qualitative pressures (supplier and logistics costs) still lean slightly upward; countervailing factors (possible promos, modest seasonality, somewhat firm USD) provide some chance of a dip but lack concrete evidence of broad-based retail price cuts. Given no new quantitative information, I keep a slight tilt against Yes. I would adjust meaningfully only upon seeing April at/under ~$0.632 or clear signs of lower May wholesale/shipping costs or widespread retail promotions.",
