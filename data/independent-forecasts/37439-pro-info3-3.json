  "information": "Donald Trump is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates in mid-May 2025 to participate in a Gulf summit. In late April, Trump mentioned the possibility of a meeting with Putin during this trip. On May 5, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Putin's schedule does not currently include a trip to the Middle East.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks. The question resolves on June 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. There is currently no scheduled phone call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, and official communication from the Kremlin has downplayed the possibility of a near-term high-level meeting.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite Trump's public interest in speaking with Putin, diplomatic channels fail to establish a mutually agreeable agenda or a compelling reason for a call within the short timeframe. Domestic political pressure and objections from key allies persuade the Trump administration to postpone direct leader-to-leader contact, making a call before June 15 unfeasible.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seeking to project an image as a decisive peacemaker, Trump directs his national security team to arrange a call to discuss a new proposal to end the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin agrees, seeing an opportunity to engage directly with the new administration. The call is officially announced by both the White House and the Kremlin shortly after it occurs in late May.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the significant diplomatic and political inertia that typically prevents high-level calls between adversarial leaders from being arranged on short notice. The status quo is that no call is planned. The Kremlin's recent statement, while specifically addressing a potential in-person meeting, signals a lack of urgency for a summit of any kind. Arranging a call that both sides feel is productive, and that both would be willing to publicly acknowledge, would require significant back-channel preparation that does not appear to be underway. The primary reason my forecast is not lower is Donald Trump's well-established preference for personal, leader-to-leader diplomacy and his potential desire for a quick, high-profile foreign policy action. His unpredictability and willingness to bypass traditional diplomatic processes mean a call cannot be ruled out. A sudden international crisis could also dramatically increase the odds of a call. My forecast is not higher because Trump's desires alone are insufficient; it requires Russian agreement on timing and substance, and overcoming significant political headwinds both domestically and internationally. For me to increase my probability, I would need to see credible reports of preparatory talks between US and Russian officials. For me to decrease my probability, I would need to see a firm, official statement from either side explicitly ruling out a call in this timeframe.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both Trump and Putin, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDonald Trump is scheduled to travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates in mid-May 2025 to participate in a Gulf summit. In late April, Trump mentioned the possibility of a meeting with Putin during this trip. On May 5, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov stated that Putin's schedule does not currently include a trip to the Middle East.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
