  "information": "Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service after posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to spell '86 47'. The number '86' can be slang for 'kill' or 'remove,' and Donald Trump is the 47th president. Following the post, Comey was interviewed by the Secret Service but was not arrested. He later deleted the post, stating, 'I didn't realize that some people associate these numbers with violence. I oppose all forms of violence, so I deleted the post.' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the investigation.\n\nSeveral public figures have called for legal action against James Comey. General Michael Flynn predicted that Comey will be indicted. The InfoWars platform cited alleged Department of Justice sources claiming Comey's indictment is 'imminent.' Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett stated that Comey could be prosecuted for the post. Current FBI Director Chris Wray reported that the agency has faced a surge in threats against Donald Trump following Comey's post, requiring agents to be diverted from other cases.\n\nAs of late May 2025, no charges have been filed against James Comey, nor have any warrants or subpoenas been issued in relation to the social media post. Legal experts suggest a prosecution faces significant hurdles due to First Amendment protections and a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that requires prosecutors to prove a subjective intent to threaten. Historically, arresting former FBI directors or other ex-cabinet-level officials is extremely rare in the United States.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service inquiry concludes without charges; no other jurisdiction brings a case; Comey keeps a low profile and is not detained for any reason through June 30, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A politically driven move leads to a quick arrest on a threats-related theory tied to the ‘86 47’ post; or a separate, unrelated law-enforcement encounter (e.g., contempt, protest-related detention, or a state/local issue) results in him being taken into custody before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Short horizon, weak case signals, and strong speech protections all favor No. The New York Times reported the Secret Service questioned James Comey about his ‘86 47’ post; he deleted it and disclaimed violent intent. As of late May, there are no charges, warrants, or public indications of imminent arrest. Federal prosecutions for threats generally require proof the statement was a true threat with subjective intent (e.g., Counterman v. Colorado, 2023). The ambiguous, deniable nature of the seashell photo makes probable cause and especially sustainable charges harder. Secret Service inquiries into speech are common; arrests are rare absent explicit threats or other criminality. Base rates for arresting a former FBI director are near zero, and building and approving a high-profile case typically takes longer than a month. The question resolves Yes for any arrest anywhere, but Comey is a low-base-rate individual for incidental arrests (e.g., protests, DUI), further lowering odds. Why not higher: No credible reporting of active charging decisions, grand jury movement, subpoenas, or a criminal complaint; strong First Amendment hurdles; institutional caution around an unprecedented arrest. Why not lower: The political environment raises tail risk of an aggressive or symbolic action; in principle, authorities could arrest first on a complaint if they believed probable cause existed; any unrelated arrest would also resolve Yes. What would move me up: Credible reports of a criminal complaint/sealed filing, grand jury activity targeting Comey, formal subpoenas he resists, or new statements/posts that look like explicit threats. What would move me down: Official statements indicating the inquiry is closed with no action, or the passage of another two weeks with no new signals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFormer FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service after posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to spell '86 47'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
