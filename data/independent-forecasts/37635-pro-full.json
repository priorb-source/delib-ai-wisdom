  "information": "According to reports from May 2025, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has achieved a 76% approval rating, making her the best-evaluated president since the 1994-2000 term. In specific areas, 63.4% of respondents positively evaluated her management of poverty reduction, and her administration's policies have been linked to a 24.9% reduction in homicides. However, on transparency and anti-corruption, 57.4% of respondents had a negative perception. Her administration has announced a $298 billion investment plan. Some polls cited her approval rating as high as 82%.\n\nA survey in Argentina conducted between April 28 and 30, 2025, by D'Alessio IROL/Berensztein indicated growing wear on Javier Milei's government. The survey showed his positive image has decreased to 44%, while his negative image has increased to 52%, for a net differential of -8%. 52% of respondents believe the economic situation is worse than the previous year. The evaluation of his government is divided, with 50% rating it as good and 48% as bad. Security Minister Patricia Bullrich has the highest positive image in the cabinet at 47%, as insecurity is the main social concern for 72% of respondents.\n\nAn international survey by Morning Consult conducted between January 21 and 27, 2025, placed Claudia Sheinbaum's approval rating at 66% and Javier Milei's at 65%. A later report from April 30, 2025, citing Morning Consult data, showed Milei's approval at 61% and Sheinbaum's at 60%. In the January survey, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had the highest approval rating at 75%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The most recent data from the resolution source, Morning Consult (as of April 30, 2025), shows Javier Milei with a 61% approval rating and Claudia Sheinbaum with 60%. As Milei's rating is higher, the current status quo resolves the question as 'Yes'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Claudia Sheinbaum's high approval ratings in local Mexican polls (reported as high as 76-82%) translate into an increase in her Morning Consult score. Concurrently, the negative trend for Javier Milei indicated by local Argentinian polls (showing a net negative approval of -8%) is reflected in his next Morning Consult rating, causing his approval to drop below Sheinbaum's.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Polling inertia persists over the short timeframe. Milei's one-point lead from late April holds steady or widens slightly, as his base remains solid despite economic difficulties. Sheinbaum's rating remains stable or dips slightly, and she fails to close the narrow gap by the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans slightly towards 'Yes', primarily driven by the status quo from the designated resolution source. The most recent Morning Consult data from April 30, 2025, places Milei at 61% and Sheinbaum at 60%. With only about six weeks until the outcome is determined, this direct data point is the most powerful predictor. However, the probability is only moderately above 50% due to significant countervailing evidence. Local polling in Argentina from late April suggests a downward trend for Milei, with a net negative approval rating (-8%) and a majority feeling the economy has worsened. This indicates his support may be fragile. Conversely, local polls in Mexico show Sheinbaum with exceptionally high approval (76-82%), suggesting her Morning Consult figure of 60% may have room to grow. The forecast balances the hard data from the specific source against the trend data from other polls. It is not higher because Milei's one-point lead is razor-thin and his local polling trend is negative. It is not lower than 50% because overriding the most recent data from the specified source over such a short period would be imprudent. I would update towards 'No' if new Morning Consult data shows the gap has closed or if major negative economic news emerges from Argentina. I would update towards 'Yes' if Milei's administration presides over a notable economic success or if Sheinbaum is involved in a significant political scandal.",
