    "review": "Both forecasters correctly emphasize the narrow resolution sources (public S-1 or a specific Discord news/blog post) and the typical IPO cadence. The strongest additional point they raise is seasonality: for a September/October debut, companies often keep filings confidential until late summer, making a pre–July 1 public S-1 less likely. They also note that companies rarely blog about confidential submissions, which further reduces the chance that the blog will be the trigger. I find these arguments convincing and slightly underweighted in my initial take. The mention of leadership hires with IPO experience and an open-enough 2025 window is supportive but doesn’t overcome timing norms and the summer lull. Overall, their reasoning tightens the case for a modestly sub-35% probability.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~5.5 weeks, and the resolution requires a public S-1 or a specific company news post. The dominant path is a June S-1. While credible reports (banks engaged, 2025 target) show real intent, the median playbook for a fall IPO is to keep drafts confidential and go public closer to the roadshow, which—combined with the July–August lull—pushes the odds down for a pre–July 1 signal. Companies also rarely announce confidential submissions on their blogs, further lowering the likelihood that the blog serves as the catalyst. I previously had 35%; incorporating the seasonality/filing-timing emphasis and the narrow resolution sources, I edge down slightly. I would move up on credible reports of an imminent public S-1 or a company blog post acknowledging a confidential filing; I would move down on signs of timeline slippage or a risk-off market turn.",
