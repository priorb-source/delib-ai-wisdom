  "information": "The current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is Brooke Rollins, who was sworn in around February 2025. Secretary Rollins has expressed support for SNAP reforms as part of a 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative, which is also championed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In legislative developments, the House Budget Committee has cleared a Republican spending package that includes proposed cuts to SNAP and stricter work requirements. Separately, Secretary Rollins plans to announce a USDA reorganization plan and further staff reductions in late May 2025.\n\nSeveral states are pursuing federal waivers to restrict the use of SNAP benefits for certain items. Nebraska became the first state to receive a waiver to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks, with the ban taking effect on January 1, 2026. Following this, Idaho submitted a similar waiver on May 16, 2025, to ban soft drinks and candy, with a decision expected in the coming weeks. Arkansas is seeking USDA clearance to make candy and soda ineligible starting in July 2026, while also proposing to add rotisserie chicken to the list of eligible foods. Indiana is also pursuing similar restrictions.\n\nChanges to national SNAP eligibility rules require either a congressional amendment to the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 or a formal USDA rulemaking process. The Act broadly authorizes SNAP benefits for 'any food or food product intended for human consumption.' In the past, the USDA has rejected state waiver requests to restrict specific food items due to concerns about implementation challenges, costs, and the potential impact on recipients. According to the USDA, approximately 20% of all SNAP spending goes towards sugary drinks and snacks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks, from May 20, 2025 to the resolution date of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. As of May 5, 2025, the USDA's webpage for 'What Can SNAP Buy?' explicitly includes 'snack foods' as an eligible category.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The new USDA administration, under Secretary Brooke Rollins, makes a rapid, symbolic change to its public guidance. It orders the specific phrase 'snack foods' to be removed from the SNAP eligibility webpage to signal its new policy direction under the 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative, even before formal rules are changed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the new administration's stated intent to reform SNAP, the formal process of changing federal rules is slow. Due to bureaucratic inertia and the procedural requirements for rulemaking or legislation, no change is made to the specific text of the 'What Can SNAP Buy?' webpage by the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The core of this forecast hinges on the conflict between strong political will for change and the slow pace of government procedure. The new USDA Secretary has clearly signaled a desire to restrict SNAP purchases for items deemed unhealthy, aligning with state-level GOP initiatives. However, the timeline of roughly six weeks is extremely short for implementing such a policy change at the federal level. Changes to national SNAP eligibility require a formal USDA rulemaking process—which involves public comment periods and can take many months—or an act of Congress, which is even slower and more complex. The provided evidence regarding state waivers supports this view; Nebraska's approved waiver to ban soda will not take effect until January 2026, demonstrating the significant lead time required for even approved changes. While the administration's intent is clear, it is highly probable that the specific text on a USDA webpage will not be updated by July 1, 2025, simply because the underlying policy and legal framework will not have had time to change. My forecast is not higher than 90% because a new, motivated administration could make a purely symbolic change to the website text as a political statement, even if the enforceability of such a change is not yet in place. It is not lower because the procedural hurdles and bureaucratic inertia against such a rapid change are immense, making the status quo the most likely outcome in this short timeframe.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is Brooke Rollins, who was sworn in around February 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
