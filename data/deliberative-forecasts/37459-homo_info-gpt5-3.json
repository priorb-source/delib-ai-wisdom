    "review": "Both forecasters strengthen the No case with two incremental points I underweighted: (1) the streak of 9–10 consecutive quarters of net selling/cash build, implying a deliberate portfolio contraction; and (2) fresh color from the 2025 annual meeting about valuation discipline and a likely shrinking equity portfolio. Their emphasis on confidential treatment is aligned with my view, but the concrete Chubb precedent underscores that even if Berkshire were building a position, the Q1 13F might still not reveal it. I agree Alphabet/Meta are the only plausible Yes pathways; Microsoft remains optics-constrained, Nvidia/Tesla remain valuation/fit outliers. I find their reasoning largely convincing and more consistent with Berkshire’s recent behavior than my prior 17%.",
    "rationale": "Key updates after deliberation: \n- Process/behavioral base rate: The extended net seller pattern and record cash level suggest Berkshire is not in an expansionary mode for public equities. That lowers near-term odds of initiating a new mega-cap tech position that would show up in the 13F. \n- 2025 meeting guidance: Widely reported commentary about limited opportunities and a likely shrinking equity portfolio further tilts toward No in Q1. \n- Confidential treatment: While I noted this risk earlier, the Chubb example and the reminder that any ongoing accumulation could remain hidden make a visible Yes in this specific filing less likely. \n- Counterweights: Todd/Ted autonomy still leaves a nontrivial chance of a small Alphabet or Meta initiation that doesn’t require concealment, especially if they saw a brief valuation window in Q1. But early-2025 weakness was more apparent in April, partly outside the Q1 window, tempering this. \nNet effect: I lower my forecast from 17% to 12% to reflect stronger evidence of continued conservatism and the non-trivial probability that any build would be confidential, while preserving a modest chance via Alphabet/Meta.",
