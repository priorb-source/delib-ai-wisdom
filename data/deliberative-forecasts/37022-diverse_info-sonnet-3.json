    "review": "The other forecasters raise a critical issue I initially overlooked: definitional confusion about what Trading Economics tracks. Forecaster 3 cites total debt figures (5.51T UAH in 2023, 7T by end-2024) that are 3-4x higher than the February 2025 figure of 1.869T in my research assistant's report. This suggests Trading Economics tracks a subset—likely domestic government debt—not total state and state-guaranteed debt. Forecaster 2 correctly identifies this ambiguity as the key uncertainty. Forecaster 3 provides specific March 2025 data (16B UAH from IMF, 26B UAH from bonds = 42B total), which if applicable to the TE series would push it to 1.911T, well above the threshold. However, these flows might affect total debt without fully reflecting in the TE subset. Forecaster 2's point about FX revaluation from hryvnia depreciation (41.1 to 41.4 per USD adding 9-11B UAH) is valuable but only applies if the TE series includes foreign-currency debt. The most compelling argument is the combination of: (1) historical frequency showing 58% of months exceeded the required 30B increase, (2) wartime financing pressures maintaining upward trajectory, and (3) specific March inflows cited by Forecaster 3. My initial 43% was too anchored to the median/recent trend and insufficiently weighted the historical frequency and war context.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I underweighted the historical evidence that 7 of 12 months (58%) showed increases of 30B+ UAH, which alone suggests probability above 50%. The war context creates structural upward pressure on debt, and Forecaster 3's mention of 42B UAH in March inflows (IMF + domestic bonds) provides concrete evidence of debt growth that month. Even if not all flows hit the specific TE series, the magnitude suggests the threshold was likely crossed. Forecaster 2's FX revaluation point adds another 9-11B toward the target. My previous forecast was too conservative by focusing on median trends rather than the full distribution and context. However, I'm not moving to Forecaster 3's 99% because: (1) the definitional ambiguity creates real uncertainty about whether all cited flows appear in the TE series, (2) my research assistant's data showed recent momentum (18.5B Jan-Feb increase) was below the required 31B, and (3) we lack confirmed March figures for the specific TE metric. The evidence supports moving substantially upward from 43%, but maintaining some skepticism about whether the specific threshold was crossed.",
