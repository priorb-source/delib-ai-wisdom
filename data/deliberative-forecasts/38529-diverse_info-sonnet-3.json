    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I underweighted. Forecaster 2 provides crucial details about RCV vulnerability - with 9 candidates and Cuomo being polarizing, second-choice transfer patterns could be decisive even if he leads on first choices. The specific information about outside spending ($2.5M), targeted outreach, and the Marist RCV simulation winning in round 5 is helpful context. Forecaster 3's emphasis on Cuomo as a 'uniquely vulnerable frontrunner' due to scandal baggage is well-taken, as is the significance of AOC's endorsement for Mamdani in mobilizing progressives. Both forecasters (56% and 60%) are substantially lower than my initial 77%, citing similar concerns about RCV dynamics, momentum, and Cuomo's high negatives creating a ceiling. However, I note they may be overweighting these concerns relative to the polling data - even the tightest poll shows a 16-point lead with only 15 days remaining, and the Marist simulation specifically modeled RCV showing Cuomo winning. The narrowing trend is real but overcoming a double-digit deficit in two weeks requires more than momentum - it requires a dramatic shift or major error in polling models.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast downward but not as low as my peers. Key updates to my thinking: (1) RCV vulnerability is more serious than I initially weighted - in a 9-candidate field, Cuomo's polarizing nature and weak second-choice appeal among progressives could eliminate his first-round lead; (2) The high negatives and scandal baggage create a meaningful ceiling; (3) Progressive energy with AOC's endorsement and potential coordinated transfer voting poses real risk. However, I'm not dropping to 56-60% because: (1) The polling lead remains substantial across five polls (16-32 points); (2) The Marist poll explicitly simulated RCV and projected Cuomo winning in round 5 with over 50%; (3) Only 15 days remain - momentum matters but time is limited; (4) Cuomo's advantages in name recognition, resources, and appeal to reliable older/moderate voters in a June primary are real. The base rate for frontrunners maintaining double-digit leads this close to election day is high. I'm splitting the difference between my initial confidence and my peers' caution.",
