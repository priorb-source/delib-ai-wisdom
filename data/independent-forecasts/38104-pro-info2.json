  "information": "A multi-agency manhunt is underway, involving over 200 officers from local, state, and federal bodies, including the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). The reward for information leading to the capture of the two remaining fugitives has been increased to $50,000 per person, with funds contributed by Crimestoppers, the FBI, and the ATF. As of late May 2025, law enforcement had received nearly 700 tips from the public. In connection with the escape and subsequent aid to the fugitives, at least 14 accomplices have been arrested, including family members of one of the escapees.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (from May 30, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The current trend is a rapid and successful multi-agency manhunt that has already recaptured 8 of the 10 escapees within two weeks. The status quo suggests the remaining two will also be captured soon.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the two remaining fugitives, possibly the most resourceful of the group, leverages a sophisticated support network to either go deep underground locally or flee the country, successfully evading the massive manhunt until after the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sustained pressure from the 200+ officer task force, combined with a crucial tip from the public incentivized by the $50,000 reward, leads to the location and capture of the final two fugitives well before the end of June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the overwhelming success rate and intensity of the current manhunt. The fact that 8 out of 10 escapees were recaptured within the first 14 days is a powerful leading indicator. The operation's scale, involving over 200 officers from multiple federal and state agencies (FBI, U.S. Marshals, ATF), demonstrates a high level of priority and resources that is difficult for fugitives to evade for long. Furthermore, the authorities are actively dismantling the escapees' support networks, with 14 accomplices already arrested. This severely limits the fugitives' ability to hide, resupply, or move. The high reward ($50,000 per fugitive) significantly increases the probability of public cooperation, and the 700 tips already received show this is effective. With over a month remaining until the deadline, the combination of immense law enforcement pressure, diminishing support for the fugitives, and public financial incentives makes a successful recapture highly probable. The forecast is not higher because the two remaining individuals may be the most difficult to catch, and there is a non-trivial chance they have already left the immediate search area or have found a secure, long-term hideout. The probability is not lower because the resources, momentum, and historical success rates of such large-scale manhunts are strongly in favor of law enforcement. I would increase my probability upon news of one of the remaining two being captured. I would decrease my probability if two weeks pass with no credible leads, suggesting the trail has gone cold.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in the [2025 New Orleans jailbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Orleans_jailbreak) have been either recaptured or killed, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions). If any are still at large on July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA multi-agency manhunt is underway, involving over 200 officers from local, state, and federal bodies, including the FBI, U.S. Marshals, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
