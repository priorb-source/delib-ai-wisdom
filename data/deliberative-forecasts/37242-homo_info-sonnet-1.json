    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises an absolutely critical point I completely missed: the Easter timing effect. Easter 2025 fell on April 20, meaning the entire Easter holiday travel period occurred in April 2025, whereas Easter 2024 was March 31, placing most Easter travel in late March 2024. This is a significant structural calendar advantage for April 2025 that should materially boost year-over-year comparisons. This is perhaps the single most important factor for this question. The Q1 2025 growth data (3.6% YoY) also reinforces the positive momentum trend I noted. Forecaster 3 introduces new information about a power outage on April 28, but correctly notes its limited impact - occurring only in the final 3 days of the month with indirect effects on the Canaries. This seems like a minor negative factor compared to the much larger Easter timing advantage.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I significantly underweighted the Easter calendar effect, which Forecaster 2 correctly identified as crucial. Having the entire Easter travel period in April 2025 versus having most of it in March 2024 represents a predictable, quantifiable advantage that should strongly favor April 2025 outperforming April 2024. Combined with: (1) the 7-10% airline capacity increases across multiple carriers that I originally noted, (2) the Q1 2025 growth momentum showing consistent 2.2% increases in February and March, (3) the minimal exposure to US tourism concerns, and (4) no major disruptions beyond a limited 3-day power outage impact, the evidence overwhelmingly points toward continued growth. The status quo of year-over-year tourism growth, reinforced by structural calendar advantages and demonstrated capacity expansion, makes a decline quite unlikely. I'm updating my forecast downward from 20% to 15%, acknowledging the Easter timing advantage while maintaining modest caution for unforeseen factors or data revisions.",
