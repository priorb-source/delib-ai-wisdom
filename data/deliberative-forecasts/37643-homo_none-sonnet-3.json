    "review": "All three forecasters reached remarkably similar conclusions (15-20%), identifying the same key constraints: the 48-day timeframe is extremely short for major policy implementation, the objective is currently 'in progress' (meaning the status quo is No), and terminating PSLF faces substantial procedural and legal hurdles. Forecaster 2 and 3 both emphasized an important uncertainty I should weight more heavily: the tracker maintainers' threshold for marking something 'complete.' They might require full implementation or might accept official announcements. Given that Keep_Track is a community-led accountability project from a likely critical perspective of the administration, they probably have high standards requiring meaningful implementation rather than just announcements. Forecaster 2's point about administrative vs. legislative pathways is well-taken - while legislative action is essentially impossible in 48 days, aggressive administrative action is theoretically possible but would face immediate legal challenges that could prevent the tracker from recognizing completion. The 'in progress' designation is a double-edged signal: it shows some momentum exists, but also confirms that completion hasn't been achieved yet despite presumably months of effort since the administration began. None of us have information about specific recent actions toward PSLF termination, which in itself is telling - if major termination steps were imminent or recently completed, we would likely have seen news coverage.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm convinced the 15-20% range is appropriate, and I'm inclined to move slightly lower within that range. The binding constraint is really the 48-day timeframe combined with the high bar for 'complete' status. Even if dramatic administrative actions were announced tomorrow, the tracker maintainers would likely wait to see if those actions survive legal challenges and achieve meaningful implementation before marking the objective complete. The 'in progress' status suggests momentum but also confirms that after months of potential effort, termination hasn't been achieved. The most plausible Yes scenario requires: (1) aggressive administrative action taken very soon, (2) minimal legal obstacles or rapid legal resolution, and (3) tracker maintainers using a lenient standard for completion. Each of these has low individual probability, making their conjunction quite unlikely. I'm updating slightly downward from 20% to 17%, giving slightly more weight to the timeframe constraint while still acknowledging the non-zero probability that administrative actions in progress could culminate in recognized completion within 48 days.",
