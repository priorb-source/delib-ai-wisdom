    "review": "Both forecasters raise compelling arguments I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 3's revelation that WorldAtlas is Canadian-based is crucial - this fundamentally changes the analysis since a Canadian company has no obligation or incentive to follow US executive orders. Forecaster 2's distinction between article titles and the actual map page (the resolution target) is also important, as maps are more static assets requiring deliberate updates. Both emphasize the strong historical inertia of geographical names and international non-recognition by the IHO. However, Forecaster 2 appropriately notes that Google Maps has already implemented this change for US users, which I underweighted. Forecaster 3's 2% seems too extreme given Google's actual implementation and the dual-naming option, while Forecaster 2's 15% seems more reasonable but perhaps still slightly high given the Canadian ownership and 3.5 months of inaction.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 25% to 10%. The key factor driving this update is learning that WorldAtlas is Canadian-based, not US-based. This significantly reduces the likelihood they would follow a US executive order, especially one that lacks international recognition and faces opposition from Mexico. The distinction between their article titles (which acknowledge the alternative name) and their static map pages (the actual resolution criteria) is also important - maps require more deliberate updates and editorial decisions. The 3.5 months of inaction since the executive order, despite their demonstrated awareness, is strong evidence for maintaining the status quo. However, I'm not going as low as 2% because: (1) Google Maps has actually implemented this change for US users, demonstrating this is within the realm of possibility for major platforms, (2) the resolution criteria allow for dual naming, which is a much lower bar than exclusive adoption, (3) there are still 54 days remaining, and (4) their article acknowledgment shows editorial flexibility. My 10% forecast reflects very strong status quo bias tempered by non-zero probability of a dual-label compromise update.",
