    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a concrete claim: the current count on flightsfrom.com is 30. That’s the most actionable new input here. If that 30 already reflects loaded summer schedules (as flightsfrom typically does), then the room to add new destinations before July 1 is limited, which would dampen the odds of clearing >31. Their framing that only two net additions are needed and that July 1 sits at the start of peak season is reasonable, and their 55% feels coherent if the 30 baseline is correct but not exhaustive of late-adding seasonal routes.\n\nForecaster 3’s main contribution is emphasizing that by late May, summer schedules are largely set—so the present listing likely already embeds most July seasonal routes. That strengthens the case that a low current count is informative and lowers upside potential. They also correctly downweight the Shafaq article as weak evidence and highlight status quo inertia.\n\nNet: I find F2’s specific baseline (30) a meaningful update, and F3’s scheduling-timing point persuasive. The key uncertainty is whether the 30 figure already includes July-active seasonal Turkish resort routes and any resumed Levant/Iran links. If it does, my prior 60% was too high. If it doesn’t, the threshold is likely to be exceeded. Given typical flightsfrom methodology, I put some weight on the former and trim my estimate.",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution is ~5–6 weeks. July is peak season, which is usually favorable for reaching the threshold. Historically, EBL’s summer network can land around the low-30s when counting Turkey (IST/SAW plus resorts like AYT/BJV/DLM/ADB), the Gulf (DXB/SHJ/AUH/DOH/KWI/BAH/MCT), domestic Iraq (BGW/NJF/BSR), Iran (IKA/MHD/others, variable), and Levant/Egypt (AMM/BEY/CAI/HBE). That structural picture supports a slight lean to Yes.\n\nHowever, the reported current count of 30 on flightsfrom is important. If that already reflects loaded summer schedules (common by late May), additional destinations before July 1 are uncertain, and downside risks (any suspensions around Iran/Levant/Saudi or charters not being counted) could keep it at or below 31. The upside case is that 1–3 seasonal Turkish resort routes or a resumed Levant/Iran link are not yet reflected and push it to 32–34.\n\nI’m reducing my forecast from 60% to 55% to account for the likelihood that the present listing already captures most July flying, while still giving a slight edge to Yes given how close the threshold is and the seasonality tailwind.",
