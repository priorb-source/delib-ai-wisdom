    "review": "My initial forecast of 20% was slightly higher than my colleagues', who both landed at 15%. I find their reasoning highly convincing and am therefore adjusting my forecast downwards to align with theirs. All three of us identified the short five-week timeline and the power of the status quo as the primary drivers for a low probability. However, my peers raised two specific, compelling points I had not sufficiently weighted. First, as Forecaster 3 noted, a review of O'Rourke's past campaign launches shows his more recent 2022 gubernatorial announcement was significantly later (~12 months pre-election) than his 2018 Senate announcement (~20 months pre-election). An announcement before July 1, 2025 (~16 months pre-election) is plausible, but the trend points towards a later decision. Second, Forecaster 2 rightly emphasized that the July 1 deadline is arbitrary from a campaign strategy perspective; there is no filing deadline or other milestone that creates an urgent need for O'Rourke to announce within this specific window. These two arguments strongly suggest that even if he does decide to run, there is no compelling reason for him to do so in the next five weeks.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from my fellow forecasters, I am lowering my probability from 20% to 15%. My initial reasoning remains valid: the path of inertia is for O'Rourke not to run, and launching a statewide campaign on such short notice without any visible preparatory steps (FEC filings, staff hiring, etc.) is unlikely. However, my colleagues’ arguments have convinced me that my initial forecast was slightly too high. \n\nThe most persuasive new point was the historical context of O'Rourke's own announcement timelines. His decision to launch his 2022 gubernatorial campaign just 12 months before the election establishes a clear precedent for him taking his time and announcing much later than the July 1, 2025 deadline. This precedent, combined with the psychological weight of three prior losses likely encouraging a more cautious approach, makes a rushed announcement in the next five weeks less probable. \n\nFurthermore, the observation that the July 1 deadline has no inherent strategic value to the campaign is critical. Without an external forcing function, O'Rourke has the flexibility to make his decision on his own timeline, which, based on his most recent campaign, would likely be later in 2025 or even early 2026. While the opportunity presented by the Republican primary is real, it doesn't create urgency for an announcement specifically *now*. These factors collectively strengthen the case for a 'No' resolution, warranting a modest downward adjustment to my forecast.",
