    "review": "Both forecasters align with my core take: outstanding arrears (~€2b), weak Bulgarian leverage, and ongoing talks aimed at renegotiation make near‑term cancellation unlikely. New useful emphasis from them: (1) arbitration risk and likely adverse outcome for Bulgaria if it unilaterally cancels; (2) persistence of the contract through nearly a year of non‑payment as evidence of a strong status quo bias; (3) the debt acting as a de facto blocker to consensual termination. I partially disagree with the weight they place on the “insufficient time for a complex cancellation process” argument: for this market, a unilateral announcement by either side suffices, so procedural length is less constraining. That said, their highlighting of intense domestic political pressure in Bulgaria marginally increases the tail risk of a unilateral political move.",
    "rationale": "Key drivers remain unchanged: BOTAS holds leverage via arrears and take‑or‑pay terms; Bulgaria lacks the fiscal capacity to clear the debt; both sides publicly emphasize partnership/renegotiation; and there are no credible reports of imminent termination steps. The fact the deal has survived almost a year of non‑payment suggests BOTAS prefers to keep claims alive and extract concessions rather than terminate and crystallize a dispute. A Yes outcome would most likely come from a politically driven unilateral cancellation by Sofia or, less likely, a BOTAS termination for breach—both possible on short notice, given the resolution hinges on an announcement. However, Turkey’s stance against cancellation and Bulgaria’s legal/financial exposure make such moves costly and therefore improbable within the next ~3.5 weeks. Net: I slightly nudge up my probability to reflect the political‑pressure tail risk highlighted by others, but the base case remains No. Triggers that would move me up: credible leaks of cabinet approval/termination notice, BOTAS issuing an event‑of‑default termination, or public declaration that talks collapsed. Down: any interim standstill, payment plan, or joint statement on progress/continuation.",
