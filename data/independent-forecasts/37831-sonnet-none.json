    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the decree dissolving all political parties remains in effect",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The military government maintains its May 13, 2025 decree dissolving all political parties, citing national security concerns, the need for political reform, or transition requirements. Despite potential domestic opposition or international criticism, the government does not reverse course within the 40-day window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Severe domestic unrest, immediate international sanctions, or pressure from regional bodies like ECOWAS forces a quick reversal. Alternatively, the government reveals the decree was meant as a temporary measure and announces a reversal as part of a broader transition plan. This would require unusually rapid political developments.",
    "rationale": "This forecast strongly favors the status quo (No outcome) for several compelling reasons. First, the decree is extremely recent - issued only 9 days ago on May 13, 2025. Governments, particularly military ones, rarely reverse major political decisions within weeks as it signals weakness and poor planning. Second, Mali has been under military rule since coups in 2020-2021, and military governments typically consolidate power rather than quickly liberalize. They are also less responsive to domestic political pressure than democratic systems. Third, the 40-day timeframe until July 1 is remarkably short for meaningful pressure to build. Domestic opposition needs time to organize, international sanctions take time to implement and have effect, and diplomatic pressure campaigns require coordination. My research assistant provided no additional information suggesting reversal plans or building pressure. Why not higher than 7%? There is no evidence of: plans for reversal, significant domestic unrest, imminent sanctions, or internal military disagreement. The decree appears to be a deliberate consolidation of power. Why not lower? I avoid extremely low probabilities (under 5%) for political events in a 40-day window because unexpected developments can occur. Mali has faced international pressure before regarding democratic transitions, and rapid policy reversals, while rare, are not impossible. To update upward, I would need evidence of: immediate severe sanctions being imposed, massive domestic protests, announced plans for reversal, or credible reporting that the decree was meant as temporary. To update downward further, I would need evidence the military government is doubling down on the ban or explicitly rejecting calls for reversal.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Mali reverse its decision to dissolve all political parties?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mali's Military Government Shuts Down All Political Parties](https://www.legit.ng/world/africa/1654992-malis-military-government-shuts-political-parties/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the government of Mali announces a reversal of its May 13, 2025 presidential decree dissolving all political parties in the country.\n\nA partial reversal, such as allowing the reinstatement of a limited number of parties, will only count as long as new parties are generally allowed to be formed again.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
