    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I share optimism about the May 1 events but they reference large March 2025 protests with hundreds of thousands of participants that my research assistant didn't mention - this is a critical information discrepancy that requires skepticism. If such massive protests occurred, they should have been in my briefing. Forecaster 3 provides important counterarguments I underweighted: (1) the double hurdle of protests occurring AND being documented by the tracker, (2) government suppression capabilities demonstrated through bans and preemptive arrests, (3) the Saraçhane protests being small-scale (14 arrests), and (4) authorized marches may not qualify as 'protests' in the tracker's methodology. The tension between Forecaster 2's high confidence and Forecaster 3's skepticism, combined with gaps in my information, suggests the truth lies between their forecasts.",
    "rationale": "Updating down from 55% to 42% for several reasons. First, Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes that authorized Labor Day marches (even with 65,000 combined participants) may be classified as commemorative events rather than protests by the Global Protest Tracker's methodology. The unauthorized demonstrations near Taksim Square that resulted in 384 detentions likely had fewer than 10,000 participants individually. Second, the government's demonstrated suppression capacity (52,000 police deployed, preemptive bans on Taksim demonstrations) creates real barriers to mobilizing 10,000+ participants in unauthorized protests. Third, I cannot verify Forecaster 2's claims about massive March protests - if they occurred at the scale described, my research assistant would likely have mentioned them. Fourth, the 10,000+ threshold with documentation requirement is indeed a double hurdle. However, I'm not going as low as Forecaster 3's 23% because: (1) severe economic conditions (48.6% inflation) create genuine grievance potential, (2) 55 days provides meaningful opportunity for catalyzing events, (3) Turkey has historical precedent for mass mobilization, and (4) the May 1 events demonstrate ongoing protest activity even if classification is uncertain. The probability centers on whether the tracker will classify the May 1 events as qualifying protests or whether another large protest emerges in the remaining timeframe.",
