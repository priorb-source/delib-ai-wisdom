  "information": "The recent rise in jobless claims was not uniform across the country. The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending May 31 were in Michigan, Nebraska, California, Florida, and Virginia. The largest decreases were reported in Massachusetts, Illinois, Texas, Washington, and New York. Several major corporations have announced layoffs in 2025, including Procter & Gamble, Microsoft, Citigroup, Walmart, Meta, and Disney.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days. The data for the week ending June 21, 2025, is scheduled to be released on Thursday, June 26, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Based on the reported recent rise in claims and announced corporate layoffs, the status quo suggests the labor market is softening. If this trend continues for the next two weeks, claims would likely exceed 220,000.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recent increase in claims proves to be a temporary blip driven by one-off events. Strong hiring in other sectors quickly absorbs newly laid-off workers, and the large decreases seen in states like New York and Texas become the dominant trend, pushing the national figure below the 220,000 threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The wave of announced layoffs from major corporations like Microsoft, Meta, and Walmart continues to process through the system. The weakening trend accelerates, spreading to more states and overwhelming any regional pockets of strength, causing initial claims to rise well above 220,000.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the current trajectory of the labor market as suggested by the research report. The two most influential factors are the 'recent rise in jobless claims' and the list of major corporations that have announced layoffs in 2025. These signals point towards a cooling labor market, making it more probable that claims will be elevated. The 220,000 threshold is a key level, and the current momentum appears to be heading towards crossing it. The layoffs at large, national companies (Microsoft, Walmart, Citigroup, etc.) suggest a broad-based trend rather than a localized issue, despite the reported decreases in some states like Texas and New York. I am weighting the announced layoffs and the recent upward trend as the primary drivers.\n\nMy probability is not higher because weekly jobless claims data is notoriously volatile. A single week's figure can be influenced by administrative issues, holidays, or other noise. Furthermore, the report indicates a mixed picture, with several large states showing decreases in claims, which could provide a significant offset and keep the national number just below the threshold.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the evidence for a softening labor market is substantial. Ignoring the combination of a recent upward trend and a slate of high-profile layoffs would be contrary to a data-driven approach. For the outcome to be No, we would need to see a sharp and immediate reversal of the current trend, which seems unlikely in the next two weeks.\n\nI would increase my probability if the next weekly report (for the week ending June 14) also comes in high or if there are further significant layoff announcements. I would decrease my probability if the next report shows a sharp drop in claims or if there is news of unexpectedly strong hiring booms in major industries.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 exceed 220,000?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer. The claim requests a determination of basic eligibility for the Unemployment Insurance program.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 is greater than 220,000 according to [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA).&#x20;\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe recent rise in jobless claims was not uniform across the country. The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending May 31 were in Michigan, Nebraska, California, Florida, and Virginia. The largest decreases were reported in Massachusetts, Illinois, Texas, Washington, and New York. Several major corporations have announced layoffs in 2025, including Procter & Gamble, Microsoft, Citigroup, Walmart, Meta, and Disney.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
