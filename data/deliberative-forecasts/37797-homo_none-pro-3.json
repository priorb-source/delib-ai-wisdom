    "review": "The other two forecasters provide analyses that are in strong alignment with my own. We all agree on the fundamental drivers of this forecast: the high institutional inertia of the FATF, the extreme unlikelihood of removing North Korea, Iran, or Myanmar, and the fact that the only plausible route to a 'Yes' outcome is the addition of a new jurisdiction from the grey list. We all identify this as a rare event with a high threshold. The only substantive difference is the slight variation in the final probability assigned to this low-probability event, with Forecaster 3 at 10% and Forecaster 2 and myself at 15%. This minor difference reflects a subjective judgment on the magnitude of the tail risk rather than a disagreement on the underlying facts or reasoning.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other experts' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 15%. The deliberation process has strongly reinforced my initial reasoning. There is a clear consensus that the status quo is the most probable outcome. The key question is precisely how to quantify the small chance of an addition to the list.\n\nWhile Forecaster 3's argument for 10% is sound and emphasizes the high bar for additions, a brief review of the historical base rate seems to support a slightly higher probability. In the last five years, covering roughly 15 FATF Plenary meetings, there have been at least two additions (Iran was re-added in February 2020 and Myanmar was added in October 2022). This suggests a historical frequency of approximately 2-in-15, or about 13%. \n\nThis simple base rate calculation suggests that my initial forecast of 15% is a reasonable quantification of the risk, accounting for the infrequent but not impossible event of a grey-listed jurisdiction being escalated to the black list. The reasoning from both other forecasters confirms that this is the primary scenario to watch, and I believe 15% accurately reflects its likelihood.",
