  "information": "Brent Metz, a 39-year-old town councilman in Mountain View, Colorado, pleaded not guilty to felony charges related to the shooting of a 17-year-old high school student in September 2024. According to investigators, Metz shot the teen in the face while the teen was sitting in his car outside Metz's home, where he had been trying to take homecoming dance pictures. A Jefferson County Sheriff’s spokesperson stated that there was no indication the teen intended to commit any crime. Metz took a leave of absence from the council after the shooting.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 days (election May 20, 2025; unofficial results likely that night or within 1–2 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Metz is recalled and does not retain his seat",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Turnout in the small special election is driven by recall supporters galvanized by the shooting incident; a majority votes to remove Metz, and a successor is selected on the same ballot.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the controversy, a majority votes against the recall (or turnout skews heavily toward Metz’s supporters), allowing him to retain his seat.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and context: Per the assistant’s research, Metz pleaded not guilty to felony charges after allegedly shooting a 17-year-old in the face while the teen sat in a car outside Metz’s home; law enforcement has said there was no indication of criminal intent by the teen. Metz took a leave of absence. Local coverage is highly salient and negative. The recall election is scheduled for May 20, 2025.\n- Base rates: Municipal recalls that reach the ballot tend to succeed more often than not (roughly a majority, often around the 60–70% range in various datasets), with success rates higher when the triggering incident is a serious scandal. Small-town special elections typically feature low turnout where motivated opposition has an edge.\n- Status quo weighting: Nothing in the public narrative has shifted toward exoneration or mitigation; the criminal case is unresolved. The default trajectory is that opponents remain more energized than supporters, making “recall succeeds” the status quo outcome.\n- Factors pushing toward No (recall succeeds): Serious, emotive incident involving a teen; negative and ongoing media attention; unresolved felony charges; Metz’s leave of absence signaling reduced capacity; organized opponents already met the signature bar; low-turnout dynamics favor motivated recall voters.\n- Factors pushing toward Yes (he retains): Very small electorate means personal networks can matter; some voters may view recall as premature before trial and default to due process; Colorado’s mail-ballot context can boost overall turnout and dampen the anti-incumbent edge if Metz organizes effectively; if trusted local figures or institutions publicly back him, that could sway enough voters.\n- Why not higher: The severity and optics of the incident, combined with recall base rates and small-town mobilization dynamics, make retention unlikely absent new exculpatory developments or unusually strong GOTV for Metz.\n- Why not lower: Small electorates are volatile; even a few dozen votes could swing the result. If Metz has strong neighborhood-level support, or if ballot return data indicates higher-than-expected turnout from supportive demographics, he could survive.\n- What would move me up: Credible local polling showing the recall trailing; visible endorsements from respected local leaders; robust pro-Metz field effort (canvassing/mailers); ballot return stats suggesting high turnout among older or historically pro-incumbent voters; any legal development substantially weakening the case against him.\n- What would move me down: Additional negative revelations; victim/family public engagement boosting recall sentiment; endorsements for recall from town leaders; ballot return stats indicating strong anti-incumbent precincts turning out disproportionately.",
