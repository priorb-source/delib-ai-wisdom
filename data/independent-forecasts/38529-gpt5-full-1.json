  "information": "A series of polls conducted between March and June 2025 show Andrew Cuomo as the frontrunner in the Democratic primary. A SurveyUSA poll in May showed Cuomo as the first choice for 43% of likely Democratic voters, with Zohran Mamdani at 11%. A Marist poll from early May placed Cuomo at 37% and Mamdani at 18%, and a simulation showed Cuomo surpassing the 50% threshold to win in the fifth round of ranked-choice voting. An Emerson College/PIX11/The Hill poll from late May placed Cuomo at 39% to Mamdani's 23%. Earlier polls from March by Honan Strategy Group and Data for Progress also showed Cuomo leading Mamdani with 41% to 18% and 39% to 15%, respectively.\n\nAndrew Cuomo has secured endorsements from several key groups and individuals. These include Luis Dávila Pernas, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico; Latin music star Marc Anthony; and several Orthodox Jewish communities, including the Bobov Hasidic movement, the Crown Heights community, and the Far Rockaway Jewish Alliance. In contrast, Cuomo's primary opponent, Zohran Mamdani, has received the endorsement of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nFinancially, Cuomo's campaign is supported by the New York Apartment Association, which plans to spend $2.5 million on his behalf. His campaign has also run ads targeting Hispanic voters, including a $100,000 ad buy related to the Puerto Rican Day Parade. In a recent debate, all nine Democratic candidates, including Cuomo and Mamdani, were united in their pledge to protect immigrants and maintain New York's status as a sanctuary city. In a separate strategic move, Cuomo announced the founding of his own independent party, 'Fight and Deliver', while remaining in the Democratic primary race.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2–4 weeks (primary is June 24, 2025; RCV/absentee counting may take up to ~1–2 additional weeks for a presumptive call).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Cuomo wins the Democratic primary and is called the presumptive nominee after RCV tabulation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A late progressive surge plus RCV consolidation against Cuomo: Mamdani closes to within single digits, scoops up most second/third choices from other progressives and anti-Cuomo voters, turnout skews young/left, and Cuomo’s transfers are weak, allowing Mamdani to overtake in late RCV rounds. Alternatively, a late-breaking scandal or eligibility/legal issue depresses Cuomo’s support enough to prevent a call.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cuomo enters with ~40% first-choice support, leads every round, and gains enough transfers from eliminated moderates/establishment-aligned candidates to clear 50% by rounds 4–6; credible outlets call him the presumptive nominee.",
    "rationale": "- Polling: Multiple independent polls from March–late May show Cuomo consistently leading the field with high-30s to low-40s first-choice support (SurveyUSA 43–11 over Mamdani; Marist 37–18; Emerson/PIX11/The Hill 39–23; earlier HSG 41–18; DFP 39–15). A Marist RCV simulation has Cuomo surpassing 50% in the 5th round. That pattern across pollsters and time supports a status quo in which Cuomo wins.\n- Endorsements and coalition: Cuomo has visible support in cohesive, high-turnout blocs (several Orthodox Jewish communities) and targeted Hispanic outreach (incl. Marc Anthony backing, Puerto Rican Day Parade ad buy). Significant outside spending (NY Apartment Association ~$2.5M) and name recognition add to his advantage. Mamdani has AOC’s endorsement and progressive energy, but the current gap remains sizable.\n- Mechanics of RCV: Leaders near ~40% first-choice typically have a strong path, especially if moderate/establishment voters coalesce via transfers. The Marist simulation showing Cuomo clearing 50% in round 5 specifically mitigates the key downside risk that he is a weak second-choice recipient.\nWhy not higher: \n- RCV volatility and anti-Cuomo sentiment could allow a late coalescence against him; a polarized figure can underperform on transfers.\n- Momentum risk: Some polls imply Mamdani gaining; a late surge, major endorsements (e.g., big unions), or a damaging late story for Cuomo could narrow or flip RCV dynamics.\n- Turnout uncertainty: Low-turnout primaries can be sensitive to mobilization by energized progressives.\nWhy not lower:\n- The lead is consistent, cross-pollster, and fairly large. Resource and organizational advantages plus bloc endorsements favor Cuomo. At ~40% first-choice, he doesn’t need many transfers to win, and simulations indicate he gets them.\nWhat would move me up: New high-quality polls showing Cuomo ≥45% first-choice and/or favorable RCV simulations; major establishment/union endorsements for Cuomo; evidence of strong early vote or field performance in Cuomo-leaning areas.\nWhat would move me down: High-quality polls showing Mamdani within single digits or ahead in simulated final RCV rounds; a wave of progressive and union endorsements for Mamdani; a significant late scandal or legal complication for Cuomo; evidence of a pronounced youth/progressive turnout spike.",
