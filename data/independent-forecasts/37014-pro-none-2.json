    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1-2 weeks. The election is on May 1st, 2025, and results are typically declared within a couple of days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Conservative Party currently holds a large majority on Kent County Council and has dominated Kentish politics for decades. The status quo would be for them to remain the largest party, even if their majority is reduced.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative vote in their traditional heartlands proves more resilient than polls suggest. Tactical voting from Labour and Liberal Democrat supporters consolidates the anti-Reform vote in key divisions, preventing Reform from winning marginals. As a result, the Conservatives lose their majority but hang on to win the most seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The national collapse in the Conservative vote, as seen in national polling, translates directly to the local level in Kent. A large plurality of former Conservative voters switch to Reform UK, while the centre-left vote remains split between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. This allows Reform to win a large number of seats with less than 50% of the vote in each, making them the largest party on the council.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily driven by the significant evidence of a national political realignment away from the Conservatives, with Reform UK as a major beneficiary. The specific Electoral Calculus poll cited in the background information, which predicts a Reform UK victory in Kent, is a powerful piece of evidence that cannot be ignored. Kent, as a socially conservative, pro-Brexit region, is fertile ground for Reform's platform, and this poll suggests the party is successfully capitalizing on dissatisfaction with the incumbent Conservatives. The status quo is a strong Conservative hold on the council, and normally I would weigh this heavily. However, the election is happening against a backdrop of a likely Conservative wipeout in a recent or concurrent general election, which severely weakens the incumbency advantage. The 'Yes' outcome is now more probable than not.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because local elections can defy national trends. Incumbent Conservative councillors may have strong personal followings that insulate them from the national swing. Furthermore, MRP polls for local elections are a relatively new science and may have a larger margin of error than national polls. The Conservative party machine on the ground in Kent is well-established and could outperform expectations in getting their vote out. A late swing back to the Conservatives from undecided voters, or effective tactical voting by opponents, could still prevent a Reform victory.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the evidence for a dramatic political shift is compelling. The Electoral Calculus prediction is not a marginal call; it predicts Reform taking control, indicating a substantial lead. Discounting this specific, data-driven forecast for the region in favour of historical precedent would be to ignore the most relevant available data. For me to lower my forecast, I would need to see new polling showing a significant narrowing of the gap or evidence of a major organizational failure in Reform UK's local campaign. Conversely, I would raise my probability if another poll from a different source corroborated the Electoral Calculus findings.",
