  "information": "Following his election win on April 28, 2025, Prime Minister Mark Carney presented a new, smaller cabinet of 29 ministers, down from 39 in the previous administration. Key figures such as François-Philippe Champagne (Finance) and Dominic LeBlanc (US Trade) were retained. Carney's government announced it would not table a full federal budget before the summer, opting for a fall economic statement instead. The new administration's immediate promises include a tax cut and the elimination of all inter-provincial trade barriers by July 1. Carney signed a symbolic decree to lower the first taxable income bracket from 15% to 14%, a measure requiring parliamentary approval. The Liberal party's platform includes additional spending that projects the national deficit for 2025-26 to be $62.3 billion Canadian dollars, an increase from the $42.2 billion forecast in December.\n\nThe relationship with the United States under President Donald Trump was a central theme of the recent Canadian election. Trump had made public remarks about absorbing Canada into the U.S. and imposed tariffs on Canadian goods. In response, Prime Minister Carney stated his government would 'relentlessly' protect Canadian sovereignty and work to define a new economic and security relationship with Washington. After the election, Carney met with Trump but did not secure a removal of the U.S. tariffs. Carney has stated he will maintain Canadian tariffs on U.S. products as long as American tariffs remain in place. The new Canadian cabinet has been explicitly tasked with focusing on Canada-U.S. relations and resolving trade disputes.\n\nPolling data from the period leading up to the April 28, 2025, snap election showed a significant shift in public opinion. After trailing by more than 20 points at the start of the year, the Liberal party under Mark Carney experienced a major comeback. A March 23 Ipsos poll reported Carney's approval rating at 48% with 30% disapproval, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre had 35% approval and 52% disapproval. Some outlets cited the same poll as showing Carney with a 71% approval rating. An Abacus Data poll from March 24 found the Conservatives with a national lead of 39% to 36% over the Liberals, but found Carney was the preferred choice for Prime Minister over Poilievre, 38% to 34%. The same poll reported that 77% of Canadians held a negative view of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Prime Minister Carney is in a post-election 'honeymoon' period, which typically involves high approval ratings. President Trump's approval ratings in the U.S. have historically been stable and below 50%. Therefore, it is most likely that Carney's current approval is higher.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Carney's honeymoon period ends abruptly due to an unpopular policy decision, an early scandal, or negative economic impacts from the U.S. trade dispute. Simultaneously, a 'rally around the flag' event in the U.S. or significant positive economic news pushes President Trump's approval rating a few points higher, causing it to equal or exceed Carney's by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Prime Minister Carney's post-election honeymoon continues through July 1, buoyed by popular initial moves like tax cuts and a firm stance against U.S. tariffs. President Trump's approval rating remains within its historically stable and polarized range, likely in the low-to-mid 40s, resulting in Carney maintaining a higher approval rating on the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the strong 'honeymoon' effect typically afforded to newly elected leaders. Prime Minister Mark Carney won an election on April 28, 2025, less than two months before the resolution date. This period is almost always characterized by high public approval. The research notes his pre-election approval rating was already strong at 48%, and victory itself would likely boost this further. His initial policy promises, such as a tax cut and a firm stance against President Trump's tariffs (a policy likely to be popular given that 77% of Canadians view Trump negatively), will probably sustain this high approval through the short period until July 1. Conversely, President Trump's approval ratings in the US have historically been very stable and highly polarized, rarely deviating far from the low-to-mid 40s. For this forecast to resolve 'No', Carney's approval would have to fall significantly while Trump's rises in just six weeks, an unlikely combination of events. The short timeframe heavily favors the status quo, which is a popular new Prime Minister versus a polarizing incumbent U.S. President. The probability is not higher than 85% to account for the possibility of a sudden, unforeseen scandal involving Carney's new government or a major international event that could unexpectedly rally support for President Trump. The probability is not lower because the combination of the honeymoon effect and the short timeframe creates a very strong baseline in favor of a 'Yes' outcome. I would lower my forecast if early polling in June showed Carney's support was unexpectedly soft, or if the trade dispute with the U.S. escalated in a way that was perceived as being mishandled by Carney. I would raise it if polling confirmed a very strong honeymoon period for Carney.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly.
