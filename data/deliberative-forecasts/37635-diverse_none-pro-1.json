    "review": "The other two forecasters provide sound reasoning that largely aligns with my own initial assessment, centering on the tension between the status quo (a 1-point lead for Milei) and the fragility of that lead over a short timeframe. Both correctly note Milei's higher volatility. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly compelling, adding two important nuances I hadn't sufficiently weighed: 1) The specific mechanics of the Morning Consult data as a slow-moving 7-day rolling average, which reinforces the power of inertia. 2) The explicit risk from rounding, in addition to the tie rule, which could erase a fractional lead. Their arguments for weighting the persistence of the status quo more heavily are convincing, especially given the short ~6-week resolution window.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 52% was anchored on the razor-thin 1-point margin, which I viewed as statistically insignificant and highly susceptible to noise, with the 'tie resolves as No' rule tipping the scales slightly from a 50/50 baseline. After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast. I was persuaded by their collective argument to place more weight on the inertia of the status quo, especially over this short 1.5-month period. Forecaster 3's point that Morning Consult's 7-day rolling averages tend to move slowly was a key factor; barring a significant event, large shifts are unlikely. While the risks of noise, rounding, and a tie are real and prevent a high-confidence forecast, the fact remains that Milei is currently ahead. The most probable single scenario is the persistence of this small lead. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast from 52% to 57% to better reflect the strong pull of the status quo, while still heavily discounting for the significant fragility of the lead.",
