    "review": "Both forecasters frame the tradeoff similarly to my prior view: extreme-low base and typical mean reversion vs. negative momentum (inflation/gas, market tone, policy noise). New/useful additions: emphasis on four straight monthly declines, rising unemployment expectations, and recent upside inflation surprises as sustaining headwinds; also the reminder that “unchanged” resolves No. I find these points directionally convincing—they modestly increase the chance of ≤50.8 despite the low bar. Their timing note (prelim before CPI, after jobs/Fed) aligns with my earlier view.",
    "rationale": "My prior 61% leaned on mean reversion from an extreme trough and the very low threshold (>50.8). I still think a small bounce is slightly more likely than not given typical month-to-month volatility and historical behavior after troughs. However, the added weight on momentum—four consecutive declines, high inflation expectations, seasonal gas price pressure, softening labor perceptions—argues for trimming the edge. Early-May news flow (jobs report, market tone) can sway the prelim, but absent a clear positive catalyst, the risk of flat/a bit lower is nontrivial, and “flat” resolves to No. Net: I keep a Yes-lean but shave a few points to reflect the persistence of negative narratives and the possibility that April’s shock bleeds into the early-May survey window.",
