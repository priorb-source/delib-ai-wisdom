    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental dynamics of this question, all arriving at very low probabilities for a reversal. We concur that the junta's authoritarian trajectory, the very recent timing of the decree, and the extremely short timeframe until resolution make the status quo (No outcome) overwhelmingly likely. \n\nForecaster 2's emphasis on the decree being only 9 days old is a sharp point that underscores the unlikeliness of a sudden U-turn. Forecaster 3 provided an excellent structural argument regarding Mali's limited external leverage due to its withdrawal from ECOWAS and realignment away from Western partners, which I had not explicitly considered but which strengthens the overall case. \n\nTheir reasoning is highly convincing and aligns with my own. The only significant difference is a minor calibration in the final probability, with both other forecasters slightly higher than my initial 5%. They attribute this to a general principle of avoiding extreme certainty in volatile political situations and the small possibility of tactical concessions or unforeseen shocks. This collective judgment suggests I may have slightly underestimated this residual uncertainty.",
    "rationale": "My core analysis—that the Malian junta is consolidating power and is extremely unlikely to reverse a major, recent decree within weeks—has been reinforced by the other forecasters' arguments. Their points about the decree's recency and Mali's weakened susceptibility to foreign pressure have strengthened my conviction in a 'No' outcome. \n\nHowever, I am making a small upward adjustment to my forecast, from 5% to 7%. This change is not due to any new evidence suggesting a reversal is more likely, but rather to align my forecast with the group's consensus on the level of irreducible uncertainty. Both other experts, with strong reasoning, landed slightly higher (7% and 8%), accounting for the small but real possibility of an unexpected political shock or a tactical pivot by the regime. I find this caution prudent. While I still believe a reversal is highly improbable, I am increasing my forecast to better reflect the small 'tail risk' in a volatile political environment, as highlighted by my colleagues' analyses. The fundamental rationale for expecting a 'No' outcome remains unchanged.",
