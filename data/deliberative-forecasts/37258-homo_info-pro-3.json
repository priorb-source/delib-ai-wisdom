    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus, with all three forecasters arriving at an identical initial forecast of 5%. I found the reasoning of the other two forecasters highly convincing, as they introduced critical points I had not fully weighed. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the ongoing SNP leadership transition is a major factor; a new leader is far more likely to focus on internal party consolidation than to initiate a high-risk, constitutionally fraught referendum announcement. Forecaster 3 provided crucial evidence regarding the Scottish Government's own stated priorities (economy, public services) and the strategic focus shifting towards the 2026 Holyrood elections. These arguments provide a compelling 'why' behind the 'what,' explaining the strategic rationale for inaction, which goes beyond the short-term constraints I initially focused on.",
    "rationale": "My original forecast of 5% was based on the short timeframe, a government-advised 'quiet period' for a by-election, and the threat of industrial action. After reviewing the analyses of my colleagues, I am strengthening my conviction in a 'No' outcome. Their arguments—particularly the ongoing SNP leadership transition and the Scottish Government's stated focus on domestic policy over constitutional issues—are compelling and reduce the already low likelihood of an announcement. A party focused on a leadership contest and internal unity is very unlikely to make a momentous external announcement. Furthermore, with the SNP's strategic horizon seemingly set on the 2026 Holyrood elections, a rushed announcement now appears strategically unsound. The combined weight of the short-term constraints I identified, the legal and political barriers raised by Forecaster 2, and the evidence of a differing strategic focus from Forecaster 3 makes the case for 'No' overwhelming. I am lowering my forecast from 5% to 3% to reflect this increased confidence. The probability is not lower than 3% because the resolution criteria only require an announcement by a Scottish authority, not a legally viable plan. Therefore, a purely symbolic or strategically surprising move, though now even less likely, cannot be entirely ruled out.",
