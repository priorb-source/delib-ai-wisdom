  "information": "The People's National Movement (PNM) is the incumbent party, having won the 2020 general election with 21 out of 41 seats. The main opposition, the United National Congress (UNC), won the remaining 19 seats. The country uses a first-past-the-post electoral system. Historically, the PNM has won the majority of general elections held since the year 2000.\n\nThe upcoming election on April 28, 2025, is an early election triggered by the resignation of former Prime Minister Keith Rowley. The PNM is now led by Prime Minister Stuart Young. Reports indicate that the opposition UNC has formed a coalition with the Congress of the People (COP). Among the issues raised during the campaign are high crime rates and concerns about electoral transparency, which prompted the presence of Commonwealth election observers. Former Attorney General John Jeremie has publicly endorsed the UNC.\n\nA poll conducted by Guardian TT between April 10-13, with research by pollster Hamid Ghany, indicated that the PNM was positioned to benefit from vote-splitting in Tobago's two key seats between the Tobago Progressive Democratic Patriots (TPP) and the Progressive Democratic Patriots (PDP), potentially allowing the PNM to win both. The same poll identified that 20% of the electorate was undecided or planning to split their vote. A separate poll by WIC News showed the UNC at 72% and the PNM at 18%.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 7-8 days. The election is scheduled for April 28, 2025, and results are expected to be known within 24 hours of polls closing.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The People's National Movement (PNM) is the incumbent party, having won the 2020 general election with a narrow majority of 21 out of 41 seats. The historical trend and incumbency favour a PNM victory.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The opposition United National Congress (UNC), strengthened by its coalition with the Congress of the People (COP), successfully mobilizes voters on issues like high crime rates and governance, flipping at least two PNM-held seats to win a plurality.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The PNM leverages its incumbency advantage. A split in the opposition vote in the two Tobago constituencies, as suggested by polling, allows the PNM to win both seats, securing its path to a plurality in the overall election.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans slightly towards the incumbent People's National Movement (PNM) retaining a plurality of seats. This is based on the significant advantage incumbency provides and the PNM's historical electoral success. The 2020 election result was very close (21-19), meaning only a small shift is needed for a change in government, making this a highly competitive race. Evidence for a PNM victory is supported by a Guardian TT poll which suggests a plausible path to victory through vote-splitting in Tobago's two key seats. However, there are substantial factors that temper this forecast and point towards a potential opposition victory. The main opposition, the United National Congress (UNC), has formed a coalition, potentially consolidating its voter base. It is also campaigning on a potent issue: the country's high crime rate, which often reflects poorly on the ruling party. Polling data is conflicting and a source of major uncertainty; while the Guardian TT poll points to a narrow PNM path, a WIC News poll shows an improbable but notable 72% for the UNC. I place less weight on the WIC poll due to its extreme numbers in what is typically a close political system. A large bloc of undecided voters (20%) means the outcome is far from certain. My forecast is not higher because the narrow margin from 2020, the UNC coalition, and salient anti-incumbent issues make an opposition win a very real possibility. My forecast is not lower because the power of incumbency and the specific, plausible mechanism for winning the Tobago seats provide the PNM with a solid, albeit narrow, advantage. I would update my forecast downward if further polling corroborates a UNC lead or if there is a major late-breaking scandal. I would update upward if the 20% undecided bloc shows strong signs of breaking for the PNM.",
