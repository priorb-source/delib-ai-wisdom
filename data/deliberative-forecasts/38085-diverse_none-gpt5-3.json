    "review": "Both forecasters rightly emphasize that the late‑April figure was at the threshold and that persistence alone yields a Yes. That’s a useful reminder, and I underweighted that in my initial take. However, they lean heavily on generic drought inertia without engaging two Florida‑specific factors: (1) the wet season often brings rapid, material USDM improvements in peninsular Florida once daily convection establishes, and (2) the population-weighted nature of the metric means relief in South Florida alone (Miami‑Dade/Broward/Palm Beach ~6M) can pull the statewide “residents in drought” below 14M even if northern/central areas remain dry. They also don’t account for how quickly USDM can adjust when repeated heavy rains or a tropical disturbance occur in June. Given we’re already one month past the April 28 article, the “status quo” anchor is weaker unless we have evidence that May stayed as dry. I find their arguments somewhat convincing on threshold proximity, but not on Florida-specific seasonality and population geography; thus I only modestly move upward.",
    "rationale": "Key points unchanged: June is typically the onset/establishment of Florida’s wet season, with frequent convection and occasional tropical moisture. Once that regime sets up, USDM drought coverage in the peninsula can shrink in a week or two, especially across South Florida, which disproportionately affects the population count. The bar (≥14M ≈ 60%+ of residents) likely requires sustained drought across multiple major metros, including SE Florida; that is less common by late June.\n\nWhat I’m updating: The threshold is already met as of late April, and persistence alone yields Yes. Given only four weeks to go and absent hard evidence of substantial improvement in May, it’s prudent to give some weight to drought stickiness and the possibility of a slow/patchy wet-season onset. That said, climatology still favors meaningful improvement by late June, and one strong wet week or an early-season disturbance could decisively push the count below 14M.\n\nNet: I keep a No lean on seasonal grounds and population geography, but move up from my prior to reflect threshold proximity and drought persistence over short horizons.\n\nSignals to watch: CPC 8–14 day and weeks 3–4 precipitation outlooks for Florida; daily convective coverage setting up in South Florida in early/mid June; any tropical disturbance. If early June turns notably wet in SE Florida, probabilities drop quickly; if wet-season onset is delayed or suppressed, probabilities rise.",
