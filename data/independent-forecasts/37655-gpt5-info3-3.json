  "information": "Former President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced on February 16, 2025, that the next presidential elections will take place on October 26, 2025. He claimed his information came from multiple sources, including the Office of the President, law enforcement agencies, the Central Election Commission, and a printing plant which, he alleged, was already calculating the number of ballots required. This followed earlier reports in March 2025 from The Economist, which, citing anonymous sources in the Ukrainian government, had suggested President Zelensky was planning to announce a surprise election for July 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Martial law remains in effect and the government reiterates that elections cannot be conducted or scheduled during martial law; no Verkhovna Rada resolution or Central Election Commission action sets a specific presidential election date before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Verkhovna Rada passes a resolution formally setting a date (e.g., October 26, 2025) or another competent Ukrainian authority officially publishes a specific presidential election date before July 1, possibly framing it as contingent on lifting martial law by that time.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and law: Ukraine remains under martial law, under which holding elections is prohibited. While the law clearly blocks conducting elections during martial law, in practice Kyiv has also avoided formally scheduling them while martial law persists. The default is therefore no announcement. World changes slowly, and the status quo has held through multiple 90‑day extensions.\n- Timing incentives: If the rumored date is October 26, 2025, the statutory deadline to set the date is roughly 90–100 days beforehand, which lands in late July. There is no procedural need to announce before July 1, which lowers the probability of an announcement by this cutoff.\n- Signals and rumors: The assistant’s report notes (1) Poroshenko’s Feb 16 claim that insiders expect an Oct 26, 2025 election; (2) a March Economist report of a possible surprise July 2025 vote. The July scenario now looks inconsistent with continued martial law and recent extensions. The October rumor is more plausible, but the legal and political pattern suggests the Rada would wait until closer to the deadline if it decides to schedule it at all.\n- Political calculus: The administration has consistently emphasized that wartime conditions, security risks, and enfranchisement of soldiers/IDPs/occupied territories make elections impractical. Announcing now would require either (a) committing to lift martial law by the election date, or (b) passing special legislation enabling wartime voting—both heavy lifts with short lead time. Still, Kyiv might pre‑announce to counter legitimacy attacks and to give the CEC runway, so a non‑zero chance remains.\n- Why not higher: Continued active hostilities; fresh 90‑day martial‑law extension into August; no public, concrete government moves to amend election law or empower wartime voting; no deadline pressure before July 1 for an October election.\n- Why not lower: Persistent political pressure from opposition and some international voices; credible‑sounding rumors about an October date; potential desire to signal democratic intent ahead of high‑profile diplomatic events in June. A pre‑July announcement is conceivable, even if the election ultimately depended on lifting martial law.\n- What would raise my forecast: Introduction or fast‑tracking of a Rada resolution to set a fall 2025 date; public statements by Zelensky, the Speaker, or the CEC indicating readiness to schedule; draft legal changes enabling wartime voting; signals that martial law might be lifted (or tailored) before the election.\n- What would lower it: Renewed large‑scale offensives or security setbacks; another categorical government statement ruling out any 2025 election; CEC/public‑sector briefings saying 2025 is infeasible; additional extensions or indications martial law will run through autumn without change.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine announce a presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Next Ukrainian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_presidential_election)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFormer President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced on February 16, 2025, that the next presidential elections will take place on October 26, 2025. He claimed his information came from multiple sources, including the Office of the President, law enforcement agencies, the Central Election Commission, and a printing plant which, he alleged, was already calculating the number of ballots required.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
