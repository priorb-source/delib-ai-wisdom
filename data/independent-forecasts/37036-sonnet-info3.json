  "information": "Historical data shows that Senate exploratory committees often last three to six months before a formal campaign launch. Many candidates for the 2026 cycle in other states, such as Andy Barr in Kentucky and Haley Stevens in Michigan, announced their candidacies in April 2025. In his previous 2024 Senate run, Osborn formally announced his candidacy in July 2023, approximately 16 months before the election. A similar timeline for the 2026 race would place his announcement in June or July of 2025. Osborn himself has publicly stated that he will \"decide by early summer.\"",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks (39 days) from April 23, 2025 to June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Dan Osborn does not announce his candidacy before June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Osborn continues his exploratory process through late April and May, taking time to assess fundraising potential, polling, and organizational support. He follows through on his stated plan to decide by 'early summer,' making his formal announcement in mid-to-late June or early July, consistent with his 2024 race timeline when he announced in July 2023.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Osborn's exploratory committee quickly determines that conditions are favorable for a race against Pete Ricketts. Seeing other 2026 Senate candidates like Andy Barr and Haley Stevens announce in April, and wanting to secure early momentum, endorsements, and fundraising, he formally announces his candidacy in mid-to-late May 2025, interpreting 'early summer' broadly to include late spring.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. As of April 3, 2025 (20 days ago), Osborn was only 'exploring' a bid, not yet committed. His public statement that he will 'decide by early summer' is crucial - while meteorological summer begins June 1, this phrasing suggests a timeframe more likely to be mid-June or later. His historical pattern reinforces this: in his 2024 Senate race, he announced in July 2023, approximately 16 months before the election. A similar timeline for 2026 would place an announcement in June or July 2025. The research assistant's note that exploratory committees often last 3-6 months is relevant - if Osborn began exploring around March/April 2025, June-July fits this pattern. However, I'm not assigning an extremely low probability because: (1) 39 days remains meaningful time for a decision; (2) other 2026 candidates announced in April, suggesting competitive pressure to enter early; (3) 'early summer' is ambiguous and could include late May; (4) Osborn already has name recognition from his 2024 race, potentially shortening his decision timeline. My forecast would increase if we saw concrete signs of campaign infrastructure being built (hiring staff, reserving ad time, major donor meetings) or if Osborn made more definitive public statements. It would decrease if he gave interviews emphasizing the need for careful deliberation or if we passed mid-May with no announcement signals.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).

Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
