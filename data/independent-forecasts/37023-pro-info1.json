  "information": "The preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April 2025 was 50.8, the second-lowest level since records began in 1952. This represented the fourth consecutive monthly decline, a drop of 11% from the March 2025 reading of 57.0, and a cumulative decline of over 30% since December 2024. According to Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu, the decline was 'pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks, as the preliminary May 2025 data is typically released mid-month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The strong downward momentum of the past four months would continue, resulting in a May sentiment reading less than or equal to the April reading of 50.8.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Persistent inflation concerns, particularly around gas and food prices, continue to weigh on consumers. Economic data released in early May, such as the CPI or jobs report, is either in line with pessimistic expectations or worse. This confirms consumers' negative outlook, causing the index to fall further or stagnate at its historical low.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A key inflation report shows an unexpected and significant cooling of price pressures, or the labor market shows surprising resilience. This positive economic surprise provides a sense of relief to households, leading to a modest 'dead cat bounce' in sentiment from its extremely low April level, pushing the index just above 50.8.",
    "rationale": "My forecast weighs the powerful negative momentum against the high probability of a rebound from a near-record low. The research indicates that the April 2025 consumer sentiment reading of 50.8 is the result of a fourth consecutive monthly decline, described as 'pervasive and unanimous.' This suggests a deeply entrenched pessimism that favors a 'No' outcome, as such strong trends are difficult to reverse in a single month. However, the index is now at an extreme low, second only to the all-time low recorded during the 1980 recession. Sentiment is volatile at such troughs, and even a minor positive catalyst could cause a rebound. The threshold for a 'Yes' is merely any value greater than 50.8, which is a very low bar. My 40% probability acknowledges that while the negative trend is more likely to continue, the potential for a small relief-driven bounce is substantial. My forecast is not lower because sentiment at extreme lows is highly susceptible to even small positive shocks. My forecast is not higher because the breadth and depth of the recent decline suggest that a significant positive economic surprise would be needed to reverse the trend, and that is not the base case. I would raise my probability following a surprisingly low inflation report or a sharp drop in energy prices. I would lower it if leading indicators for May's economy show further weakness.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April 2025 was 50.8, the second-lowest level since records began in 1952. This represented the fourth consecutive monthly decline, a drop of 11% from the March 2025 reading of 57.0, and a cumulative decline of over 30% since December 2024. According to Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu, the decline was 'pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation.'\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
