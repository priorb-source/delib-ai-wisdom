  "information": "South Korea has been experiencing significant political instability. President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in December 2024, leading to his impeachment. The country's Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment on April 4, 2025. Following these events, a snap presidential election has been scheduled for June 3, 2025. Additionally, law enforcement authorities recently conducted a search of former President Yoon's residence as part of corruption allegations.\n\nSeveral large-scale protests have occurred in South Korea in the first half of 2025. On January 4, an estimated 35,000 people protested. On February 2, reports on participant numbers in an anti-Yoon protest ranged from 38,000 to 100,000. On February 15, a rally in Seoul demanding impeachment reportedly involved 300,000 people. On March 29, a protest demanding the president's resignation was estimated at 12,000 participants. On May 1, a Labor Day rally in Seoul organized by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) had over 8,000 participants, with police estimating attendance as high as 13,000.\n\nMultiple civic and political groups have been actively organizing demonstrations. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) and the Democratic Labor Union held rallies for Labor Day on May 1. The KCTU has also announced its intention to organize a general strike in July. Groups such as 'Free Korea' and 'Candlelight Action' have consistently held rallies and counter-rallies in response to political developments. Conservative groups have also planned a rally for May 18th in Gwangju.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months. The relevant period for protest events is until July 1, 2025. The outcome will be known once the Global Protest Tracker has updated its data for this period.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The current political climate in South Korea is highly volatile, with a consistent pattern of large-scale protests occurring monthly in 2025. Maintaining this status quo would lead to at least one more protest of this size in the next two months.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The snap presidential election on June 3rd proceeds smoothly, and the result is widely accepted by the public. This leads to a significant de-escalation of political tensions, and no major civic or political group manages to mobilize over 10,000 people for a protest before July 1st.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In the lead-up to the June 3rd election, or in reaction to its result, one of the many active political or civic groups (such as KCTU, Candlelight Action, or conservative organizations) organizes a rally. Consistent with the trend from early 2025, this protest draws a crowd exceeding 10,000 participants and is consequently logged by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the extremely high level of political mobilization in South Korea throughout 2025. The impeachment of President Yoon and the upcoming snap presidential election on June 3rd have created a deeply polarized environment conducive to protests. The research data indicates a strong precedent: multiple protests have already surpassed the 10,000-participant threshold this year, including events in January (35,000), February (up to 100,000 and 300,000), March (12,000), and a May 1st rally police estimated as high as 13,000. This establishes a high base rate of qualifying events. The two-month forecast period includes the critical pre- and post-election window, which is a prime time for mass mobilization. Multiple well-organized groups on all sides of the political spectrum have demonstrated the capability to stage such events. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 90% primarily because of potential variance in the resolution source. The Global Protest Tracker may have a reporting lag or use a conservative methodology for estimating crowd sizes that could cause it to miss or undercount an event. There is also a small but non-zero chance that the election results in a period of national unity or protest fatigue that lasts through the end of June.\n\nMy probability is not lower because that would require a sharp and sudden break from the established pattern of protest activity. Given the deep political divisions and the number of active organizing bodies, a complete absence of large-scale protests for two full months seems highly improbable.\n\nI would raise my forecast if major protest groups explicitly announce plans for large rallies in May or June. I would lower my forecast if the main political rivals and civic groups issue a joint call for calm that leads to a demonstrable reduction in street mobilization.",
