    "review": "Both forecasters raise important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2's fiscal year-end argument is particularly compelling - the pattern of March production surges followed by April normalization is a well-documented phenomenon in Japanese economic data. This is a structural seasonal factor that significantly increases the risk of mean reversion after March's strong 7.6% gain. This was a blind spot in my initial analysis. Forecaster 3 makes valid counterpoints about the weak yen providing tailwinds for Tohoku's export-oriented manufacturers and frames March's increase as normalization after three weak months rather than an overshoot. The sector-specific knowledge (Toyota Motor East Japan, auto/electronics concentration) adds useful context. However, I find the fiscal year-end effect more persuasive as a systematic pattern that applies broadly across Japanese industrial production. The weak yen tailwind, while real, may not be strong enough to overcome the typical post-fiscal-year lull.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast slightly downward. The fiscal year-end effect identified by Forecaster 2 is the most significant new information - Japanese companies routinely boost production in March to meet annual targets, creating a structural headwind for April growth. This pattern makes consecutive strong months (March +7.6%, then April positive) less likely than I initially assessed. However, I'm not moving as low as 45% because: (1) Forecaster 3's point about normalization after three declining months has merit - the March increase may reflect genuine recovery rather than pure fiscal manipulation, (2) the weak yen provides real support for Tohoku's export sectors, and (3) base rates still suggest near 50-50 odds absent strong directional signals. The combination of fiscal year-end headwinds, high volatility in the series, and mean reversion risk after a large positive month outweighs the momentum and currency factors. My forecast moves from 48% to 46%, acknowledging the fiscal calendar effect while maintaining that the outcome remains highly uncertain.",
