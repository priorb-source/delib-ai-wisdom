  "information": "The People's National Movement (PNM) is the incumbent party, having won the 2020 general election with 21 out of 41 seats. The main opposition, the United National Congress (UNC), won the remaining 19 seats. The country uses a first-past-the-post electoral system. Historically, the PNM has won the majority of general elections held since the year 2000.\n\nThe upcoming election on April 28, 2025, is an early election triggered by the resignation of former Prime Minister Keith Rowley. The PNM is now led by Prime Minister Stuart Young. Reports indicate that the opposition UNC has formed a coalition with the Congress of the People (COP). Among the issues raised during the campaign are high crime rates and concerns about electoral transparency, which prompted the presence of Commonwealth election observers. Former Attorney General John Jeremie has publicly endorsed the UNC.\n\nA poll conducted by Guardian TT between April 10-13, with research by pollster Hamid Ghany, indicated that the PNM was positioned to benefit from vote-splitting in Tobago's two key seats between the Tobago Progressive Democratic Patriots (TPP) and the Progressive Democratic Patriots (PDP), potentially allowing the PNM to win both. The same poll identified that 20% of the electorate was undecided or planning to split their vote. A separate poll by WIC News showed the UNC at 72% and the PNM at 18%.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "One week. The election is on April 28, 2025, with results expected shortly thereafter.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The People's National Movement (PNM), as the incumbent party that has won the majority of recent elections, wins the most seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The United National Congress (UNC) and its coalition partner, the Congress of the People (COP), successfully capitalize on public discontent over issues like high crime rates, winning over a significant portion of the 20% undecided voters and flipping several marginal seats to gain a plurality.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The PNM leverages its incumbency advantage and retains its core support. Crucially, vote-splitting in the two Tobago constituencies between the TPP and PDP allows the PNM to win both seats, securing them a plurality even if they face minor losses in Trinidad.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on weighing the PNM's significant incumbency advantage against a strengthening opposition and public discontent. The PNM is the incumbent and has a strong historical track record, having won the 2020 election and most elections since 2000. This structural advantage forms the baseline for my forecast. The report indicates a credible mechanism for a PNM victory: a Guardian TT poll suggests vote-splitting among opposition parties in Tobago's two key seats is likely to hand them to the PNM. In a close election (the 2020 result was 22-19), winning these two seats would be a major step towards securing a plurality. However, the probability is not higher because the opposition appears more unified with the UNC-COP coalition, which could consolidate anti-PNM votes. Furthermore, high crime rates are a potent issue that historically works against incumbents. The 20% of undecided voters identified in the poll represents significant volatility; if this group breaks heavily for the opposition, the UNC could win. The WIC News poll showing a landslide UNC victory (72% to 18%) is treated with extreme skepticism as such a dramatic swing is highly improbable and it is likely an outlier or methodologically unsound compared to the more detailed Guardian TT poll. My forecast is not lower because the incumbency advantage in a first-past-the-post system is powerful, and the detailed report on vote-splitting in Tobago provides a specific, plausible pathway to a PNM victory. I would increase my forecast if further credible polls confirm a PNM lead or if the Tobago opposition fails to consolidate. I would decrease it if credible polls showed a consistent UNC lead or if the Tobago parties form a last-minute pact.",
