    "review": "My initial forecast of 65% was significantly more optimistic than my colleagues' (28% and 24%). Their analyses provided a crucial counterbalance, and I find their reasoning largely convincing on two key points I had under-weighted. First, they rightly emphasize the fundamental incompatibility of the publicly stated 'red lines.' The US demand for complete dismantlement and Iran's refusal to do so represents a massive chasm that is unlikely to be bridged with a comprehensive treaty in such a short time. Second, they correctly highlight the extreme compression of the timeline; negotiating a complex, verifiable nuclear deal in under seven weeks is historically improbable. These arguments expose my initial optimism as being too reliant on the positive but vague diplomatic language ('constructive,' 'convergence'). However, Forecaster 3 raised an excellent point that all of us should weigh more heavily: the resolution criteria are broad and could be met by an interim or framework agreement, not just a comprehensive final deal. My colleagues' low forecasts seem to be anchored on the extreme difficulty of a comprehensive deal, perhaps under-valuing the possibility of a more limited 'freeze-for-freeze' style agreement that kicks the can down the road on the toughest issues.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I have substantially decreased my forecast. They made compelling arguments that the vast gulf between the stated core positions of the US (complete dismantlement) and Iran (no dismantlement) and the extremely short timeframe make a comprehensive, final-status agreement highly unlikely before the deadline. I agree that I initially over-weighted the positive diplomatic rhetoric and under-weighted these fundamental obstacles.\n\nHowever, I am not lowering my forecast to their level because I believe they are under-appreciating the strong possibility of a less-ambitious interim agreement, which would satisfy the resolution criteria. The high tempo of negotiations (four rounds since April), the pressure of a presidential deadline, and the notable external signal from Israeli intelligence all point to a powerful political will on both sides to achieve *some* kind of announced deal. An interim agreement—for example, Iran freezes or eliminates its 60% enriched uranium stockpile in exchange for targeted sanctions relief (like the release of frozen funds)—is a politically viable path. It would allow both administrations to claim a diplomatic victory and de-escalate the immediate crisis without forcing either to immediately abandon their core 'red line' positions. The existence of this plausible off-ramp keeps the probability of a 'Yes' resolution higher than a 'No.' My revised forecast reflects a balance: a comprehensive deal is unlikely, but an interim deal is a probable outcome given the current momentum.",
