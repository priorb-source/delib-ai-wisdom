  "information": "On May 2, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly denied a Politico report that the administration was considering lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, calling the claim 'unequivocally false.' Both Rubio and U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum are reported to be opponents of the idea. Furthermore, reports from May 5, 2025, indicated that President Trump is considering a bipartisan bill that would impose 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian energy and expand existing sanctions.\n\nA Politico report from April 24, 2025, citing multiple sources, claimed the White House was discussing the possibility of lifting sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as part of negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine. The report stated that U.S. Special Envoy Steve Wietkoff was the main proponent of the initiative and had instructed his team to compile a list of all energy sanctions imposed on Russia. Other reports have mentioned proposals from American investors and the former CEO of Nord Stream 2 AG to restart the pipeline with U.S. participation.\n\nThe European Union has expressed a lack of interest in restoring the pipeline's operation, and is reportedly preparing new sanctions against Russia. Nord Stream 2 AG has also faced legal and financial setbacks in Europe. In April 2025, a German court upheld a bank's decision to terminate the company's accounts due to U.S. sanctions risks. The company is operating under a moratorium on bankruptcy in Switzerland and has been making payments to small creditors to facilitate a larger financial settlement. One of the two pipeline strings was severely damaged in an attack in September 2022.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 55 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - Nord Stream 2 AG remains on the OFAC sanctions list",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US maintains its current sanctions posture on Nord Stream 2 AG through July 1, 2025. Secretary of State Rubio's explicit denial holds, and the administration either maintains the status quo or even expands sanctions as indicated by the May 5 reports about potential 500% tariffs on Russian energy importers. No breakthrough in Ukraine negotiations occurs that would justify lifting sanctions as a concession.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration executes a rapid policy reversal, with President Trump overruling opposition from Rubio and Burgum. Special Envoy Wietkoff successfully advocates for lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2 AG as part of a broader Ukraine peace deal or Russia negotiation package. The administration removes Nord Stream 2 AG from the OFAC sanctions list before July 1, 2025, despite domestic political criticism.",
    "rationale": "The status quo heavily favors sanctions remaining in place. The most critical evidence is the explicit May 2 denial by Secretary Rubio calling reports of lifting sanctions 'unequivocally false' - just 4 days ago from today. This is reinforced by May 5 reports that Trump is considering expanded sanctions and 500% tariffs on Russian energy importers, moving in the exact opposite direction. Key cabinet officials (Rubio and Burgum) are reported opponents of lifting sanctions. With only ~55 days until resolution, achieving such a significant policy reversal would require: (1) overcoming explicit recent denials, (2) overruling cabinet-level opposition, (3) a dramatic breakthrough in Ukraine negotiations, and (4) accepting significant domestic political criticism. The April 24 Politico report about White House discussions does suggest some internal consideration occurred, and Special Envoy Wietkoff may still be advocating behind the scenes. Trump administrations have proven capable of surprising policy shifts. However, the combination of recent explicit denial, short timeframe, cabinet opposition, and reports of moving toward expanded sanctions makes a reversal highly unlikely. Additionally, even if US sanctions were lifted, the EU has no interest in restoring pipeline operations, one pipeline string is damaged, and Nord Stream 2 AG faces severe financial difficulties in Europe. My forecast is not lower (1-2%) because Trump foreign policy can be unpredictable and there may be ongoing negotiations unknown to us. It's not higher (15-20%) because the May 2 explicit denial and May 5 expansion reports are very recent, clear, and directly contradictory to lifting sanctions, and the 55-day timeframe is extremely compressed for such a reversal.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
