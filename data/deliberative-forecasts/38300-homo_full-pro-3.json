    "review": "Both other forecasters provided excellent, well-reasoned analyses that align closely with my own. We all identified the same core tension: the strong positive momentum and +1.49% YoY buffer from April, supported by positive May PMIs, versus the significant warning signs from the sharp drop in the LEI and the first decline in core PPI since 2020. The analyses are comprehensive and there is no new evidence presented that I hadn't already considered. The only difference is a slight variation in the weighting of these conflicting signals, with Forecaster 3 placing slightly more emphasis on the 'fragility' of the recent growth, leading to a forecast of 80% compared to my and Forecaster 2's 85%. This difference reflects a reasonable disagreement in judgment rather than a flaw in anyone's reasoning.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 85%. My reasoning remains unchanged. The deliberation process reinforced my view that the question's short-term nature—resolving on the single data point for May 2025—makes contemporaneous data more significant than forward-looking indicators. The positive ISM and S&P Global PMIs for May are direct signals of manufacturing activity during the month in question. While the sharp drops in the LEI and PPI are indeed concerning and suggest potential weakness ahead, their primary impact is more likely to materialize in the data for June, July, and beyond. For the May outcome, these indicators represent a risk factor, which I believe is appropriately captured by not forecasting above 85%. However, the substantial +1.49% YoY buffer from April is a hard data point that provides significant inertia. Overcoming this buffer to produce a negative YoY reading would require a very sharp month-over-month contraction, an event made unlikely by the positive PMI data. Therefore, while I acknowledge the fragility noted by Forecaster 3, my initial assessment that the momentum and contemporaneous data outweigh the forward-looking risks for this specific forecast period holds.",
