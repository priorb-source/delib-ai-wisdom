    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the strong status quo of non-communication, the mutual-acknowledgment hurdle, and the relevance of the May 10–11 Geneva talks. Forecaster 2’s framing of Geneva as the primary catalyst aligns with my view, but I think their 25% “ceiling” feels slightly conservative given the summit rumor. Forecaster 3’s point that “world changes slowly” and that leader-level rapprochement usually needs visible groundwork is a useful corrective; it pushes against my initial optimism and highlights the lack of concrete indicators (e.g., planning signals, joint statements) so far. Neither added new factual inputs, but their emphasis on the acknowledgment requirement and the absence of clear pre-summit scaffolding makes me modestly less confident than my initial 32%.",
    "rationale": "I continue to see two main pathways to a call within May 12–June 15: (1) Geneva produces enough progress or a framework that warrants a leader call to endorse next steps; or (2) credible movement toward a mid-June summit triggers a preparatory call. A third, less likely path is crisis management after escalation. Countervailing factors remain strong: China’s recent denials of leader calls, Trump’s May 5 remark of “no immediate plans,” and the mutual-acknowledgment requirement. Given peers’ points about the lack of visible groundwork and China’s incentives not to validate calls unless they carry clear benefit, I’m trimming my estimate. I will adjust up if Geneva yields a joint readout signaling leader-level engagement or if summit planning is credibly reported; I will adjust down if Geneva ends acrimoniously or if either side reiterates that no leader contact is planned in the near term.",
