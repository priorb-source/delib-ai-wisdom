    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I diverge significantly on the weight given to commissioner influence. While Forecaster 2 views Goodell's support as near-decisive ('cannot be overstated'), both Forecaster 3 and I see it as meaningful but not determinative given the 75% supermajority requirement. Forecaster 3 raises an excellent point I had underweighted: the enforcement ramifications of a broad field-wide ban on pushing/pulling any ball carrier. This isn't just about short-yardage plays - it would affect routine blocking and many common situations, potentially creating new complications that could actually lose votes rather than gain them despite the political framing benefits. The reframing may be a double-edged sword. Forecaster 3 also correctly emphasizes that owners have declined to ban this play multiple times in recent years, establishing a pattern of resistance. The lack of injury data remains a critical weakness - safety concerns are typically the most persuasive driver of rule changes, and their absence here leaves the case resting on aesthetics and competitive balance, both weaker foundations. Forecaster 2's optimism about leadership influence converting 8 votes in weeks seems insufficiently grounded in the structural obstacles.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I find myself aligned most closely with Forecaster 3's reasoning. The core mathematical challenge remains: converting 8 additional owners in about a week (from today, May 12, to the May 20-21 meeting) when the proposal just failed in April. While I should give slightly more weight to commissioner influence than I initially did - Forecaster 2 makes a fair point that when league leadership unifies behind a priority it matters - this must be balanced against several countervailing factors: (1) The broad reframing that Forecaster 2 views as advantageous may actually create enforcement problems that deter swing voters, as Forecaster 3 astutely notes; (2) The complete absence of injury data undermines the most persuasive reform argument; (3) The historical pattern of owners declining to ban this play multiple times; (4) The 75% supermajority is an exceptionally high bar. I'm updating slightly upward from 32% to 36% to account for potentially underweighting leadership influence and the genuine momentum suggested by the immediate May meeting. However, the fundamental obstacles - the vote gap, lack of safety data, enforcement complications with the broader rule, and status quo bias - prevent me from moving substantially higher.",
