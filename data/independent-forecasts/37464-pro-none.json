    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be determined on or after June 1, 2025, which is in less than one month from today's date of May 8, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The recall's status on the USDA FSIS website is currently 'Active'. If this status does not change before the deadline, the question will resolve as 'No'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) does not complete its recall verification procedures for LPK1 by the deadline. This could be due to standard processing times, administrative backlogs, or minor delays in documentation from the company, resulting in the recall status remaining 'Active' on June 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "LPK1 provides all necessary documentation to the FSIS, demonstrating that the recalled product has been removed from commerce and corrective actions are in place. The FSIS completes its review and changes the recall's status to 'Closed' on its website before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an analysis of the recall's characteristics versus the typical speed of bureaucratic processes. The status quo is that the recall is 'Active', making 'No' the default outcome if nothing changes. Factors favoring a 'Yes' resolution include the recall's limited scope (vending machines in Washington) and the short shelf-life of the product (ready-to-eat wrap). This simplicity should expedite the verification process, as all affected products have long since expired and been removed from sale. However, the primary factor favoring a 'No' resolution is the inherent inertia and procedural thoroughness of government agencies like the FSIS. Closing a recall requires a formal verification process that can take several months, and the period from February 24 to June 1 is just over three months. My research assistant's report indicated no additional information is available, so this forecast relies on general principles. My probability is not higher because three months is a relatively tight timeline for a government process to reach full closure. It is not lower because the limited and simple nature of this specific recall makes a timely closure plausible. I would increase my forecast upon learning that the median closure time for similar FSIS recalls is under 90 days. I would decrease it upon learning of a general backlog in FSIS recall closures.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
