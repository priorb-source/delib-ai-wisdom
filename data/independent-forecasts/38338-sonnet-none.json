    "status_quo_outcome": "No - John Morgan has not announced his candidacy as of June 6, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "John Morgan continues to explore and discuss a potential gubernatorial run but decides either to delay his announcement until after July 1, 2025, or ultimately decides not to run. He may be conducting polling, fundraising assessments, or waiting for other political developments before committing to a formal announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "John Morgan follows through on his campaign blueprint discussions and makes a formal announcement of his candidacy for Florida governor within the next 25 days. The May 15 Politico article indicates serious preparation and planning, and he decides the timing is right to officially enter the race before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The May 15, 2025 Politico article (approximately 3 weeks ago) indicates John Morgan is actively laying out campaign blueprints for a possible Florida governor run, which suggests serious consideration and preparation. However, three weeks have elapsed since that article without an announcement, which is a meaningful data point. The status quo remains that he has NOT announced, and good forecasting practice emphasizes that the status quo tends to persist - the world changes slowly. While 'laying out a campaign blueprint' shows intent, it's distinctly different from actually announcing candidacy. Many politicians discuss and plan potential runs without ultimately announcing. The 25-day timeframe remaining is sufficient for an announcement if he's decided to run, but not so long that it's inevitable. The lack of additional information from my research assistant suggests no major developments since the May article. My forecast is not higher because: (1) the status quo of no announcement has held for weeks, (2) exploratory discussions frequently don't result in actual candidacies, and (3) there's no evidence of imminent announcement. My forecast is not lower because: (1) the recent article shows genuine preparation and planning, (2) 25 days is a reasonable timeframe for someone in the planning phase, and (3) the fact this made Politico suggests real political momentum. I would revise upward with news of: specific announcement dates, campaign staff hires, or fundraising launches. I would revise downward with: statements of non-candidacy, reports of insurmountable obstacles, or continued silence as July 1 approaches.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill John Morgan announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [John Morgan lays out campaign blueprint for possible Florida governor run](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/15/john-morgan-florida-governor-run-00351005)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.
