    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds useful elite‑signaling evidence (ministers saying Ouattara will be the RHDP candidate, youth wing pressure). That increases the chance he ultimately runs but doesn’t by itself raise the odds of a May declaration, since the question requires a personal declaration and there’s no identified May RHDP conclave. Forecaster 3 introduces a new and important factor: opposition weakness (e.g., late‑April ruling against Tidjane Thiam, continued constraints on Gbagbo/Soro). If accurate, that reduces any urgency to announce early and supports a wait‑and‑see posture into summer. Both analyses correctly emphasize regional and 2020 timing norms and the strategic value of preserving optionality. Overall, I find their reasoning sound; the added point about opposition weakness nudges the probability down slightly from my prior, while elite signals keep a floor under it.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is just about a month, and there’s no publicized May forcing event (party congress/investiture or legal deadline). Ouattara’s January stance (“not yet decided”) and historical pattern (late 2020 declaration) favor continued ambiguity. Elite cues suggest he is the preferred RHDP option, but those do not necessitate a May declaration. If the opposition is indeed further weakened by late‑April rulings, his incentive to rush diminishes, making a pre‑June 1 announcement less likely. Upside risks to this view would be credible reports of an RHDP National Council or congress scheduled in May with an agenda to nominate him, or advance notice of a presidential address signaling a decision. In the absence of such triggers, I slightly edge my forecast down from 28% to 27%.",
