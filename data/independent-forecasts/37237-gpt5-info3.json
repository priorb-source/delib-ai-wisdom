  "information": "Data from the shipping and logistics sector in April 2025 reflected the impact of new tariffs. Freightos and Hillebrand data showed that Asia-U.S. container rates had fallen by 5%. Shipping lines reported an increase in 'blank sailings' (cancelled voyages) and vessels from China that were only half-full. In 2024, China accounted for approximately 36% of U.S. imports, with its share being higher at key ports like Los Angeles (51%) and Long Beach (61%). Port data indicated that the number of ships scheduled to arrive in May 2025 had decreased significantly. Separately, Mexico had become the U.S.'s top trading partner in early 2025, with its exports to the U.S. growing 9.6% in January to a record $41.68 billion.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5–6 weeks (Census/BEA will publish the April 2025 International Trade in Goods and Services report in early June 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Slight year-over-year increase (i.e., a Yes) in nominal total imports, as monthly imports usually drift upward with nominal GDP and services strength.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariffs depress China-sourced goods volumes in April, evidenced by blank sailings and half-full vessels; Asia–US ocean rates fall and port calls soften. Goods import values decline a few percent year-over-year, and services growth can’t fully offset, leaving total imports at or below 338,483 million USD.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trade diversion (e.g., Mexico and other partners) plus continued growth in services imports (travel, business services) lift total imports above April 2024 despite China weakness; energy import values are stable-to-up, pushing the total above 338,483 million USD.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: In normal conditions, total U.S. imports (goods + services) tend to rise y/y with nominal demand, so the status quo would slightly favor a Yes versus April 2024’s 338.483B threshold.\n\nEvidence pushing toward No: The assistant’s research indicates April 2025 saw tariff impacts: Asia–U.S. container rates down ~5%, more blank sailings, and reports of half‑full China-origin vessels. China is ~36% of U.S. goods imports, so weakness there has outsized effects on goods. Port schedules for May were reduced, consistent with softer flows around April/May. Lower freight rates and cancellations typically coincide with weaker volumes and values. If oil prices are flat-to-lower y/y and the dollar is firm, nominal import values could be further restrained.\n\nOffsetting factors: Diversion toward Mexico and others continues; Mexico exports to the U.S. were up 9.6% y/y in January and Mexico has been the top U.S. trading partner in early 2025. Services imports (travel, transport, business services) have been robust and could add several billion y/y, partially offsetting goods softness. Tariffs raise consumer prices, but import valuation in this series generally excludes duties, so higher sticker prices don’t necessarily lift reported import values much.\n\nNet take: With clear signs of April goods softness from China and shipping, I lean slightly to a No. However, diversion to Mexico/others and likely services strength prevent me from going too low. I balance these with the historical tendency for nominal imports to drift up, landing shy of even odds.\n\nWhy not higher: Multiple high-frequency indicators (blank sailings, half‑full vessels, lower spot rates) point to weaker April goods volumes, especially from China.\nWhy not lower: Trade diversion and services growth can materially offset goods weakness; U.S. domestic demand remains resilient, and energy/import price moves could add back some value.\n\nWhat would move me up: Strong April TEU data at major ports (LA/LB, NY/NJ, Savannah); the late‑May Advance International Trade in Goods showing goods imports at or above April 2024; indications of higher petroleum import values; robust services imports proxies (outbound travel, transportation services).\nWhat would move me down: Advance goods data showing a clear y/y drop (>2–3%); April port throughput materially below last year; China’s April exports to the U.S. down sharply; evidence of weaker energy import values.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US imports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of imports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 338,483 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nData from the shipping and logistics sector in April 2025 reflected the impact of new tariffs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
