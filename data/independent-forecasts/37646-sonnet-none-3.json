    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Somalia is not currently listed as 'Available' on the Starlink availability map",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the license announcement, Starlink faces delays in finalizing ground infrastructure, regulatory processes, or business arrangements in Somalia. The company decides to postpone the public availability listing until after July 1, 2025, or encounters unexpected technical or political obstacles that prevent them from meeting this timeline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following Musk's license announcement, Starlink rapidly completes the necessary infrastructure deployments and regulatory finalization in Somalia. The company updates their availability map to show Somalia as 'Available' before July 1, 2025, either as they begin service rollout or in anticipation of imminent launch.",
    "rationale": "The license announcement is a significant positive signal, as regulatory approval is typically the major hurdle for Starlink market entry. However, several factors temper optimism: (1) The timeframe is very short - only 1.5 months to go from license to public availability listing; (2) Somalia presents unique operational challenges including limited infrastructure, security concerns, and political instability; (3) There is no information about actual on-ground progress beyond the license announcement; (4) Status quo bias suggests that even with a license, deployment often takes longer than initially expected. On the positive side, the question only requires a website listing showing 'Available' status, not full operational service, which lowers the bar. Starlink has demonstrated ability to move quickly in some markets once licensed. However, the lack of any additional information about deployment progress, timeline announcements, or ground station installations is concerning. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of actual deployment activity or specific launch date announcements. For it to move lower, news of complications or continued silence would be meaningful. Balancing the positive signal of the license against the short timeline and challenging environment, I estimate a moderately low probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Somalia as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Musk announces Starlink license for Somalia](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Musk_announces_Starlink_license_for_Somalia_999.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Somalia listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
