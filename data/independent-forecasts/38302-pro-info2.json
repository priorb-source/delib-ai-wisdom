  "information": "China's manufacturing activity contracted for the second consecutive month in May, with the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) standing at 49.5, below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. The non-manufacturing PMI also showed a slight decline to 50.3 in May from 50.4 in the previous month. In the property sector, new-home sales from the 100 largest developers fell by 8.6% year-on-year in May, following an 8.7% drop in April.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. The official CPI data for May is typically released by China's National Bureau of Statistics around the 9th to the 12th of the following month. Today is June 2nd, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Given the premise of three consecutive months of deflation leading into May and the latest weak economic data for May, the status quo points to this deflationary trend continuing for a fourth month.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome, meaning a flat or positive year-on-year CPI reading, would likely be caused by a stronger-than-expected surge in consumer spending during the May Labor Day holiday, a sudden spike in global commodity or domestic food prices, or a significant base effect from a particularly low CPI reading in May 2024.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome occurs as persistent weakness in the property sector continues to depress consumer confidence and spending, while overcapacity in manufacturing leads to falling goods prices. These factors overwhelm any minor seasonal price increases, resulting in a negative year-on-year CPI reading.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong deflationary momentum indicated by the three prior months of negative CPI readings. Economic trends of this nature tend to have inertia. The high-frequency data for May provided by my research assistant reinforces this view. The manufacturing PMI of 49.5 indicates a contraction in factory activity for the second straight month, signaling weak demand and potential for factory-gate price cuts. Similarly, the 8.6% year-on-year drop in new-home sales highlights the ongoing property crisis, which severely dampens consumer wealth and confidence, thus suppressing aggregate demand. This collection of data points strongly to a continuation of deflationary pressures. My forecast is not higher than 80% to account for the inherent volatility in monthly inflation data. A small, unexpected price increase in a key component like pork or energy, or a favorable base effect, could be sufficient to push the headline figure just across the zero-percent threshold. My forecast is not lower than 80% because every major indicator for May points towards continued economic weakness. Reversing the established deflationary trend would require a substantial positive shock, for which there is currently no evidence. I would reconsider my forecast if preliminary data on May holiday spending showed a massive, unexpected surge, or if the Producer Price Index (PPI) data for May, when released, showed a surprising reversal into inflationary territory.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill China experience a 4th month in a row of deflation in its May CPI report?\n\nQuestion background:\nSCMP: [China’s consumer prices fall in April, fuelling fears of deflation](https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3309834/chinas-consumer-prices-fall-april-fuelling-fears-deflation)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the \"Percent Change from Year Ago, Not Seasonally Adjusted\" data presented at [FRED Consumer Price Indices (CPIs, HICPs), COICOP 1999: Consumer Price Index: Total for China (CHNCPIALLMINMEI)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CHNCPIALLMINMEI#) is negative for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nChina's manufacturing activity contracted for the second consecutive month in May, with the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) standing at 49.5, below the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
