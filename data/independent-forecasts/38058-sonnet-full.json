  "information": "U.S. President Donald Trump has postponed the implementation of a 50% tariff on goods from the European Union, moving the deadline from June 1 to July 9, 2025. The delay came after a request from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who stated more time was needed for negotiations. U.S. officials have expressed frustration with the EU's cautious approach and lack of specific proposals in the trade talks. A key U.S. demand for a new trade agreement is a commitment from the EU to impose tariffs on Chinese industrial goods, which has not yet been agreed to.\n\nDomestically, U.S. tariff policy has drawn media commentary. The New York Post's editorial board warned of 'tariff burnout' among President Trump's supporters due to inconsistent implementation. The Wall Street Journal's editorial board has also criticized the tariffs, suggesting they would primarily benefit lobbyists and could be used by politicians to leverage campaign contributions. Internationally, Vietnam is reportedly fast-tracking a $1.5 billion Trump golf resort, a move linked to efforts to secure a new trade agreement with the U.S. and avoid potential tariffs as a 90-day pause on trade levies approaches its end.\n\nThe discussions around U.S. tariff policy have had observable economic effects. President Trump's announcement to delay the EU tariffs led to a positive shift in market sentiment and a surge in U.S. stock futures. In early April 2025, after the signing of an executive order for a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff', there were reports of U.S. consumers stockpiling goods in anticipation of price increases. According to an estimate by the Tax Foundation, the proposed tariffs could cost U.S. households an additional $830 in 2025, reduce the nation's GDP by 0.4%, and result in the loss of 350,000 jobs.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 35 days remain in the resolution window, which extends through June 30, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - tariffs continue to appear on at least one newspaper's front page every day",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariffs remain a dominant story due to ongoing EU trade negotiations ahead of the July 9 deadline, continued economic impacts, and Trump's active tariff policy. At least one of the two papers covers tariff-related news on their front page every single day through June 30, 2025",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major breaking news event (natural disaster, international crisis, or significant domestic political development) dominates both newspapers' front pages for at least one day, pushing tariff coverage to interior pages. Alternatively, a slow news weekend coincides with a temporary lull in tariff announcements or negotiations, causing both papers to omit the word from their front pages on the same day",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors continued tariff coverage. Key factors supporting a No outcome: (1) The EU tariff deadline of July 9 is approaching, making June a critical period for trade negotiations and coverage; (2) Trump is actively implementing tariff policy with multiple countries; (3) Tariffs are having measurable economic effects ($830 per household, 0.4% GDP impact, 350,000 job losses estimated); (4) Both papers' editorial boards are actively critiquing tariff policy; (5) The research explicitly notes tariffs are 'highly likely' to appear in news coverage.\n\nHowever, the question only requires ONE day where BOTH papers omit 'tariff' from their front pages over ~35 remaining days. This creates some probability of a Yes outcome through: (1) Major breaking news that completely dominates coverage; (2) Weekend editions with lighter political/economic coverage; (3) Brief lulls in tariff-related announcements.\n\nThe challenge is that BOTH papers must miss tariffs on the SAME day, and the word can appear anywhere on the front page including business sections. Given that these papers cover different angles (NYT more politics/policy, WSJ more business/markets), achieving simultaneous omission is difficult.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: the approaching July 9 EU deadline will drive heavy June coverage, Trump's active tariff agenda ensures ongoing news flow, and economic impacts generate continuous reporting angles. My forecast is not lower because: 35 days provides meaningful opportunity for at least one coincidental omission, major unforeseen news events could temporarily dominate coverage, and weekend editions may have lighter tariff coverage.\n\nI would update higher if: major international crisis emerges, Trump announces a pause in tariff implementation, or we observe several days where one paper omits tariffs. I would update lower if: tariff coverage intensifies in late May/early June, new tariff announcements occur, or EU negotiations become more contentious",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
