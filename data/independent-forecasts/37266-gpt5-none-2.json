    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Mozambique retains a non–Level 4 advisory (with localized “Do Not Travel” areas such as parts of Cabo Delgado), and no nationwide upgrade occurs.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security conditions remain mixed but manageable: sporadic unrest/protests and ongoing insurgent activity remain largely confined to the north; the U.S. Embassy continues normal operations; State maintains the current country-level rating (likely Level 2 or 3) with area-specific Level 4 cautions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp, nationwide deterioration: widespread violent unrest or a coup; major terrorist incidents outside the far north (e.g., in Maputo or major corridors); a severe disaster causing state failure and consular drawdowns; or an ordered departure/evacuation leading State to elevate Mozambique to Level 4 countrywide before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: Mozambique’s country-level advisory has typically been below Level 4, with localized “Do Not Travel” guidance for parts of Cabo Delgado due to terrorism. The U.S. rarely assigns Level 4 to an entire country absent war, systemic state collapse, extreme kidnapping risk, or mass civil conflict. Over the next ~60 days, absent a major shock, the most likely outcome is no change to a nationwide Level 4.\n- Recent signals: The linked item notes a non-U.S. travel industry advisory amid protests. Such advisories can reflect short-term unrest but do not, by themselves, imply a U.S. State Department jump to Level 4. The U.S. tends to respond to sustained, nationwide threats to Americans or serious degradation of government/consular capability.\n- Seasonality/disaster risk: Peak cyclone risk in Mozambique is typically earlier (Nov–Apr). While off-season events are possible, the probability of a catastrophic, nationwide-impact disaster in May–June is lower than in peak season.\n- Base rates: New Level 4 countrywide designations are infrequent and usually tied to major conflicts (e.g., Sudan, Gaza/Israel at times), collapses (Haiti, Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen), or severe arbitrary detention risks (e.g., North Korea, Russia at times). Mozambique’s insurgency is geographically concentrated and, while serious, has not recently driven a nationwide Level 4.\nWhy not higher: To reach Level 4 so soon, we’d likely need an abrupt, severe, nationwide crisis (e.g., mass-casualty attacks in the south/Maputo, a coup, or a large-scale embassy drawdown). There’s no strong evidence of that trajectory right now.\nWhy not lower: There is some tail risk: insurgent resurgence beyond Cabo Delgado, major unrest tied to political tensions, or an unforeseen disaster could trigger a rapid advisory change.\nWhat would move me up: (1) U.S. Embassy Maputo orders departure or reduces staff; (2) multiple significant attacks or widespread violence in major southern cities; (3) declaration of nationwide state of emergency with sustained lethal unrest; (4) credible forecasts of a severe cyclone or disaster with likely systemic impacts.\nWhat would move me down: (1) Continued stability in Maputo and the south; (2) State updating Mozambique’s page maintaining Level 2/3 with localized restrictions; (3) evidence of improving security in Cabo Delgado and no embassy posture changes.\nAssistant’s report: No additional information provided; thus I rely on baseline patterns, recent public context of protests, and typical State Department behavior.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mozambique receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMSN: [ATTA issues travel advisory for Mozambique amid protests](https://www.msn.com/en-za/travel/travel-preparation/atta-issues-travel-advisory-for-mozambique-amid-protests/ar-AA1wHavB?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Mozambique has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Mozambique.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
