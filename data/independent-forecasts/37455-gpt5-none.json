    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of now Lesotho is not shown as Available on Starlink’s map, and if nothing changes it will remain No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the April 14 license, Starlink delays launch while it finalizes type approval/importation, payment and logistics, geofencing near South Africa, and/or gateway/backhaul arrangements. The availability map remains Coming Soon/Not Available through June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink completes remaining regulatory and operational steps and flips Lesotho to Available in late May or June, enabling orders and showing at least some Lesotho tiles as Available on the map.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and status quo: The site does not yet show Lesotho as Available. Good forecasting practice gives extra weight to the status quo, especially with only ~8 weeks left.\n- Positive factors: (1) A license was reportedly granted on April 14, 2025, which is typically the main gating item before Starlink marks a country Available. (2) Starlink’s 2025 rollout machine is mature; recent countries have sometimes gone live within weeks of licensing. (3) Lesotho’s small size and the ubiquity of inter-satellite links reduce the need for in-country gateways.\n- Negative factors: (1) There is already a ~3-week lag since licensing without availability, implying remaining operational steps (type approval/import, payments, distribution) are not yet done. (2) Lesotho is landlocked within South Africa, where Starlink has faced regulatory constraints; careful geofencing, fulfillment, and political optics could slow activation. (3) In many countries the license-to-availability lag has ranged from several weeks to a few months; with only ~54 days left, a slip would push activation past the deadline.\n- Net assessment: Licensing is a strong leading indicator, but not sufficient for a high probability within this short window. I weight the status quo and typical lag times heavily, but allow substantial probability for a June go-live given Starlink’s pace once paperwork is complete.\n- Why not higher: If immediate launch were imminent, we might have seen availability by now or local partner announcements; region-specific sensitivities with South Africa add friction. Typical lags can exceed two months.\n- Why not lower: The key regulatory hurdle appears cleared; Starlink often moves quickly after that and can operate via ISL without local gateways. A late-May or June flip is plausible.\n- What would move me up: Evidence of type approval/shipping readiness (order page accepting Lesotho addresses), local distribution/partner announcements, map hints (e.g., tiles briefly showing Available), or official Starlink social posts naming Lesotho launch timing.\n- What would move me down: Reports of additional regulatory steps needed (e.g., spectrum/type approval delays), customs/import snags, payment processing obstacles, or political pushback linking Lesotho service to South Africa’s situation.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information was available beyond the licensing headline, so the forecast relies on general rollout patterns and constraints.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Lesotho as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lesotho grants license to Musk's Starlink](https://www.ewn.co.za/2025/04/14/lesotho-grants-license-to-musks-starlink)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Lesotho listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
