  "information": "UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer faces criticism from Brexit supporters over concessions in a 'renewal' agreement with the EU. His government is also grappling with a sluggish economy, contributing to a decline in popularity. Starmer faces a growing political challenge from Nigel Farage's Reform UK party, whose economic plans he has described as reckless and comparable to the policies of former Prime Minister Liz Truss. Starmer's government plans to reduce the civil service by 50,000 jobs by 2030, aiming to save £2 billion annually, with details to be announced in a spending review on June 11.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's cabinet approval rating fell to a record low of 26% in a March 2025 Asahi newspaper poll. The 14-percentage-point drop followed a controversy involving the distribution of 100,000 yen gift vouchers to 15 lawmakers from the ruling party, which sparked public distrust. Although Ishiba apologized, he stated he used his own 'pocket money' as a sign of appreciation. All 15 lawmakers subsequently returned the vouchers. On the economic front, Ishiba is pursuing a growth-oriented economy driven by wage increases and investment, and has called for cooperation with the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren).\n\nPolling data from early 2025 shows fluctuating approval ratings for both leaders. A Morning Consult screenshot from early May reported Starmer at 36% and Ishiba at 29%, while other reports citing late-May figures placed Starmer at 28% and Ishiba at 32%. Earlier, a March 2025 Ipsos UK poll found that 30% of Britons believed Starmer was performing well, an increase of 7 percentage points. A YouGov poll from the same period showed Starmer with a 31% positive rating, his highest since September 2024. In April 2025, Starmer and Ishiba held a telephone call to discuss the economic impact of U.S. tariffs and agreed to cooperate on global issues.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025; Morning Consult reports a 7-day trailing average updated weekly)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Starmer has generally polled a few points above Ishiba on Morning Consult in recent months (e.g., early May snapshot reportedly 36% vs 29%), though late‑May signals are mixed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Morning Consult’s late‑June 7‑day average shows Ishiba at or above Starmer (including a tie). Example path: Starmer slips into the high‑20s after backlash to the June 11 spending review/civil service cuts and EU ‘renewal’ deal criticism, while Ishiba rebounds into the low‑30s as the voucher controversy fades and economic sentiment improves.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starmer holds in the low/mid‑30s while Ishiba remains high‑20s/low‑30s amid lingering scandal fatigue and cost‑of‑living headwinds in Japan; by the July 1 check, Morning Consult shows Starmer a few points higher.",
    "rationale": "- Framing and baseline: Morning Consult is the resolution source and uses a 7‑day trailing average, which reduces volatility over a 1‑month horizon. Historically since late 2024, UK PM Keir Starmer has typically registered approvals around the low/mid‑30s on MC, while Japan’s PM Shigeru Ishiba has tended to be in the high‑20s to low‑30s. The assistant’s report cites an early‑May MC snapshot (Starmer 36%, Ishiba 29%), consistent with that pattern.\n- Conflicting late‑May signals: The report also notes other late‑May figures putting Starmer at 28% and Ishiba at 32%. If those are indeed Morning Consult numbers, the near‑term status quo would tilt No. However, given (a) MC’s smoothing, (b) prior months’ typical spread favoring Starmer, and (c) Japan’s broader polling context (Asahi had Ishiba’s cabinet approval at 26% in March), I place more weight on the medium‑run MC pattern than on a single late‑May mention that may not be strictly comparable or may reflect short‑lived movement.\n- Fundamentals and likely drift: \n  • UK: Starmer faces headwinds (EU ‘renewal’ concessions, Reform UK pressure, civil service cuts/spending review on June 11). These could shave a couple of points but are unlikely to cause a large sustained swing in a month given MC’s 7‑day averaging.\n  • Japan: Ishiba’s numbers have been suppressed by scandals (e.g., gift vouchers) and cost‑of‑living issues. Some rebound is plausible if the scandal recedes and wage growth headlines persist, but sustained climbs into the mid‑30s seem less likely over a short window absent a clear positive shock.\n- Status quo weighting: Because the world changes slowly and MC’s methodology smooths moves, I overweight the established MC spread (Starmer modestly higher) and the historical tendency of Japanese PMs to have relatively low approvals versus UK PMs in normal times.\n- Why not higher? The late‑May reports suggesting Ishiba > Starmer, plus potential UK backlash to June policy announcements, make a flip or near‑tie plausible. Also, ties resolve No, and the leaders’ bands overlap, so a 1–2 point edge either way is quite possible.\n- Why not lower? The broader MC track record in early 2025 and Japan’s recent scandal drag argue that Starmer being modestly higher remains the more likely single outcome. The short time horizon and smoothing reduce the chance of a large, durable crossover.\n- Key updates that would move me:\n  • Downward (toward No): Credible MC updates in mid/late June showing Starmer ≤30% and Ishiba ≥32% for at least a week; significant UK backlash to the spending review; a new UK scandal.\n  • Upward (toward Yes): MC updates showing Ishiba back in the high‑20s while Starmer holds ≥33%; renewed negative headlines in Japan (funding/scandal) or economic stress (yen slide, inflation) depressing Ishiba’s approval.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.
