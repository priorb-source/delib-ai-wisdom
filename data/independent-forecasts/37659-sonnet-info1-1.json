  "information": "According to multiple independent news sources from April 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker showed significant progress. A Blick.ch report from April 8 stated that 100 out of 302 objectives were completed. A week later, on April 16, a Medium.com article reported the number had risen to 105 completed objectives, with an additional 44 listed as \"in progress\". An earlier report from The Daily Dot on February 25 noted that over 36% of its monitored objectives were implemented. One analysis contained in the reports calculated the historical completion rate at approximately 2.2 objectives per day.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "46 days from today (May 16, 2025) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the tracker will exceed 120 objectives marked as Done",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A substantial slowdown in objective completion occurs, potentially due to intensified political opposition, legal challenges blocking implementation, administrative capacity constraints, or changes in how the tracker classifies objectives as 'Done'. The completion rate would need to drop below 0.2 objectives per day.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The implementation pace continues at any reasonable fraction of its recent rate. With 105 objectives already completed as of April 16 and 44 more in progress, the tracker maintains momentum and reaches or exceeds 120 by July 1.",
    "rationale": "The mathematical case for Yes is strong. As of April 16, 105 objectives were done with 44 in progress. To reach 120 by July 1 requires only 15 more completions over 76 days, or 0.197 objectives per day. Recent data shows a completion rate of 0.625 per day (5 objectives from April 8-16), and historical rates were reportedly 2.2 per day. Even if the pace slowed to one-quarter of the recent rate (0.156/day), we'd reach 117 objectives - just short of the threshold. At half the recent rate, we'd reach 143 objectives. The substantial buffer of 44 'in progress' objectives provides additional confidence. The main downside risk is that early objectives may have been easier to complete, and later ones could face more resistance or complexity. There could also be legal challenges, political pushback, or administrative capacity constraints that haven't yet materialized. Changes in tracker methodology could also affect counts. However, the required completion rate is so low relative to observed trends that it would take a major systematic slowdown to prevent reaching 120. I'm not assigning higher probability (95+%) because we're extrapolating from limited recent data, and political/legal dynamics could shift. I'm not going lower because the mathematical margin is comfortable and the status quo strongly favors Yes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it is less than 120, this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple independent news sources from April 2025, the Project 2025 Tracker showed significant progress.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
