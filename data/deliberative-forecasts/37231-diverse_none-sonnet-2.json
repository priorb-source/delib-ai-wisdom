    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a critically important piece of information that I lacked: they claim March 2025 was 2.5% according to Trading Economics. If accurate, this fundamentally changes the analysis. A baseline of 2.5% just one month prior creates strong inertia - unemployment rates rarely jump 0.5+ percentage points in a single month absent major shocks. Forecaster 2's 88% appears justified given this data point and the lack of evidence for April-specific disruptions severe enough to cause such a rapid increase. Forecaster 3's analysis at 60% appropriately acknowledges structural factors (nearshoring, informality) that support low unemployment, though their forecast seems somewhat conservative if we accept the March 2.5% figure. The key discrepancy is that my research assistant provided no data, yet Forecaster 2 cites specific March figures from the resolving source. This is either crucial new information or a misunderstanding. Both forecasters correctly note that tariff impacts typically materialize gradually, not instantly, which reduces April-specific risk.",
    "rationale": "The decisive factor is whether March 2025 was indeed 2.5% as Forecaster 2 claims. If true, this establishes overwhelming evidence for a Yes outcome, as: (1) month-to-month persistence is strong in unemployment data; (2) a 0.5+ point increase in one month would be historically unusual; (3) tariff effects take time to flow through to employment statistics. I'm updating significantly upward from my initial 47% because Forecaster 2's specific citation of March data from the resolving source appears credible and would be oddly specific to fabricate. However, I'm not going as high as 88% because: (1) I cannot independently verify the March figure; (2) some monthly volatility exists; (3) the tariff situation represents real economic headwinds; (4) a reading of exactly 3.0% would resolve as No. My updated forecast of 75% reflects high confidence based on the reported March baseline while maintaining reasonable uncertainty about data accuracy and monthly variation.",
