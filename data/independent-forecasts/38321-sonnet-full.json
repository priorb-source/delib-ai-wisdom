  "information": "According to multiple news reports from early June 2025, the White House has officially confirmed that US President Donald Trump will attend the NATO summit in The Hague. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated, 'I can confirm that Trump will attend the NATO summit.' This confirmation was also echoed by officials from allied nations. Dutch Prime Minister Dik Scoh announced Trump's intention to attend following a phone call between the two leaders. Similarly, Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski stated that Trump had reaffirmed his commitment to the alliance and would be present at the summit.\n\nA primary focus of the summit will be defense spending among NATO members. President Trump has been advocating for member countries to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, a significant increase from the current 2% target. In response to this pressure, NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte (or Jens Stoltenberg, sources vary) has reportedly proposed a compromise deal: a target of 3.5% of GDP on direct defense spending by 2032, with an additional 1.5% allocated for broader security-related expenditures. The discussions will also address military aid to Ukraine, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is expected to attend.\n\nThe NATO summit is scheduled to take place from June 24 to June 26, 2025, at the World Forum in The Hague, Netherlands. This will be the first time the Netherlands has hosted a NATO summit. Over 6,000 delegates and 2,000 journalists from 32 NATO member countries and partner nations are expected to be in attendance. President Trump's schedule for June 2025 also includes other high-profile international travel, such as his attendance at the G7 leaders' summit in Kananaskis, Canada, from June 15 to 17.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20-22 days until the NATO summit begins on June 24, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Trump attends the summit as officially confirmed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump cancels attendance due to an unexpected domestic crisis, health issue, last-minute diplomatic incident, or simply changes his schedule despite official confirmations",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump follows through on the White House's official confirmation and attends the NATO summit in The Hague from June 24-26 as planned, participating in discussions on defense spending and Ukraine",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly supports Trump attending this summit. The White House Press Secretary has officially confirmed attendance, and this has been corroborated by Dutch and Polish officials following direct conversations with Trump. The summit addresses core Trump priorities - particularly his push for NATO members to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP. The timing is also favorable: with only 20 days until the summit, official travel plans are typically locked in at this stage. Additionally, Trump has already scheduled other international travel (G7 in Canada June 15-17), indicating he's committed to this period of diplomatic engagement. The status quo outcome is clearly YES, and good forecasting practice suggests putting substantial weight on the status quo since dramatic changes are less common than continuation of current trajectories. However, I'm not forecasting above 90% for several reasons: Trump is known for unpredictability and has changed plans on short notice in the past; three weeks provides enough time for unexpected circumstances (health issues, domestic crises, diplomatic incidents); and absolute certainty is rarely warranted in political forecasting. For my forecast to move higher, I would need to see Trump actually depart for Europe or arrive in the Netherlands, or get much closer to the event date without any issues emerging. For it to move lower, I would need to see White House statements walking back the commitment, reports of health or scheduling issues, or major crises that would require his presence in the US.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
