    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until June 30, 2025 inclusive)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "PLA continues gray-zone pressure—air and naval incursions, missile firings, cyber and economic coercion, or even a temporary blockade/exercise—without landing PLA ground forces on Taiwan-held territory. The US condemns coercion but does not accuse China of a ground invasion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "PLA marines or special forces land on Taiwan-controlled territory (e.g., Kinmen, Matsu, Pratas/Dongsha, Taiping/Itu Aba, or the main island). The White House/State/Defense publicly states that China has invaded Taiwan by sending ground forces onto Taiwan-held territory, explicitly characterizing it as an invasion.",
    "rationale": "Time is short (~8 weeks) and an amphibious landing is a very high bar: it would be militarily complex, strategically risky, and almost certainly visible in advance. The baseline is continued coercion without a ground landing. China has preferred incremental, deniable pressure (air, maritime militia, coast guard) rather than overt PLA ground-force landings that would likely trigger severe international response. Even a limited seizure scenario (e.g., a small offshore islet) is more plausible than a main-island assault, but Beijing could try to use coast guard or paramilitary personnel to muddy the waters; the US might then avoid the specific “invasion with ground forces” phrasing required by this resolution. The US would almost certainly accuse China of an invasion if PLA ground troops landed, but that hinges on the landing actually occurring. No fresh indicators (mobilization, amphibious staging, evacuation warnings, allied force posture surges) suggest imminent landings. Hence, the status quo (No) gets heavy weight. Not higher: because there’s no clear warning signs and Beijing’s incentives favor coercion over immediate landings. Not lower: because tail risks remain—a rapid crisis, miscalculation, or a limited islet seizure with PLA Marines could prompt an explicit US accusation. Upward updates: credible reports of PLA amphibious/air assault mobilization, unusual RO-RO and amphib shipping activity near Fujian, civilian ferry requisitions, cyber prelude plus embargo moves, evacuation advisories, or US Indo-Pacific posture spikes. Downward updates: sustained de-escalatory signaling, cancellation of large PLA drills, confidence-building measures, or renewed cross-strait economic openings. The research assistant provided no additional info, so this relies on general strategic priors and the short time horizon.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCFR: [Why China-Taiwan Relations Are So Tense](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-taiwan-relations-tension-us-policy-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan by sending its ground military forces into Taiwan without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
