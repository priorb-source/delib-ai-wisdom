  "information": "The IMF has conditioned an agreement on the implementation of several key reforms. While Lebanon has completed some prior actions, including passing amendments to the bank-secrecy law and establishing an electricity-tariff framework, significant obstacles remain. The passage of a bank-restructuring law and measures to control the cash economy are described as unresolved and politically contentious issues. The IMF has publicly characterized the progress in talks as 'slow' and has expressed specific concerns about provisions in the proposed banking reform law, including the composition of a 'Higher Banking Authority' and the scope of its powers.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Negotiations continue to stall due to political gridlock in Lebanon over key reforms, and no agreement is reached.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Lebanese political factions fail to reach a consensus on the contentious bank-restructuring law and other IMF-mandated reforms. The IMF maintains its position that these prior actions are non-negotiable, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an agreement being announced.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing an imminent and catastrophic economic collapse or under intense international pressure, Lebanon's political leaders forge a last-minute compromise. They rapidly pass legislation on banking reform and capital controls that meets the IMF's minimum requirements, allowing for the formal announcement of a deal just before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the status quo, which involves protracted negotiations with little progress on fundamental, politically contentious reforms. The research assistant's report confirms this, highlighting that a bank-restructuring law and measures to control the cash economy remain 'unresolved'. The IMF's own characterization of progress as 'slow' and its specific concerns about proposed legislation indicate that the two sides are not close to a final agreement. With only one month remaining until the deadline, the time is insufficient to overcome years of political paralysis and legislate the complex and painful reforms required by the IMF. The track record of the Lebanese political elite in implementing such reforms is exceptionally poor, as it directly challenges their vested interests.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because a framework for a deal, the 2022 Staff-Level Agreement, does exist. There is always a non-zero chance that a severe escalation of the economic or security crisis could force a rapid political consensus, or that external geopolitical actors could pressure both sides into a last-minute agreement to prevent a total state collapse.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 5% because the obstacles are structural, not superficial. The required reforms represent a fundamental shift in Lebanon's economic governance, which the ruling class has consistently resisted. The short timeline makes overcoming this deep-seated resistance highly improbable. To update my forecast higher, I would need to see concrete evidence of a political breakthrough, such as the Lebanese parliament scheduling an emergency session to pass an IMF-compliant bank restructuring law. Conversely, a public statement from either party emphasizing the deep divisions would cause me to lower the forecast.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the IMF and Lebanon announce an agreement before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lebanon finance minister confident of a new deal with IMF to help crumbling economy](https://www.newarab.com/news/lebanon-finance-minister-confident-new-deal-imf)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Lebanon and the International Monetary Fund announce any economic agreement between the two entities signed after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025. In order to count, it must involve the IMF agreeing to provide money to Lebanon, whether through loans, grants, or any other means.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe IMF has conditioned an agreement on the implementation of several key reforms.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
