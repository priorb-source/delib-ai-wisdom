    "review": "- Forecaster 2’s key premise—that Kalshi already offers daily baseball markets—would dominate the forecast if true, but they provide no evidence. Given the CFTC’s historical stance (e.g., denial of ErisX NFL contracts as gaming), I’m skeptical that Kalshi has live, real-money MLB game markets without a clear regulatory shift. Their 70% seems to rely on an unverified status quo. They correctly note the “every day” operational stringency, but underweight the regulatory gating risk.\n- Forecaster 3 highlights the all-days requirement and operational risks well, but the claim that MLB might have league-wide off-days in June is likely incorrect; June almost always has at least one MLB game each day (league-wide off-days cluster around the All-Star break in July). So that specific risk is overstated. Their 35% still seems high absent confirmation that Kalshi lists MLB games.\n- Net: I find F2’s confidence unwarranted without evidence that sports markets are already live. F3’s operational concerns are valid, but their schedule worry is likely wrong. The binding constraint remains regulatory permissibility; the referenced court news is about elections and does not obviously unlock sports markets on Kalshi within days.",
    "rationale": "My prior view was that CFTC precedent makes near-term, real-money MLB game markets on a DCM unlikely, and the “all-days-in-June” bar compounds failure modes. The new inputs introduce one upside scenario: if Kalshi already has daily MLB markets, continuation through June could be likely. However, I have no confirmation of that, and CFTC history points the other way. I downweight Forecaster 3’s MLB off-day concern but keep the operational “every day” requirement as a minor risk if markets exist.\nBayes-y breakdown: \n- P(markets already live on Kalshi) ≈ 15–25% (allowing for the chance my info is outdated). \n- If live, P(continuous daily offering across June) ≈ 80–90% (some operational/regulatory tail risk). \n- If not live, P(launch and perfect continuity in June) ≈ 1–3%.\nThis yields a blended probability around low-to-mid teens. I’m nudging up from my initial 5% to reflect the possibility that sports markets are already operating, but I remain well below 50% due to the regulatory gate and the strict “every day” requirement.",
