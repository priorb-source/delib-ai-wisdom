  "information": "Colombia has declared a national health and economic emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, reports indicate 79 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since September 2024, with a case fatality rate cited as approximately 45-50%. The government has ordered a mass vaccination campaign and requires travelers to high-risk areas, and those arriving from certain countries like Brazil and Ecuador, to present a yellow fever vaccination card. The Ministry of Health has identified over 400 municipalities as being at 'high' or 'very high' risk.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 2 \"Practice Enhanced Precautions\" travel notice for yellow fever in South America in April 2025, which includes Colombia. This notice advises travelers to get vaccinated. Historically, the CDC has not elevated yellow fever outbreaks beyond Level 2, even during larger epidemics such as those in Brazil (2017–18, with over 2,000 cases) and Nigeria (2019). Level 3 notices are typically reserved for situations with sustained urban transmission, overwhelmed healthcare capacity, or for diseases where risk cannot be mitigated by standard measures like vaccination.\n\nThe current yellow fever outbreak in Colombia is primarily concentrated in rural departments with low tourist traffic, such as Tolima and Putumayo. As of late April 2025, there have been no verified cases of urban transmission in major cities like Bogotá, Medellín, or Cartagena. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has reported a total of 131 cases and 53 deaths across the Americas in the first three months of 2025, with cases primarily found in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. While neighboring countries have issued alerts, they have not implemented entry bans.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "39 days (from April 23 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Colombia remains at Level 2 travel notice status",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The yellow fever outbreak remains geographically contained in rural departments, no sustained urban transmission emerges in major cities, vaccination campaigns prove effective, and the CDC maintains its historical practice of keeping yellow fever outbreaks at Level 2 regardless of size.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The outbreak spreads rapidly to major urban centers like Bogotá, Medellín, or Cartagena with sustained Aedes aegypti-mediated transmission, case numbers explode into the hundreds or thousands, healthcare systems become overwhelmed, and the CDC breaks with its historical precedent to issue a Level 3 or 4 notice.",
    "rationale": "The strongest factor weighing against a Yes outcome is the CDC's consistent historical precedent of never raising yellow fever outbreaks above Level 2, even during significantly larger epidemics. The Brazil outbreak in 2017-18 had over 2,000 cases - more than 25 times Colombia's current 79 confirmed cases - yet remained at Level 2. Similarly, Nigeria's 2019 outbreak stayed at Level 2. Level 3 notices are typically reserved for situations with sustained urban transmission, overwhelmed healthcare capacity, or diseases where standard mitigation measures are insufficient. Currently, Colombia's outbreak is concentrated in rural departments (Tolima, Putumayo) with low tourist traffic, there are no verified cases of urban transmission in major cities, and an effective vaccine exists and is being deployed through mass campaigns. For a Yes outcome to occur in just 39 days, we would need: (1) urban transmission to begin in major cities, (2) a dramatic explosion in cases, (3) the CDC to break decades of precedent, and (4) all of this to happen and be confirmed quickly enough for policy change before June 1. The short timeframe makes rapid escalation particularly unlikely given yellow fever's incubation period and the time needed for case confirmation and policy changes. My forecast is not lower because there is an active outbreak with a high case fatality rate (45-50%), a national emergency has been declared, and disease outbreaks can be unpredictable. My forecast is not higher because of the overwhelming historical precedent, the relatively small current outbreak size, absence of urban transmission, effective mitigation available, and compressed timeframe. I would update upward if cases appeared in major cities, case numbers increased dramatically, or healthcare collapse was reported. I would update downward if the outbreak showed signs of containment or case numbers stabilized.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Travel Health Notice status of Colombia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/colombia), which is \"Level 2 Practice Enhanced Precautions\" at the time of this question, is a level of greater than 2 when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nColombia has declared a national health and economic emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
