    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 40 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No reversal; the May 13, 2025 decree remains in force and parties remain dissolved with no general permission to form new ones.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The junta maintains the dissolution to consolidate control, faces limited external pressure after exiting ECOWAS, and domestic institutions (courts, legislature) do not challenge the decree. Any cosmetic political moves stop short of re-authorizing parties broadly.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing unexpected costs—such as aid freezes tied to political pluralism, large coordinated domestic protests/strikes in Bamako, or a tactical need to announce a transition roadmap—the government publicly rescinds the decree and re-opens legal space for parties to re-register and new parties to form.",
    "rationale": "- Short time horizon: With roughly 6 weeks left, major policy reversals—especially on core regime-security issues—are uncommon.\n- Regime trajectory: The May 13, 2025 dissolution follows earlier suspensions of party activity, indicating escalation rather than moderation. Reversing quickly would undercut the junta’s consolidation strategy.\n- Limited external leverage: Mali’s withdrawal from ECOWAS and realignment away from Western partners dampen immediate sanction threats. Courts and other domestic checks are unlikely to compel a reversal.\n- Base rates: Fresh authoritarian decrees restricting parties are rarely reversed within weeks absent acute shocks (mass unrest, elite splits, urgent financial conditionality).\n- Nonzero chance: Juntas sometimes make tactical concessions. A credible transition timetable requiring party participation, sharp donor conditionality with near-term disbursements at stake, or broad, sustained protests could prompt a swift announcement restoring parties. \n\nWhy not higher: There is no clear, imminent trigger forcing a U-turn, and the policy aligns with the junta’s consolidation needs. Why not lower: Authoritarian regimes can pivot unexpectedly to relieve pressure, and even limited international financial or security considerations could nudge a quick formal reversal.\n\nWhat would move me up: Announced talks with international financial institutions linking disbursements to political liberalization; public hints from the junta about an electoral timeline that presupposes party participation; large, sustained protests or elite defections. What would move me down: Further repressive steps (arrests of opposition figures, media crackdowns), rhetoric rejecting pluralism, or new legal entrenchment of the ban.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Mali reverse its decision to dissolve all political parties?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mali's Military Government Shuts Down All Political Parties](https://www.legit.ng/world/africa/1654992-malis-military-government-shuts-political-parties/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the government of Mali announces a reversal of its May 13, 2025 presidential decree dissolving all political parties in the country.\n\nA partial reversal, such as allowing the reinstatement of a limited number of parties, will only count as long as new parties are generally allowed to be formed again.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
