  "information": "The People's National Movement (PNM) is the incumbent party, having won the 2020 general election with 21 out of 41 seats. The main opposition, the United National Congress (UNC), won the remaining 19 seats. The country uses a first-past-the-post electoral system. Historically, the PNM has won the majority of general elections held since the year 2000.\n\nThe upcoming election on April 28, 2025, is an early election triggered by the resignation of former Prime Minister Keith Rowley. The PNM is now led by Prime Minister Stuart Young. Reports indicate that the opposition UNC has formed a coalition with the Congress of the People (COP). Among the issues raised during the campaign are high crime rates and concerns about electoral transparency, which prompted the presence of Commonwealth election observers. Former Attorney General John Jeremie has publicly endorsed the UNC.\n\nA poll conducted by Guardian TT between April 10-13, with research by pollster Hamid Ghany, indicated that the PNM was positioned to benefit from vote-splitting in Tobago's two key seats between the Tobago Progressive Democratic Patriots (TPP) and the Progressive Democratic Patriots (PDP), potentially allowing the PNM to win both. The same poll identified that 20% of the electorate was undecided or planning to split their vote. A separate poll by WIC News showed the UNC at 72% and the PNM at 18%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "7 days until the April 28, 2025 election",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The PNM maintains its position as the party with the most seats, as they currently hold 21 of 41 seats from the 2020 election and are the incumbent party led by PM Stuart Young",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The UNC coalition successfully capitalizes on anti-incumbent sentiment around crime and transparency concerns, consolidates opposition votes through their alliance with the Congress of the People, and wins a plurality of seats by flipping 2-3 key constituencies from the narrow 21-19 result in 2020",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The PNM holds its traditional base, benefits from vote-splitting between TPP and PDP in Tobago's two seats as suggested by the Guardian TT poll, and captures enough undecided voters (who constitute 20% of the electorate) to maintain or expand their narrow plurality from 2020",
    "rationale": "This is a highly competitive race with only 7 days until the election. The status quo is PNM holding 21 of 41 seats from 2020, just 2 seats ahead of UNC's 19. Several factors support PNM: (1) incumbency advantage, (2) historical dominance since 2000, (3) the credible Guardian TT poll suggests they're positioned to benefit from vote-splitting in Tobago's two crucial seats, and (4) large undecided bloc that could break for the incumbent. However, factors favoring UNC include: (1) successful coalition formation with COP showing opposition consolidation, (2) salient issues like high crime and electoral transparency concerns that typically hurt incumbents, (3) the transition from Rowley to Young creating potential instability, and (4) endorsements from figures like former AG John Jeremie. The WIC News poll showing 72-18 for UNC appears methodologically suspect given its extreme skew and inconsistency with other indicators - such a landslide would be unprecedented and contradicts the Guardian poll. With the 2020 election being so close and genuine competitive dynamics, this could easily swing either way. I'm not higher because the UNC coalition and anti-incumbent sentiment are real factors, and I'm not lower because incumbency, Tobago dynamics, and historical patterns favor PNM. A major scandal, late-breaking news, or significant turnout differential could shift this, but with one week left, the fundamentals are largely set.",
