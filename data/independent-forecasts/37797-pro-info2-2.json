  "information": "In February 2025, South Africa's National Treasury reported that the country had addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 FATF action items, with the remaining two expected to be resolved by June 2025. The goal is to facilitate an exit from the grey list by October 2025. In West Africa, a May 2025 meeting of the GIABA Ministerial Committee noted that Senegal had exited the FATF grey list in October 2024. However, four other regional members—Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Côte d'Ivoire—remain on the grey list, with Nigeria's government stating an aim to be removed by the end of May 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be known following the conclusion of the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The FATF 'black list' (High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action) remains unchanged, consisting of North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FATF Plenary concludes its meeting in June 2025. After reviewing the progress of blacklisted and greylisted jurisdictions, it announces that the list of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action remains unchanged, as no country qualifies for addition or removal.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The FATF announces that a country, likely one currently on the 'grey list' that has failed to meet its action plan deadlines and is deemed uncooperative, will be added to the 'black list'. A less likely Yes scenario would involve the removal of Iran or Myanmar following an unexpected and dramatic improvement in their AML/CFT regimes.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high inertia and stringent criteria associated with the FATF black list. The list is reserved for jurisdictions with severe strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regimes, and changes are infrequent.\n\nFirst, the status quo is heavily favored. The three currently blacklisted jurisdictions—North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar—are all subject to significant geopolitical challenges and international isolation. There is no current indication that any of them are close to making the fundamental, systemic, and verifiable reforms necessary for removal. Therefore, a removal from the list is extremely unlikely.\n\nThe primary possibility for a 'Yes' outcome is the addition of a new jurisdiction. This would typically be a country from the 'grey list' (Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring) that has failed to make progress and shown a clear lack of political will to implement its action plan. While the research report notes several countries on the grey list, it also highlights their active engagement to be removed (e.g., South Africa, Nigeria). This engagement makes a punitive escalation to the black list less probable, as the FATF process is designed to encourage reform, not just punish. Blacklisting is a measure of last resort.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 15% because the FATF has used this tool relatively recently (Myanmar was added in October 2022), demonstrating it is not obsolete. There is always a non-trivial risk that a grey-listed country's engagement falters, or that a sudden geopolitical event prompts the FATF to take drastic action. The FATF had previously warned Nigeria that failure to complete its action plan could lead to 'next steps', creating a plausible, albeit low-probability, path to addition.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 15% because moving a country to the black list is a major diplomatic and economic step with significant consequences. The FATF and its member states generally prefer to keep countries engaged within the grey list framework. The high bar for blacklisting, combined with the slow-moving nature of such international bodies, makes no change the most likely outcome for any given plenary meeting.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of a major breakdown in cooperation between the FATF and a key grey-listed country. I would decrease it if the FATF released pre-plenary statements suggesting continued constructive engagement with all high-risk jurisdictions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"black list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Financial Action Task Force blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force_blacklist)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action\" list, which at the time of this question consists of North Korea, Myanmar and Iran. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn February 2025, South Africa's National Treasury reported that the country had addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 FATF action items, with the remaining two expected to be resolved by June 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
