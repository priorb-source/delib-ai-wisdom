    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Claude 4 has not been released to the general public as of today",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic continues development and testing of Claude 4 but does not make it publicly available by July 1, 2025. This could be due to ongoing safety evaluations, technical refinements, or strategic timing decisions. The model might be in private beta or simply not yet announced.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic announces and releases Claude 4 to the general public in the next 6 weeks, making it accessible via their website interface or API without requiring waitlist signup. This would require a surprise announcement followed by immediate or near-immediate public availability.",
    "rationale": "With only 6 weeks remaining until the resolution date and no information indicating an imminent Claude 4 release, the status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Major AI model releases from companies like Anthropic typically involve: (1) advance announcements and marketing, (2) technical papers or blog posts describing capabilities, (3) beta testing phases, and (4) media coverage building up to launch. The research assistant found no additional information, which is significant - if Claude 4 were launching within 6 weeks, we would expect to see substantial signals. Anthropic has historically been methodical with releases, prioritizing safety and quality over speed. While surprise launches are theoretically possible in the AI industry, they are rare for flagship models. The probability is not lower (near 0%) because: companies occasionally do surprise announcements, there could be information we're not seeing, and 6 weeks is enough time for a rapid release if one were planned. The probability is not higher because: the absence of any signals this close to the deadline is very telling, major model releases require coordination and preparation that leaves traces, and the base rate for surprise releases of this magnitude is low. I would update higher if: Anthropic announces Claude 4, credible leaks emerge, or beta testing is reported. I would update lower if: Anthropic officials discuss future timelines that don't include imminent releases, or more time passes without news.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
