  "information": "The time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming 'Available' on its map varies in other African nations. For the Democratic Republic of Congo, the process took approximately 10 weeks in 2025. For Malawi and Zambia, it was about 16 weeks, and for Benin, it was 24 weeks. Niger's service was officially launched on March 13, 2025, the same day Chad's license was announced. In May 2025, a pan-African partnership between SpaceX and Airtel was announced to potentially accelerate kit distribution.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks (from May 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Starlink's availability map does not currently show service as 'Available' in Chad.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite securing a license in March 2025, minor logistical or bureaucratic delays in deploying ground infrastructure or distributing hardware push the operational launch just past the July 1, 2025 deadline, similar to the 16-24 week timelines seen in other regional rollouts.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "With the major regulatory hurdle cleared, SpaceX leverages its new pan-African partnership with Airtel to accelerate the final stages of deployment, making the service 'Available' on its map in June 2025, mirroring the faster 10-week rollout seen in the DRC.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on an analysis of precedent timelines in other African nations against the time available for Chad. According to the research, the license for Chad was secured on March 13, 2025. The deadline for this question is July 1, 2025, giving a total window of approximately 15.5 weeks from license to deadline. As of today, May 15, 2025, about 9 weeks have already passed. The provided precedents for license-to-availability timelines are the DRC (~10 weeks), Malawi and Zambia (~16 weeks), and Benin (~24 weeks). The total available time for Chad (15.5 weeks) is longer than the DRC's timeline but falls just short of the Malawi/Zambia timeline. This makes the outcome highly sensitive to small delays. The status quo is 'No', and rollouts of this nature often face unforeseen friction. However, a key new factor is the May 2025 partnership between SpaceX and Airtel, which is explicitly designed to accelerate kit distribution in Africa. This recent development makes the historical precedents a potentially conservative benchmark and suggests an accelerated timeline is plausible for Chad.  My forecast is not higher because the 15.5-week window is still very close to the 16-week timeline seen in two other countries. Any minor setback could easily tip the outcome to 'No'. The Airtel partnership is also new, and its immediate operational impact is not yet proven. My forecast is not lower because the primary hurdle—licensing—is complete. Furthermore, the rapid 10-week DRC precedent shows that fast rollouts are possible, and the Airtel partnership provides a strong reason to believe Chad's timeline could be on the faster end of the spectrum. I would increase my forecast upon official announcements of ground station completion or a specific launch date. I would decrease it upon reports of logistical issues or if other countries with similar timelines experience delays.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Chad as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[SpaceX’s Starlink Secures License to Operate in Chad](https://spaceinafrica.com/2024/11/12/spacexs-starlink-secures-license-to-operate-in-chad/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Chad listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming 'Available' on its map varies in other African nations. For the Democratic Republic of Congo, the process took approximately 10 weeks in 2025. For Malawi and Zambia, it was about 16 weeks, and for Benin, it was 24 weeks. Niger's service was officially launched on March 13, 2025, the same day Chad's license was announced. In May 2025, a pan-African partnership between SpaceX and Airtel was announced to potentially accelerate kit distribution.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
