    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters. We all identify the core dynamic as a conflict between the new administration's strong political will to enact SNAP reforms and the powerful force of bureaucratic inertia over an extremely short six-week timeframe. We unanimously agree that a formal legislative or regulatory change is impossible by the resolution date. Therefore, the only plausible path to a 'No' outcome is a rapid, top-down, symbolic edit to the USDA webpage's text. The only difference is in the precise calibration of this risk, with forecasts of 85% and 90%. I found the other forecasters' arguments to be well-reasoned and complementary to my own.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast. I found their reasoning convincing and it caused me to re-evaluate the probability I assigned to a purely symbolic website change. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the long implementation timeline for Nebraska's approved waiver—which does not take effect until January 2026—is a powerful piece of evidence that I had perhaps underweighted. If an officially approved policy change takes over a year to implement, the probability of an ad-hoc, symbolic change being pushed through the necessary internal reviews in under six weeks seems lower than my initial 15% estimate. Furthermore, Forecaster 2 made a salient point that the USDA leadership is likely preoccupied with more substantive issues, such as processing other state waivers and planning a major departmental reorganization, making a minor website edit a lower priority. The combined weight of these arguments persuades me that the risk of a 'No' outcome is closer to 10%. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast to align with the higher end of our group's consensus.",
