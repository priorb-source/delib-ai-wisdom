    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus on the fundamental difficulty of the scenario. All three forecasters agree that political inertia, the high bar set by the resolution criteria (a 4-point lead in a poll-of-polls), and the relative stability of a new government make a 'Yes' outcome highly improbable. The primary point of divergence is the magnitude of that improbability, with two of us at 8% and one at 15%. This difference stems from the weight given to the UK's recent political volatility. Forecaster 2 places more emphasis on the 'political vacuum' on the right creating an opportunity for a rapid realignment, arguing that this warrants a higher probability. Forecasters 1 and 3, conversely, believe that while volatility exists, the inertia of a new government is a much stronger prior, and that this vacuum primarily affects the opposition landscape rather than the government's standing.",
    "rationale": "I am not updating my forecast. The arguments raised by the other forecasters were well-articulated but did not introduce new information that alters my initial assessment. Forecaster 3's analysis closely mirrored my own, reinforcing my confidence in an 8% probability. We both concluded that a 'Yes' outcome would require a 'perfect storm' or 'black swan' event, which is possible but very unlikely. I find Forecaster 2's 15% forecast to be too high. While their point about the political vacuum on the right is valid for explaining Reform's rise against the Conservatives, it doesn't sufficiently address the monumental task of overtaking a new Labour government by a significant margin in just two months. The stability of a new governing party's polling, even in a volatile era, is a very strong force. My initial 8% forecast was intended to account for the small but non-zero chance of a major, system-shocking event, and I believe it remains the most accurate calibration of this low-probability outcome.",
