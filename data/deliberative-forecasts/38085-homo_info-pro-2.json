    "review": "The other forecasters provided critical perspectives that challenged my initial assessment. Forecaster 2's analysis, landing at 68%, presented a similar thesis to mine but with a more cautious probability, suggesting I had underestimated the uncertainty. Forecaster 3's analysis (45%) was particularly influential; their core argument, that one should not bet against a powerful and reliable climatological pattern like the onset of the Florida wet season, was a sound forecasting principle I had not weighted heavily enough. They also introduced new, albeit conflicting, evidence: a NOAA forecast for an active hurricane season (favoring 'No') and a separate forecast for drought persistence in South Florida (favoring 'Yes'). The key discrepancy between them on the starting number (14.5M vs 14.0M) highlights a critical uncertainty. Their combined reasoning convinced me that my initial forecast was overconfident and failed to adequately account for the high potential for rapid change during this specific one-month window.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly revising my forecast downwards from 85% to 70%. The deliberation process made it clear I was overconfident in the principle of drought inertia and under-weighting the power of Florida's seasonal climate shift. My initial forecast was anchored on the severe status quo, but my colleagues rightly argued that the period between late May and late June is precisely when Florida's climate undergoes a dramatic transition to its wet season.\n\nMy revised forecast still favors a 'Yes' outcome for two main reasons. First, the starting point is at or slightly above the 14.0 million threshold, meaning conditions must actively improve for a 'No' resolution. Second, reversing a severe drought, described as the worst in the Everglades in 13 years, requires sustained, substantial rainfall, not just a typical start to the rainy season. The NOAA forecast for drought persistence in South Florida further supports this view.\n\nHowever, I have lowered my probability by 15 points to reflect the high degree of uncertainty introduced by the impending wet season. As Forecaster 3 noted, this is a powerful climatological force. Widespread, daily thunderstorms can quickly eliminate the less severe D0-D1 drought categories where many people live, potentially pushing the total below 14.0 million in just a few weeks. The forecast for an active hurricane season also slightly increases the tail risk of a major rain-producing system that could decisively resolve the question as 'No'. My new forecast of 70% balances the strong pro-'Yes' anchor of the current situation against the very real, pro-'No' potential of a powerful seasonal shift.",
