    "review": "Both analyses are aligned with my initial view on timing and resolution mechanics. Forecaster 3 adds a useful point: blog-only IPO announcements (without a public S-1) are uncommon due to quiet-period norms, which lowers the probability that the secondary resolution path triggers. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the July 4th holiday and typical avoidance of early-July listings also nudges odds down for a late-June push. I agree with both that credible reporting of 2025 plans and named underwriters keeps a June public S-1 plausible, but the remaining window is short and seasonality works against it. I find 35% slightly high given the rarity of blog announcements and summer timing, while 20% seems a bit low given real signals of intent and the possibility of a June S-1 to preserve optionality for a late-summer/early-fall launch.",
    "rationale": "Key drivers: (1) Only ~5.5 weeks remain; (2) the question requires a public S-1 or a specific news/blog announcement by July 1; (3) issuers commonly avoid the early-July lull, pushing public filings into late August for a fall IPO; (4) many tech issuers use confidential submissions that wouldn’t count here; (5) blog announcements without a public S-1 are relatively rare. Countervailing factor: credible reporting that Discord aims for a 2025 IPO with top-tier banks suggests an active process, leaving a real—but not central—chance of a mid-to-late June public S-1. Netting these, I lower slightly from my prior to reflect the lower likelihood of the blog path and the July 4 timing pressure, while keeping probability above 20% due to the plausible June filing scenario.",
