    "review": "Forecaster 2’s main contribution is the emphasis that May 1 already cleared the 10,000+ bar, so the question pivots on whether Carnegie will log it in time. That’s a useful reframing, but I think they overstate the likelihood because GPT is selective and often centers sustained waves over routine/annual events like May Day. They also gloss over the start-date nuance and editorial choices about whether May 1 is a distinct entry versus part of a March-started wave.\nForecaster 3’s analysis is more balanced: they acknowledge strong mobilization capacity and catalysts (e.g., late-May hearings) but keep uncertainty around GPT’s update cadence and selectivity. I agree with their caution on database lag/selectivity and with the risk that ongoing actions are treated as a continuation of the March wave.\nNet: Their points nudge me upward by highlighting a clear qualifying event (May 1, ~65k) within the window and several plausible catalysts, but I remain skeptical that GPT will (a) add a new Türkiye entry with a post-launch start date and (b) explicitly note ≥10k for that entry before July 1.",
    "rationale": "I started at 35% due to two concerns: (1) GPT’s practice of anchoring protest “waves” to a single start date (likely March 2025 for the İmamoğlu protests), which would not satisfy the post-launch start-date requirement if the question launched after mid-March; and (2) the tracker’s selectivity and lag, especially for annual May Day events that aren’t framed as a new movement.\nPeers reinforced that a qualifying mass event (May 1) has already occurred, and there are plausible near-term catalysts (e.g., late-May hearings) that could trigger additional large turnouts. Those are meaningful upside factors. However, I remain cautious on the pivotal dependency: GPT must (1) choose to create a separate Türkiye entry with a start date after the question launch (May 1 or later), and (2) specify size ≥10k. Given GPT’s tendency to emphasize sustained or distinct waves and to sometimes fold dates under an earlier start, it’s far from guaranteed that May Day or subsequent events will be logged as a new entry in time.\nGiven the clear existence of ≥10k participation on May 1 and a ~8-week runway for updates, I’m nudging up but still below even odds because success hinges on GPT editorial choices rather than the occurrence of large protests per se.",
