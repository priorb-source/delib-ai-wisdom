    "review": "All three forecasters ground their analysis in the historical base rate of qualifying reports on the NUFORC database, agreeing that such events are rare (approximately 1-2 per year for all of South America). The primary point of divergence is how to adjust from this simple base rate. My initial forecast was 12%, close to the raw calculation. Forecaster 3 argued for a slightly higher 15%, citing heightened global awareness of UAPs. However, Forecaster 2 made a more compelling and specific argument for a lower forecast of 8%, pointing out that NUFORC is a US-centric, English-language platform. This creates a significant structural and linguistic barrier to reporting for pilots in South America, a factor I had not sufficiently weighted. This argument is more persuasive than the general 'awareness' factor because it speaks directly to the friction involved in using the specific reporting mechanism required for resolution.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 12% to 10%. My initial forecast was derived directly from the historical base rate of approximately 1-2 pilot reports from South America per year on NUFORC, translating to a rough monthly probability of 12.5%. The deliberation with other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 2, introduced a critical consideration I had undervalued: the structural friction of the reporting mechanism. NUFORC's nature as a US-based, English-language website likely suppresses the number of reports submitted from predominantly Spanish and Portuguese-speaking countries. This provides a strong, logical reason to believe the future probability is lower than a simple historical average would suggest. While Forecaster 3's point about heightened awareness is valid, it feels less impactful than the tangible barrier to reporting. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast by 2 percentage points to 10%, reflecting a greater appreciation for the reporting friction while still acknowledging that these rare events do occur.",
