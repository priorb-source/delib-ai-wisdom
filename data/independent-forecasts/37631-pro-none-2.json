    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of mid-May 2025, Tesla's market capitalization is slightly higher than Walmart's, but the gap has been narrowing due to recent performance trends.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tesla's market cap remains higher than Walmart's. This could be triggered by a positive catalyst for Tesla, such as a surprisingly strong Q2 2025 delivery and earnings report, a significant technological or regulatory breakthrough with its Full Self-Driving software, or a broader market rally that disproportionately benefits growth stocks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Walmart's market cap becomes higher than Tesla's. This scenario likely involves the continuation of recent trends: Tesla's stock declines further due to pressures from EV competition and concerns about slowing growth, while Walmart's stock remains stable or grows steadily due to its strong position as a defensive retail leader.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is based on the convergence of two key trends observed in early 2025. First, Tesla is facing significant headwinds, including intensifying competition, margin compression from price wars, and investor concerns over slowing growth, as reflected in the pessimistic analyst outlook mentioned in the background information. This has put sustained downward pressure on its stock valuation. Second, Walmart, as a defensive consumer staples giant, has demonstrated relative stability and steady growth, making it less susceptible to the volatility affecting high-growth tech stocks. While Tesla's market cap is currently slightly higher, the momentum strongly favors Walmart. The short timeframe of ~1.5 months suggests this trend is more likely to continue than to reverse dramatically. My probability is not higher than 65% because Tesla's stock is notoriously volatile and highly sensitive to news. A single significant positive announcement regarding its AI/robotaxi ambitions or better-than-expected delivery numbers could easily cause a sharp rally, invalidating the forecast. My probability is not lower because the fundamental challenges facing Tesla are significant and unlikely to be resolved within this short period, while Walmart's business provides a stable foundation. I would increase my forecast for 'Yes' if Tesla announces further production cuts or delays. I would decrease it if there is a credible announcement of a functioning robotaxi fleet or if its Q2 delivery numbers significantly beat expectations.",
