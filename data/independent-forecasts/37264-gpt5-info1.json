  "information": "The U.S. State Department uses a four-level travel advisory system: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). Advisories are issued based on risks such as crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and health concerns. Level 3 and Level 4 advisories are reviewed at least every six months. As of early May 2025, there were 21 countries with a Level 4 advisory, including Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No change; Niger remains at Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) through June 30, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security conditions remain roughly as they are: persistent but mostly peripheral militant violence, relative calm in Niamey, and continued (even if limited) embassy operations/consular services. State does not see a trigger to revise the advisory before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp deterioration prompts an unscheduled update: e.g., a major terror attack or kidnapping involving Westerners in Niamey or key corridors; significant nationwide unrest; the U.S. orders drawdown/temporary closure of Embassy Niamey or suspends routine consular services; or border/airspace closures severely restrict ability to assist U.S. citizens.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: According to the assistant’s research, Niger is not currently Level 4; neighbors like Mali and Burkina Faso are. State reviews Level 3/4 advisories at least every six months but can update ad hoc after shocks. With less than two months left, inertia favors the current Level 3 barring a major event. Security context: Niger continues to face jihadist threats (Tillabéri, Tahoua, Diffa) and political uncertainty under the junta, but Niamey has generally remained more stable than parts of Mali/Burkina, which helps explain why Niger has been kept at Level 3. While U.S. military withdrawal reduces broader U.S. presence, what matters most for Level 4 is the risk profile for travelers and the ability of the U.S. government to provide emergency services. Unless the embassy significantly curtails operations or there is a high-casualty incident targeting foreigners, a rapid shift to Level 4 is less likely. Why not higher: Upgrades to Level 4 are uncommon absent clear triggers (embassy suspension/ordered departure, major terror incidents, acute civil conflict). State has already tolerated elevated risk at Level 3 for months. There’s no scheduled six‑month review forcing an imminent change. Why not lower: The environment is fragile. Niger borders multiple Level 4 countries, and militant activity remains active. Any significant attack in the capital, targeted kidnapping of Westerners, or a reduction in consular capacity could push State to Level 4 quickly. What would move me up: • Ordered/authorized departure of U.S. embassy staff; suspension of routine consular services • A major terror attack or kidnapping involving Westerners, especially in Niamey • Nationwide unrest, curfews/airspace closures restricting movement/assistance. What would move me down: • Clear signs of improving security and stable embassy operations through mid‑June; lack of serious incidents affecting foreigners; public State messaging reaffirming current level.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Niger receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Niger Faces Growing Travel Risks: U.S. Travel Advisory Highlights Terrorism, Crime, and Limited Medical Care for Tourists in the Country](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/niger-faces-growing-travel-risks-u-s-travel-advisory-highlights-terrorism-crime-and-limited-medical-care-for-tourists-in-the-country/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Niger has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Niger.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. State Department uses a four-level travel advisory system: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
