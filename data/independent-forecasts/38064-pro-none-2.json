    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "16 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Publicly traded companies schedule their annual meetings in advance and have strong legal and operational incentives to hold them on the announced date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A surge in retail investor interest, potentially fueled by social media activity, overwhelms the virtual meeting platform's servers, causing a crash that forces the meeting to be postponed, similar to what occurred in 2024.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Having learned from the embarrassing technical failure in 2024, Gamestop contracts a robust virtual event provider and provisions more than enough server capacity. The meeting on June 12, 2025, proceeds and concludes without any technical disruptions.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored in the strong base rate that scheduled annual meetings of public companies occur as planned. The default probability for such an event is very high. However, this forecast must be adjusted downwards due to the significant precedent of Gamestop's 2024 meeting, which was postponed because servers crashed from overwhelming interest. This specific event demonstrates a tangible risk of failure. My probability is not higher than 85% because the 2024 incident proves the company can underestimate shareholder interest and that the 'meme stock' nature of Gamestop makes attendance uniquely unpredictable and prone to sudden surges. A repeat failure, while less likely, is not a remote possibility. My probability is not lower because the 2024 failure was a highly public and embarrassing event. It is extremely probable that management has taken significant, corrective measures over the past year to prevent a recurrence. The cost of ensuring adequate server capacity is negligible for the company, and the reputational cost of a second failure would be severe. I would increase my forecast if Gamestop announced a partnership with a top-tier virtual event provider known for handling high-capacity events. I would decrease my forecast if there is a significant spike in social media hype and trading volume related to Gamestop in the days immediately preceding June 12.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Gamestop annual meeting take place on June 12, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNBC (2024): [Servers for GameStop annual shareholder meeting crash due to overwhelming interest](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/gamestop-annual-shareholder-meeting-2024-servers-crash.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Gamestop's 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is held on June 12, 2025.\n\nThe meeting is considered to have been held when it fully completed. For example, if the meeting begins but is then postponed due to server issues, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
