  "information": "The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation was unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to 'facilitate' his return. Subsequently, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the administration to explain its diplomatic efforts with El Salvador regarding his return and set deadlines for the government to provide information and documents. An earlier court-ordered deadline for Garcia's return of April 7, 2025, passed without compliance.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — he has not yet returned, a court-ordered April 7 deadline was missed, and the government is providing explanations rather than executing the return.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Continued delay and procedural back-and-forth: DHS/DOJ file status reports describing efforts and obstacles (e.g., need for Salvadoran travel documents, scheduling, carrier issues), the judge presses but stops short of an enforceable, teeth-bearing order that immediately compels return, or El Salvador’s cooperation lags. July 1 arrives without travel finalized or entry occurring.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Escalation to effective enforcement: the district court issues stronger directives (and possibly contempt/sanctions), DHS grants parole and books travel, Salvadoran authorities issue/validate documents, and he flies to a U.S. port-of-entry where CBP paroles him in — with media or court filings confirming his arrival prior to July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Summary of key facts from the research assistant: The Supreme Court unanimously held his deportation unlawful and ordered the government to “facilitate” his return. A district judge (Paula Xinis) is actively supervising compliance, demanding documentation of diplomatic efforts with El Salvador. A firm April 7, 2025 return deadline passed without compliance, and new deadlines for government disclosures have been set.\n- Weight on the status quo: The missed April 7 deadline signals persistent obstacles (bureaucratic, diplomatic, or political). When the status quo is delay, it often continues; courts can press, but “facilitate” is weaker than “guarantee,” and coordination with a foreign government can be slow.\n- Why not higher: (1) Recent noncompliance suggests limited political will or real logistical frictions; (2) the remedy hinges on intergovernmental cooperation and agency action (parole, travel docs, carrier boarding), any of which can slip; (3) only ~2 months remain, which is tight given prior slippage.\n- Why not lower: (1) A unanimous Supreme Court ruling increases scrutiny and pressure to effectuate a return; (2) a hands-on district judge is imposing oversight and can escalate (sanctions/contempt), which often prompts action; (3) operationally, once green-lit, arranging a return can be done quickly (days to a couple weeks) if documents and parole are in place.\n- What would move me up: Court filings indicating travel documents issued, parole authorized, itinerary booked, or the judge imposing meaningful sanctions/contempt and DHS signaling imminent travel; credible reporting that El Salvador is cooperating. \n- What would move me down: Continued missed court deadlines without sanctions, filings asserting inability to secure Salvadoran cooperation, any stay/appeal limiting the district court’s remedial authority, or public statements from El Salvador refusing to facilitate departure before July.\nOverall, the Supreme Court win and active judicial oversight create a path to a quick return, but the missed deadline and demonstrated inertia make a timely return before July 1 less likely than not.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kilmar Abrego Garcia return to the United States before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Kilmar_Abrego_Garcia)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kilmar Abrego Garcia after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of the United States according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nSubsequently leaving the United States, such as a deportation, will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation was unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to 'facilitate' his return. Subsequently, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the administration to explain its diplomatic efforts with El Salvador regarding his return and set deadlines for the government to provide information and documents.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
