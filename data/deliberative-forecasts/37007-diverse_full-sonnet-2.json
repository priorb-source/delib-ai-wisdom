    "review": "The other forecasters and I have reached remarkably similar conclusions (55%, 55%, 58%), which increases my confidence that we're identifying the key dynamics correctly. Forecaster 3 makes a particularly compelling point I may have underweighted: in FPTP systems, incumbents with efficiently distributed votes can maintain seat advantages even with tight or slightly unfavorable national vote shares. This is a structural advantage beyond simple incumbency effects. Both forecasters also emphasize the Tobago vote-splitting mechanism as a 'clear, structural path' for PNM, which provides a concrete rather than speculative advantage. However, I appreciate that all of us acknowledge the real competitive dynamics - the UNC coalition, crime concerns, and leadership transition - that make this genuinely uncertain. The convergence around 55-58% suggests we're calibrating appropriately to a race that slightly favors PNM but could absolutely go either way.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating slightly upward from 55% to 57%. The key insight that moves me up is Forecaster 3's emphasis on FPTP mechanics and vote efficiency. The PNM's current 21-19 seat advantage reflects not just vote share but geographic distribution optimized over years of constituency management. Even modest swings against them nationally might not translate to seat losses if their vote is efficiently distributed. Combined with the concrete Tobago vote-splitting advantage identified by credible local polling, and with only 7 days remaining (limiting volatility), the structural case for PNM maintaining plurality is slightly stronger than I initially weighted. However, I'm not going as high as 58% because the UNC-COP coalition represents genuine opposition consolidation, crime/transparency issues create real anti-incumbent pressure, the leadership transition from Rowley to Young introduces uncertainty, and the 20% undecided bloc could break toward change in the final days. The race remains highly competitive with the UNC having a clear path to victory, but PNM's structural advantages give them a modest edge.",
