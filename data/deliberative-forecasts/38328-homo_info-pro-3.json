    "review": "Both forecasters provided compelling arguments that I had not fully weighed. Forecaster 3's introduction of a quantitative base rate was particularly convincing; their analysis suggesting a baseline probability of over 60% from normal turnover alone provides a strong floor for this forecast. This is a factor my initial analysis completely overlooked. Forecaster 2 added a critical piece of information—the actual arrest of an MEP—which elevates the Huawei scandal from a background pressure to an acute, immediate catalyst for resignation. The `Qatargate` precedent they both cite is a valid counterpoint that tempers the certainty of a scandal-driven resignation, but the combination of a high base rate and a specific, severe catalyst makes a 'Yes' outcome appear much more likely than I initially assessed.",
    "rationale": "I am increasing my forecast significantly based on the arguments from the other forecasters, which exposed two major gaps in my initial analysis. My original forecast of 65% was based primarily on the likelihood of an MEP being appointed to a national cabinet, particularly in Portugal. While this remains a valid potential cause, Forecaster 3's analysis of the historical base rate of resignations suggests that my initial forecast was roughly the probability of a 'normal' resignation occurring anyway, without any specific catalysts. This argument alone justifies a higher probability. Furthermore, Forecaster 2's clarification that the scandal involves the arrest of a sitting MEP, not just an investigation, dramatically increases the specific pressure for a resignation. The confluence of three distinct and strong potential drivers—(1) the high statistical base rate of resignations, (2) the specific likelihood of post-election cabinet appointments, and (3) the acute pressure from a scandal involving an arrest—makes the probability of at least one resignation within the short 21-day window very high. I am therefore updating my forecast from 65% to 80%.",
