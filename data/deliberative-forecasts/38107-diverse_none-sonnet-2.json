    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling analyses with important details I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2 cites specific legal precedent (*Watts v. United States*) on the 'true threat' standard, and Forecaster 3 references the more recent *Counterman v. Colorado* case requiring recklessness. Most significantly, Forecaster 3 mentions the Durham probe - a Special Counsel investigation that ended without charges against Comey. This is crucial historical context that reinforces how high the legal bar is and how resistant the system has been to prosecuting Comey even under intensive scrutiny. Forecaster 3 also notes that the resolution requires 'credible sources,' adding a verification layer that slightly reduces false positive risk. Both forecasters provide more detailed legal analysis than I did, and both independently arrived at 1%. Their reasoning is methodologically sound and well-grounded in precedent.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast downward from 2% to 1%. The key factors driving this change are: (1) The Durham probe precedent - a recent, intensive Special Counsel investigation that examined Comey's conduct extensively yet resulted in no charges. This is strong evidence that even under political pressure and thorough investigation, the legal system has been highly resistant to prosecuting him. (2) The specific legal precedent on threat prosecution (*Counterman v. Colorado*) sets a high bar requiring at least recklessness, which makes the ambiguous seashells post even less likely to support an arrest. (3) Both expert forecasters independently arrived at 1% using similar but more detailed legal reasoning. At probabilities this low, the difference between 1% and 2% is meaningful (100% relative difference). While I maintain that the broad resolution criterion ('any arrest, anywhere, any reason') and the 32-day timeframe justify staying above effectively zero, the weight of legal precedent, the Durham investigation outcome, and the compressed timeline all point toward 1% being the more defensible estimate. I remain open to updating upward if credible reports of charges, grand jury activity, or warrants emerge, but absent such developments, 1% appropriately captures the extremely low but non-zero probability.",
