    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize two solid points I only implicitly noted: (1) category-specific paths where commercial heft matters (especially Music Event and Single of the Year), and (2) multi-nomination conversion rates at major awards, which raise the at-least-one-win probability even if per-category win odds are modest. Forecaster 2’s spotlight on Music Event being friendly to marquee collaborations is a particularly relevant angle for a Wallen–Malone hit. I’m a bit less persuaded by the “status quo = no win because he’s new” framing; the four nominations themselves shift the base rate meaningfully. Neither analysis dives into category-by-category competition, so correlation risk and potential preference for core-country acts remain. Overall, their arguments nudge me slightly upward.",
    "rationale": "Post Malone’s four nominations indicate broad acceptance by ACM voters. “I Had Some Help” was a dominant, cross-format hit, and categories like Music Event (and possibly Single) often reward commercially defining tracks and high-profile collaborations. That gives a clear path to at least one win. Countervailing risks remain: outcomes across his categories are correlated, there may be a tilt toward established country mainstays in some races, and we lack concrete precursor or insider signals this close to the ceremony. Weighing the added, category-specific argument about Music Event dynamics and multi-nomination conversion rates, I’m nudging my forecast up modestly. I’m moving from 62% to 66%, reflecting a slightly stronger view that one of his four “shots on goal” converts, without assuming a broad sweep or ignoring correlated downside.",
