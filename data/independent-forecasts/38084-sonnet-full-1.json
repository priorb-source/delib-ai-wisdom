  "information": "According to the resolution source, drought.gov, approximately 22.7 million California residents were living in areas of drought (classified as D1-D4) as of the week of May 27, 2025. The U.S. Drought Monitor map, which provides this data, is updated weekly. Earlier in the year, on March 25, 2025, the California Department of Water Resources reported that water storage at Lake Oroville was 86% full and the statewide snowpack was at 96% of the normal level for that date. Consequently, the State Water Project increased its water allocation forecast to 40% of requested supplies.\n\nIn late May 2025, the National Weather Service issued extreme heat watches and advisories for several inland regions of California, with temperatures forecasted to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center also forecasted higher-than-usual temperatures across much of the state for the summer of 2025. NOAA's outlook indicated that the ongoing drought would likely persist through the end of August, with an above-normal risk for significant wildfires from June through August.\n\nA late May 2025 weather forecast for the Bay Area noted a period of unusual weather activity, including a forecasted hot weather event followed by a sharp cooldown. The same forecast mentioned the potential formation of Tropical Storm Alvin in the Eastern Pacific. According to the report, this storm system could track northwest towards California and interact with a low-pressure system, potentially bringing widespread storm activity and rainfall. This was to be followed by a trough of low pressure from Canada, resulting in below-average temperatures and showers.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "30 days (from May 29 to June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Currently 22.7 million residents are in drought, which is 2.7 million above the 20.0 million threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Significant rainfall from Tropical Storm Alvin and/or the forecasted weather systems brings enough precipitation across California to rapidly improve drought conditions, reducing the population in drought areas by more than 2.7 million residents within 30 days. Multiple substantial rain events would be needed to reclassify enough areas from drought status.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The drought persists as NOAA predicts, with June's typically dry conditions and forecasted above-normal temperatures preventing significant improvement. Any precipitation from potential weather systems is insufficient to drop the drought-affected population below 20.0 million in the short timeframe available.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. As of May 27, 2025, California has 22.7 million residents in drought areas - already 2.7 million above the resolution threshold with only 30 days remaining. Several factors support this continuing: (1) NOAA's Climate Prediction Center specifically forecasts drought persisting through August 2025, which encompasses the June 28 resolution date; (2) June is historically one of California's driest months, making significant drought improvement unlikely through natural precipitation patterns; (3) Forecasted extreme heat and above-normal temperatures would exacerbate rather than alleviate drought conditions; (4) Drought classifications typically change slowly, as they reflect cumulative soil moisture, precipitation deficits, and other long-term indicators. While the research mentions potential rainfall from Tropical Storm Alvin and a Canadian trough system, these are uncertain prospects that may not materialize or deliver sufficient widespread precipitation to reverse drought classifications across large population centers within just 30 days. For the threshold to be breached (No outcome), California would need exceptional rainfall that dramatically improves conditions across regions containing 2.7+ million residents - an unlikely scenario given the short timeframe, seasonal patterns, and expert forecasts. My forecast is not higher because weather systems do carry some uncertainty and one or two significant precipitation events could provide modest improvement. It's not lower because the buffer above threshold is relatively small in absolute terms but the timeframe is very short for meaningful drought recovery, and all indicators point to persistence rather than rapid improvement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the resolution source, drought.gov, approximately 22.7 million California residents were living in areas of drought (classified as D1-D4) as of the week of May 27, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
