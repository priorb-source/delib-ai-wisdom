    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 13 days (until May 5, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han, serving as acting president, emphasizes neutrality and declines to run; PPP coalesces around another candidate, and no candidacy announcement from Han occurs before May 5.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mounting pressure inside the PPP to draft Han succeeds; he accepts and makes a formal public announcement of candidacy before May 5 (likely paired with or followed by steps to relinquish acting presidential duties to comply with norms/law).",
    "rationale": "- Context and base rate: In South Korea’s most comparable recent case (2017), acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn ultimately declined to run amid neutrality concerns. That precedent and the general norm that caretakers avoid leveraging the office for electoral gain weigh toward No.\n- Institutional/legal frictions: As acting president/prime minister, Han would likely face legal and strong normative expectations to step aside to run. That adds practical and reputational costs to announcing, making a last‑minute candidacy less likely.\n- Timing: With roughly two weeks left, a candidacy would need to be announced imminently, which usually follows visible pre‑signals (organizational moves, explicit trial balloons). Absent such signals in the provided materials, the status quo (no announcement) is favored.\n- Political calculus: Han is in his mid‑70s and would be launching a five‑year presidential bid in a compressed timeline. The PPP has other potential figures, reducing pressure on Han personally. While the referenced report suggests growing support to draft him, draft movements often fail, especially for sitting caretakers.\n- Why not higher: Norms against caretaker runs, likely resignation requirements, age/tenure considerations, and the availability of alternative PPP candidates collectively make a quick announcement unlikely.\n- Why not lower: The cited reporting indicates real intra‑party momentum to draft Han for a June election. If the PPP consolidates rapidly behind him, he could announce on short notice, so the probability isn’t negligible.\n- What would move the forecast up: Credible reports that Han is actively exploring a run; PPP formal requests or endorsements urging him to run; indications he’s arranging to step down from acting duties; scheduling of a party primary timeline that necessitates his quick decision.\n- What would move it down: A public statement from Han ruling out a run; PPP coalescing behind another candidate; legal/administrative guidance underscoring he must resign to run and signals he won’t; any health or political developments reducing feasibility.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information provided beyond the linked headline; thus, weighting status quo and historical precedent more heavily.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Han Duck-soo announce his candidacy for South Korean president before May 5, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Chosun Daily: [Support grows in PPP to draft Acting President Han for June election](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464554)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Han Duck-soo announces his candidacy for president of South Korea before May 5, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
