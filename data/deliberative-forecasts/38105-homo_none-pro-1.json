    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. Forecaster 3's reasoning aligns almost perfectly with my own, emphasizing the persistent political paralysis, the opposition of entrenched elites to necessary reforms (especially on loss allocation), and the extremely short one-month timeline. We both arrived at a 5% probability based on these same strong, status-quo drivers.\n\nForecaster 2, with a 12% forecast, presents a slightly more optimistic case. Their reasoning is also grounded in the political deadlock but assigns more weight to potential catalysts like the 'dire economic situation,' the possibility of a 'sudden shock,' and potential flexibility from the IMF to prevent a failed state. I find the argument about potential IMF flexibility to be the most compelling point I hadn't explicitly detailed. However, I believe Forecaster 2 overweights these factors. The dire economic situation has been the status quo for years without forcing a resolution, and the internal political gridlock in Lebanon has proven to be a more powerful force than external pressure or IMF incentives. Even with a more flexible IMF, the Lebanese parliament would still need to pass politically explosive legislation in an impossibly short timeframe.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. The other forecasters reinforced my core belief that the primary obstacle is the deep-rooted political gridlock in Lebanon, which has prevented the implementation of required reforms for over three years. My reasoning remains unchanged: the political elite have consistently demonstrated an unwillingness to enact reforms, such as banking restructuring and capital controls, that would negatively impact their own interests. With only one month remaining until the deadline, the time is insufficient to overcome years of legislative inertia and political animosity.\n\nWhile Forecaster 2 rightly pointed out that the IMF may show some flexibility to prevent a total collapse, I do not believe this is sufficient to overcome the fundamental problem. Any meaningful agreement would still require Lebanese political factions to pass painful legislation and agree on how to allocate tens of billions of dollars in financial losses—a step they have steadfastly refused to take. The track record of inaction is a far stronger predictor than the theoretical possibility of a last-minute compromise. Therefore, the probability of an agreement remains very low, reflecting the small chance of an unforeseen event forcing a break in the long-standing stalemate.",
