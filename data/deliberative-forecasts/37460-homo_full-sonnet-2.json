    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I initially underweighted. Forecaster 3 identifies the most crucial piece of evidence: the question background explicitly states the Global Protest Tracker 'uses the name Türkiye in its database.' This note wouldn't be included unless the tracker actively covers Turkey, which significantly reduces my uncertainty about whether these protests will be documented. Both forecasters also emphasize an important point I didn't stress enough: there are TWO pathways to Yes - either the tracker reports on the massive March-May protests that already occurred, or new large protests happen in the remaining 55 days. Given the CHP's stated commitment to continued protests, upcoming trigger events (trials on May 30 and July 7), persistent economic distress (48.6% inflation), and demonstrated organizational capacity, the probability of at least one qualifying event being reported seems higher than my initial 72%. The convergence of both forecasters at 82% with well-reasoned arguments about why not higher (tracker uncertainty) and why not lower (extraordinary scale and multiple pathways) is persuasive.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too conservative at 72%. The explicit mention that the tracker uses 'Türkiye' in its database strongly suggests active coverage of Turkey - the question writers wouldn't include this detail otherwise. This substantially reduces my concern about whether the tracker will document Turkish protests at all. Combined with the massive scale of recent protests (hundreds of thousands to potentially 2 million participants), the ongoing political crisis, high inflation, and CHP's commitment to continued demonstrations, the probability should be higher. The dual pathway - either past events being reported OR future qualifying events occurring in 55 days - increases the likelihood. While government crackdowns and potential reporting lags create some uncertainty, the extraordinary scale of documented protests and volatile conditions make documentation highly probable. My updated forecast aligns with the other forecasters' well-reasoned convergence at 82%.",
