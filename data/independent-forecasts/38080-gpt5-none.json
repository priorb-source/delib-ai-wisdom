    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 34 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Harvard’s SEVP certification was revoked on May 22, 2025, and absent a reversal or court order, it will remain uncertified on July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Litigation and administrative appeals do not yield emergency relief before July 1. A district court denies a TRO/preliminary injunction (or an appellate court/Supreme Court stays any lower-court order), DHS maintains the revocation, and Harvard remains without an active SEVP certification on July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Harvard obtains a TRO or preliminary injunction compelling DHS/ICE to restore SEVP certification pending litigation, and DHS implements it in SEVIS before or on July 1; or DHS reverses course and reinstates certification (possibly provisionally) by July 1.",
    "rationale": "Time is short, the status quo is decertification, and agency actions in immigration/national-security-adjacent domains often receive judicial deference. These features tilt baseline odds slightly toward No. However, there is a plausible and timely path to Yes via emergency injunctive relief. Courts often grant TROs when there is clear irreparable harm and serious legal questions, and thousands of international students facing imminent loss of status is strong irreparable harm. Harvard likely argues that DHS’s action was arbitrary/capricious under the APA or procedurally deficient (e.g., inadequate notice and opportunity to respond). Even if ultimate merits are uncertain, a court could preserve the status quo ante (restored certification) while litigation proceeds. Against this, the government can invoke statutory discretion and campus safety/national security rationales; some courts may require or heavily weigh administrative exhaustion; and the government could rapidly seek and possibly obtain a stay from the appellate courts, re-suspending any restoration before July 1. Voluntary administrative reinstatement seems less likely given the current political posture, but cannot be ruled out entirely. My research assistant provided no additional information beyond public context, so I’m weighting general legal/administrative dynamics and recent timing. Why not higher: deference to DHS, potential exhaustion hurdles, tight timeline, and likelihood of government seeking an emergency stay. Why not lower: strong equities for students, Harvard’s legal capacity, and courts’ willingness in analogous higher-ed/immigration disputes to grant short-term relief. I would move higher if (1) Harvard files and gets a quick hearing date on a TRO in a favorable venue, (2) any district judge signals skepticism of DHS’s process, or (3) DHS suggests willingness to provisionally reinstate. I would move lower if (1) a court denies TRO, (2) an appellate court stays any restoration order, or (3) credible reporting shows DHS followed exhaustive procedures that courts typically uphold.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
