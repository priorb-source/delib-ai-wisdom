    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "25 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the agreement remains in place without formal cancellation announcement",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing financial pressures and political discussions between Borissov and Erdogan, no formal announcement of cancellation is made by either party before July 1, 2025. Negotiations continue but the complex legal and diplomatic process of terminating an international energy agreement extends beyond the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The financial crisis facing Bulgargaz, combined with high-level political engagement between Bulgaria and Turkey, leads to an urgent formal announcement by either party that they are cancelling or terminating the gas transmission agreement within the next 25 days.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a NO resolution for several reasons. First, only 25 days remain until the deadline - an extremely short timeframe for formal cancellation of an international energy transmission agreement. Such agreements typically involve complex legal procedures, termination clauses with notice periods, and diplomatic considerations that require time to navigate. Second, while the evidence shows serious problems (Bulgargaz near bankruptcy, Borissov pressing Erdogan for an exit), these indicate ongoing pressure rather than imminent resolution. Political leaders expressing a need to exit an agreement is different from actually executing that exit. Third, the research assistant found no additional information suggesting an imminent announcement. However, the probability is not negligible because: (1) high-level political engagement has occurred between heads of government, suggesting the issue is elevated, (2) financial urgency (bankruptcy threat) could theoretically force rapid action, (3) the resolution criteria only requires an announcement of cancellation by either party, not actual contract termination, and (4) crisis situations can occasionally produce faster-than-normal diplomatic actions. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of: active negotiations toward cancellation, public statements indicating imminent action, or leaked information about planned announcements. For it to move lower, I would need evidence that negotiations have stalled or that both parties are committed to maintaining the agreement despite difficulties.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Botas Gas Agreement between Bulgaria and Turkey be cancelled before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Borissov to Erdogan: Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal](https://www.novinite.com/articles/232423/Borissov+to+Erdogan%3A+Bulgaria+Needs+Out+of+the+Botas+Gas+Deal) | [Bulgargaz on verge of bankrupty due to debts to Turkish gas company BOTAS: Turkish media](https://www.turkiyetoday.com/business/bulgargaz-on-verge-of-bankrupty-due-to-debts-to-turkish-gas-company-botas-turkish-med-3201881)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, the natural gas transmission agreement between Bulgargaz EAD and BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corp is announced by either party as being cancelled.\n\nTermination of the agreement by either side, even if denied by the other side, would still count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
