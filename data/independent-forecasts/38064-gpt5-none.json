    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~16 days (until June 12, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — public companies almost always hold and complete their annual meeting on the scheduled date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Significant technical issues (e.g., webcast/vendor failure from heavy retail interest) force adjournment; or quorum isn’t reached for a key item and the meeting is adjourned to solicit more votes; or the company reschedules the meeting to a different date for logistical/legal reasons. Any of these would mean the meeting does not fully complete on June 12.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The meeting (likely virtual or tightly controlled access) proceeds on June 12 with sufficient quorum from advance proxies, the platform handles traffic, all agenda items are voted, and the meeting adjourns sine die that day.",
    "rationale": "- Base rates: The vast majority of U.S. public-company annual meetings occur and complete on the announced date (>90% by experience/industry norms). That supports a Yes by default.\n- GME-specific risk: In 2024, GameStop’s virtual meeting experienced a crash/adjournment amid intense retail interest (CNBC). This elevates the company-specific probability of a delay relative to the base rate.\n- Mitigations vs. repeat risk: After a high-profile failure, firms typically change providers, capacity, or participation rules (shareholder verification, pre-registration, read-only streams) to reduce load and ensure quorum. That argues for improved execution in 2025. However, if retail enthusiasm surges again (e.g., viral events, influencer attention) or contentious proposals require supermajority/extra solicitation, adjournment risk returns.\n- Format uncertainty: If it’s virtual-only, platform risk remains the key failure mode; if it’s in-person or hybrid, risks shift to crowd control/logistics but are generally lower for completion on the day.\n- Status quo weighting: Given that the world usually changes slowly and companies learn from prior failures, I weight the status quo (meeting completes on the planned date) more heavily than a repeat of last year’s disruption, but I keep a meaningful discount for GME’s idiosyncratic attention risk.\n- Research assistant input: No new information provided (e.g., definitive proxy with date/format, vendor choice, agenda). Lack of confirming details justifies not going higher.\nWhy not higher: Non-trivial chance of adjournment due to technical load, quorum challenges on any contentious proposal, or a last-minute reschedule.\nWhy not lower: Corporate base rates are strong, and post-2024 learnings likely reduce failure probability this year.\nWhat would move me up: Confirmation of robust meeting logistics (e.g., different/webcast vendor with capacity details, restricted access to verified holders), confirmation of a routine agenda without supermajority items, or evidence of muted retail attention.\nWhat would move me down: Signals of renewed meme-stock frenzy, open access links likely to attract non-holders, contentious proposals needing high thresholds, litigation/injunction risk, or any notice of potential adjournment.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Gamestop annual meeting take place on June 12, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNBC (2024): [Servers for GameStop annual shareholder meeting crash due to overwhelming interest](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/13/gamestop-annual-shareholder-meeting-2024-servers-crash.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Gamestop's 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders is held on June 12, 2025.\n\nThe meeting is considered to have been held when it fully completed. For example, if the meeting begins but is then postponed due to server issues, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
