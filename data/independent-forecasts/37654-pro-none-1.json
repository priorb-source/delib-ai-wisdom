    "no_outcome_scenario": "A new presidential administration, inaugurated in January 2025, takes preliminary steps towards reorganizing NOAA. This could involve issuing executive orders or proposing budgetary changes. However, these actions face immediate legal challenges and strong political opposition in Congress. Due to the inherent slowness of legislative and bureaucratic processes, the agency is not fundamentally broken up by July 1, 2025, and the trackers leave its status as 'in progress'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In an unprecedented display of speed and political power, a new administration with large, unified majorities in Congress makes this a 'Day One' priority. Legislation to dissolve NOAA is attached to a must-pass bill and becomes law in the first quarter of 2025. A series of immediate and legally resilient executive orders reassigns all of NOAA's functions and assets to other departments. By June 2025, the process is so definitive that the spreadsheet maintainers agree the objective has been 'complete'd.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the extremely short timeline and the immense difficulty of dismantling a major federal agency. The status quo is that the objective is 'in progress' and the forces of inertia are very strong. Breaking up an agency like NOAA is a monumental task that would typically take years of legislative battles, regulatory rewrites, and legal challenges. To achieve this in the approximately five months between a new administration taking office (January 20, 2025) and the resolution date (July 1, 2025) is nearly impossible. Such an action would face fierce resistance from a wide array of stakeholders, including the scientific community, environmental groups, coastal states, and the industries that rely on NOAA data, not to mention significant political opposition. The spreadsheet's maintainers are likely to have a high bar for what constitutes 'complete,' and preliminary steps like issuing an executive order that gets immediately tied up in court would not suffice. The lack of any additional information from my research assistant reinforces that no extraordinary developments are currently underway. My probability is not zero because the definition of 'complete' is subjective to the spreadsheet owners, and a sufficiently sweeping executive action could, in theory, be deemed enough by them. My probability is not higher because the political, legal, and logistical barriers to actually breaking up NOAA in under six months are formidable. I would raise my probability if I saw evidence of a successful, fast-tracked legislative effort with overwhelming support, or a series of court rulings affirming a radical executive reorganization of the agency.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of breaking up NOAA marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"break up the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
