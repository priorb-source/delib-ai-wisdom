    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. India has a high frequency of large-scale protests, and it is likely that at least one exceeding 10,000 participants will occur and be reported by the tracker within the given timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No new major protests attracting over 10,000 people begin in May or June 2025. Alternatively, a large protest does occur, but the Global Protest Tracker does not update its database to include it before the July 1, 2025 deadline due to reporting or verification lags.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A contentious political, social, or economic issue, such as the land law mentioned in the background information, triggers mass demonstrations in a major Indian city. The protest draws well over 10,000 participants, receives significant media attention, and is subsequently added to the Global Protest Tracker's database before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 70% is based on three main factors: India's high base rate for large protests, current political tensions, and the specific resolution criteria. \n\n1. High Base Rate: India, as the world's largest democracy with a population of over 1.4 billion, has a well-established history of frequent, large-scale public demonstrations. A review of the Global Protest Tracker's own historical data shows multiple entries for India each year that meet the 10,000+ participant threshold. Issues ranging from agricultural reforms (e.g., the 2020-21 farmers' protests) to citizenship laws consistently mobilize massive crowds. The status quo is one of regular mass protest.\n\n2. Current Context: The provided background information about a violent protest in April 2025 over a land law indicates that the current socio-political environment is tense and conducive to further unrest. Such flashpoints are common and often serve as catalysts for large-scale mobilization.\n\n3. Resolution Criteria (The primary source of uncertainty): The main reason my forecast is not higher is the reliance on a single, specific source—the Global Protest Tracker—and a fixed deadline. This tracker is a curated research project, not a live news feed, and there can be significant lags between when a protest occurs and when it is documented. A protest in late June, for example, may not be added before July 1. This reporting lag is the most significant factor that could lead to a 'No' outcome.\n\nConversely, the forecast is not lower because the two-month window is substantial enough to make the reporting of a major protest likely. The sheer frequency and scale of protests in India make it more probable than not that an event will both occur and be documented in time.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of a specific large protest being planned for May or early June. I would decrease it if the identified tensions de-escalated significantly or if evidence emerged that the Global Protest Tracker has a multi-month reporting lag.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in India with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nA protest with at least 10,000 participants that is active at the launch of this question does not count for resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
