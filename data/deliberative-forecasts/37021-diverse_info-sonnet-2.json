    "review": "Both forecasters provided crucial data I completely missed in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's concrete numbers are devastating to my original forecast: Ukraine's inflation was 12.9% (Jan), 13.4% (Feb), and 14.6% (March). I was treating this as a wider uncertainty problem when in fact we're already at 14.6% - only 0.4 percentage points away from the 15% threshold. Forecaster 2's technical analysis of the monthly inflation dynamics and base effects is compelling, showing that relatively modest continued pressure could push us over. The specific category data (food +17.4% YoY, housing/utilities +20.2% YoY) demonstrates broad-based pressure, not just isolated spikes. Forecaster 3's emphasis on recent shocks (energy infrastructure attacks, Easter food basket at +18-19% YoY) reinforces the supply-side pressure narrative. Both forecasters correctly identify that the NBU's expectation of a Q2 peak is consistent with April hitting 15% before declining later. My initial 30% forecast was far too conservative given we're already at 14.6%. However, I find Forecaster 2's 70% slightly high - March's 1.5% m/m included some volatile components (eggs +18.8% m/m) that could partially reverse, and the NBU's active management plus weak demand do provide meaningful brakes. Forecaster 3's 60% appropriately balances the momentum argument with countervailing forces.",
    "rationale": "My critical error was not having the actual recent inflation data. Starting from 14.6% in March fundamentally changes the analysis - we need only 0.4 pp increase to reach 15%, not the several percentage points I implicitly assumed. The momentum from March's strong 1.5% m/m increase, combined with structural war-related pressures (energy infrastructure damage, labor shortages, food supply issues), makes crossing the threshold quite plausible. The NBU explicitly expects Q2 inflation to peak, which is consistent with April reaching 15% even if year-end settles at 8.7%. However, I'm not going as high as 70% because: (1) volatile March components like eggs could normalize; (2) seasonal factors may moderate; (3) the NBU's 15.5% policy rate and weak demand constrain pass-through; (4) we're late enough in April that if inflation were catastrophically high, we'd likely see more alarm signals. The question essentially asks whether April's month-over-month increase will be sufficient to push YoY up 0.4 pp - a modest but not guaranteed outcome given the base effects and current pressures.",
