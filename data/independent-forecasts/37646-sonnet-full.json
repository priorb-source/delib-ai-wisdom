  "information": "Somalia's National Communications Authority granted Starlink a full operating license in mid-April 2025, following approximately two and a half years of discussions. On April 13, 2025, Elon Musk announced on social media, \"Starlink is in Somalia.\" At a ceremony in Mogadishu, Starlink representatives stated the service would be available nationwide soon. Somali government officials, including the Minister of Communications and Technology, publicly welcomed the service, highlighting its potential to provide internet access across the country. As of mid-May 2025, the official Starlink availability map listed Somalia as \"Not Available\" or \"Coming Soon.\"\n\nThe time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming \"Available\" varies. For several African nations, the lag has been several months: Nigeria's service went live approximately four months after licensing in 2023, while Rwanda's took about four months. The median time for recent African launches has been estimated at 4–8 months. However, some rollouts have been much faster; for example, Bangladesh's service became available in about two weeks in May 2025. Conversely, some countries, such as Zambia, India, and Vietnam, have remained in a \"Coming Soon\" status for many months after receiving licenses.\n\nStarlink can provide service to Somalia without an in-country gateway station due to its use of inter-satellite laser links, which can connect to ground stations in neighboring countries like Kenya or Ethiopia. A report by the Washington Post indicated that the U.S. government has been diplomatically promoting Starlink's expansion in various countries, including Somalia. Local challenges in Somalia include a fragile security environment, complex import logistics for user terminals, and difficulties with payment processing infrastructure. According to 2022 World Bank data, about 30% of Somalia's 18 million people have internet access.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days (6.5 weeks) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Somalia remains listed as 'Not Available' or 'Coming Soon' on the Starlink availability map",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Starlink follows its typical deployment timeline for African countries (4-8 months median), meaning Somalia wouldn't reach 'Available' status until late summer or fall 2025, well after the July 1 deadline. Technical preparations, terminal imports, payment infrastructure setup, or security considerations cause delays beyond the 2.5-month window from license grant to resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink accelerates Somalia's rollout similar to the Bangladesh deployment (2 weeks in May 2025). Leveraging inter-satellite laser links to existing ground stations in Kenya/Ethiopia eliminates the need for in-country infrastructure. Strong diplomatic pressure from the U.S. government and political will from Somalia's government drive rapid deployment. The service becomes 'Available' on the map within the next 6.5 weeks, approximately 2.5 months after the April license grant.",
    "rationale": "The license was granted in mid-April 2025, approximately one month ago. The resolution date of July 1, 2025 is 6.5 weeks away, meaning the total time from license to potential availability would be about 2.5 months. Historical data shows the median African rollout takes 4-8 months (Nigeria and Rwanda each took ~4 months), which strongly suggests the July 1 deadline is too soon. However, the May 2025 Bangladesh deployment (approximately 2 weeks) demonstrates that rapid rollouts are possible under favorable conditions. Somalia benefits from not requiring an in-country gateway station due to inter-satellite laser links. The announcement that service would be available 'soon' and Musk's public declaration suggest genuine intent for rapid deployment. However, Somalia faces significant challenges: fragile security environment, complex import logistics, and payment infrastructure difficulties that Bangladesh likely didn't face to the same degree. At 2.5 months post-license, Somalia would need to be substantially faster than the typical African deployment but not as fast as Bangladesh. The status quo heavily favors 'No' since as of mid-May, Somalia is still listed as 'Not Available' or 'Coming Soon.' My forecast is not higher because the historical precedent strongly suggests 4+ months is typical for African deployments, and Somalia has legitimate operational challenges. My forecast is not lower because the Bangladesh precedent proves rapid deployment is possible, no ground station is required, and there's strong political backing. For me to update higher, I'd need to see concrete evidence of imminent launch (announcements, terminal availability, pre-orders going live). To update lower, I'd need to see Starlink announcing delays or extending 'Coming Soon' timelines.",
