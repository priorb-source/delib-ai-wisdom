    "review": "The convergence across all three forecasts (70%, 72%, 72%) is striking and validates the analytical approach. We all identified the same key factors: Liberal Democrat status quo advantage (37 seats in 2021), strong regional presence, proximity to election day limiting time for major shifts, uncertainty from Cornwall's Independent tradition, and lack of current polling data. Forecaster 2's specific mention of the 5-seat margin over Conservatives (37 vs 32) provides useful quantification - this is substantial but not overwhelming, supporting moderate rather than high confidence. Forecaster 3's points about Conservative national difficulties and Labour's traditional weakness in Cornwall are reasonable contextual factors, though national trends don't always translate directly to local elections. The observation about possible council composition changes since 2021 (by-elections, defections) is valid but speculative without data. No forecaster introduced evidence that materially challenges the 70-72% range, and the consensus actually strengthens confidence in this probability band.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain my assessment that the Liberal Democrats are strong favorites to retain the most seats, but not to the point of near-certainty. The deliberation reinforced rather than challenged my key reasoning: (1) Status quo persistence is the baseline expectation only 10 days before an election, (2) The Liberal Democrats' 37-seat position from 2021 represents a clear but not overwhelming plurality, (3) Cornwall's strong Independent presence creates genuine uncertainty that prevents higher confidence, (4) Without polling or recent by-election data, we must rely on historical patterns and structural factors. The convergence of all three forecasts around 70-72% suggests this range appropriately captures the balance between the strong status quo baseline and the meaningful uncertainties. No new evidence emerged that would justify moving significantly higher or lower from this band.",
