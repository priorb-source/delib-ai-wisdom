    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I initially underweighted. They correctly emphasize that companies with hundreds of millions in net cash, positive free cash flow, and no near-term debt maturities rarely file bankruptcy within 60-day windows, regardless of business struggles. Forecaster 3's point about bankruptcy destroying brand value when alternatives exist (reverse split, M&A, cost cuts) is particularly strong - these are rational next steps before filing. Forecaster 2 correctly distinguishes between long-term distress indicators and immediate insolvency triggers. However, I think both may be slightly underweighting the tail risk given: (1) the severity of the negative Altman Z-score of -3.31, (2) nine consecutive quarters of revenue decline representing sustained deterioration, (3) the extreme stock price collapse to $0.51-$0.65 signaling market expectations of very poor outcomes, and (4) the possibility that Q1 earnings could reveal undisclosed problems or accelerated cash burn. The base rate argument is convincing but not absolute.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too anchored on distress signals without properly weighting the protective factors. The key insight from both forecasters is that bankruptcy is triggered by inability to meet obligations, not just business struggles. With several hundred million in net cash, positive FCF, and no debt maturities until 2026, Chegg has substantial liquidity cushion. Even catastrophic Q1 results on May 12 would be unlikely to exhaust this cash position by July 1 - only 50 days later. The base rate of bankruptcy filings within 57 days for companies with this liquidity profile is extremely low. Additionally, management has value-preserving alternatives (reverse split for NYSE compliance, strategic alternatives including M&A or privatization, continued cost reduction) that would be pursued before filing. However, I maintain slightly higher probability than 3% because: the Z-score of -3.31 indicates severe financial distress, the sustained business deterioration creates genuine tail risks of undisclosed problems, and strategic bankruptcy (using Chapter 11 as a sale mechanism) remains a non-zero possibility if the Q1 report or subsequent events are catastrophic. Reducing my forecast from 10% to 5%.",
