  "information": "Colombia has declared a national health emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, there have been 79 reported cases and 36 deaths since 2024, with the departments of Tolima and Putumayo being the most affected. The government has implemented mobility restrictions in high-risk areas and vaccination requirements for travelers. In response to rising cases in South America, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a level 2 travel notice for the continent, citing spread to newly affected areas in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The yellow fever outbreak remains contained within South America. While individual travel-associated cases might be detected in North America, they do not lead to sustained local transmission, and therefore the CDC does not issue a specific travel advisory for any North American country.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The outbreak in Colombia spreads across the border into Panama, a North American country. An infected traveler or mosquito crosses the Darién Gap, leading to confirmed cases of local transmission in Panama. In response, the CDC issues a travel health notice for Panama before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the current geographic scope of the outbreak and the short time remaining until the resolution date. The status quo is that no North American country has a CDC yellow fever advisory; the current advisory is for South America. This is a strong starting point, as situations like this often evolve slowly. The primary risk factor is the outbreak in Colombia spreading northward. The most likely candidate for this would be Panama, given its shared border. For the question to resolve as 'Yes', the virus would need to be introduced, establish a local human-mosquito-human transmission cycle, be detected by public health authorities, and then trigger a formal CDC travel advisory, all within the next five weeks. This is a rapid chain of events that is unlikely to be completed in such a short period. The existing public health surveillance and control measures in Central American countries, particularly at borders, are designed to prevent such spread. My forecast is not lower because the ongoing outbreak in South America is serious, as indicated by the PAHO alert, and the required mosquito vector is present in many parts of North America, making a cross-border spread plausible. My forecast is not higher because of the significant logistical and biological hurdles for the virus to establish a recognized outbreak in a new country within the tight deadline. I would increase my probability if there were credible reports of confirmed local transmission cases in Panama or another Central American country. I would decrease it if reports indicated the outbreak in Colombia was being successfully contained.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country in North America is listed as having a travel advisory by the Centers for Disease Control at its [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices) page when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nColombia has declared a national health emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, there have been 79 reported cases and 36 deaths since 2024, with the departments of Tolima and Putumayo being the most affected.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
