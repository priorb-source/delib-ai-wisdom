    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1–3 weeks (NBS likely publishes the May CPI around June 12; the FRED series usually updates a few days to ~2 weeks after).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — May 2025 CPI year-over-year remains negative, extending the streak to four months.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Labor Day travel/services inflation, a rebound in pork prices, and slightly higher fuel costs nudge headline CPI to around 0.0% to +0.2% year-over-year, breaking the deflation streak.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Food prices (notably pork and vegetables) stay soft, core goods remain weak amid the property slump and tepid demand, and energy effects are muted; headline CPI year-over-year stays below zero for May.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: With today being 2025-06-02, we’re roughly 10 days from the NBS May CPI release; FRED will reflect it shortly after. The outcome hinges on whether CHNCPIALLMINMEI (YoY, NSA) is negative for May 2025.\n- Status quo: The SCMP report notes CPI fell in April, and broader context in 2025 has been repeated mild headline declines amid weak domestic demand and continued property-sector drag. Given three consecutive negative prints heading into May, the status quo points to deflation persisting another month.\n- Fundamentals: Core services may have received a temporary lift from the early-May Labor Day holiday, but core strength has been modest overall. Food (large CPI weight) has been a key drag—pork oversupply and generally soft food prices—while PPI remains in deflation, consistent with subdued goods pricing power. Energy prices are not providing a strong positive impulse versus a year ago. These factors make another slightly negative YoY headline plausible.\n- Base effects: May 2024 CPI was low but not deeply negative, so base effects are not strongly inflationary. With weak month-to-month momentum through spring, the YoY headline can remain below zero even if m/m prices tick up seasonally.\n- Why not higher: There is a real risk that holiday-related services, any rebound in pork, or marginal fuel increases push the headline to flat or slightly positive, especially given how close to zero recent readings have been.\n- Why not lower: Policymakers have been leaning more supportive and core inflation is positive, limiting the depth of deflation. A sharp negative surprise would likely require an outsized fresh-food decline or unexpected commodity weakness, which isn’t my base case.\n- What would move me: I’d raise the probability if high-frequency data (pork/veg prices) for May show continued declines and if PPI remains firmly negative. I’d lower it if we see evidence of a strong May services bump, a clear pork price rebound, or reports of higher fuel/transport costs feeding through to CPI.\n- Assistant’s info: No extra data provided; forecast leans on continuity and widely reported April weakness.\nOverall, continuity and weak demand point modestly toward another negative YoY print, but proximity to zero and holiday effects keep uncertainty meaningful.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
