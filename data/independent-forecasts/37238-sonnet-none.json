    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Unknown, but likely several weeks to months. UFC 316 appears to be a future numbered pay-per-view event. Without access to the UFC schedule, UFC 316 is probably scheduled for late May through summer 2025, given UFC events occur roughly monthly.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Trump does not attend",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump's presidential schedule conflicts with the event date, or UFC 316 takes place in a location that's logistically challenging for a presidential visit. Security concerns, political priorities, or international obligations prevent his attendance. The event may not feature high-profile enough matchups to warrant a presidential appearance.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "UFC 316 is held in Florida near Mar-a-Lago or another location convenient to Trump's schedule. The event features a championship fight or other highly anticipated matchup. Trump's friend Dana White extends a personal invitation and Trump's schedule allows for it. His recent April 13 attendance at a UFC event shows his willingness to attend as sitting President.",
    "rationale": "Trump has a documented relationship with UFC President Dana White and attended a UFC event on April 13, 2025 (17 days ago), demonstrating he does attend UFC events as President. However, this doesn't mean he attends most or even many UFC events. The UFC holds approximately 12-13 numbered pay-per-view events annually, plus many smaller Fight Night events. Even an enthusiastic fan with presidential duties can't attend all of them. The base rate for presidential attendance at any given UFC event is likely low, perhaps 10-20% for numbered PPV events. The recent April attendance provides some positive evidence but also suggests he may have satisfied his UFC attendance for the near term. Without knowing UFC 316's specific date, location, or card significance, I must rely on base rates. Status quo strongly favors non-attendance for any randomly selected event. My forecast would increase significantly if: UFC 316 were in Florida, featured a major championship fight, or occurred during a time we knew Trump would be nearby. My forecast would decrease if: the event were far from Trump's typical locations, during major political events, or if we learned Trump had other commitments. Given the lack of specific information and strong base rate considerations toward non-attendance, I estimate a 20% probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend UFC 316?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Trump and Some of His Cabinet Members Attend U.F.C. Fight in Miami](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/trump-ufc-fight-reyes.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump is anywhere within the grounds of the venue where [UFC 316](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-316) takes place. Otherwise this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
