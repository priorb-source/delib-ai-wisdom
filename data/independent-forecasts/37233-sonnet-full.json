  "information": "In a January 2025 address to the diplomatic corps, President Alassane Ouattara stated he was in 'perfect health and ready to continue serving my country', but clarified that he had 'not yet made a decision' regarding a candidacy in the October 2025 presidential election. He noted that his party, the RHDP, has at least a dozen potential candidates. Previously, in 2020, Ouattara had announced his intention to step down but reversed this decision to run for a third term after the sudden death of his designated successor.\n\nPresident Ouattara's party, the RHDP, has referred to him as its 'natural candidate' and has been calling for him to run since 2024. In late December 2024, Minister of State Anne Désirée Ouloto announced Ouattara would be the candidate. Similarly, in early January 2025, Minister of Transport Amadou KONÉ stated that Ouattara 'will be the candidate of the RHDP in October 2025.' In late April 2025, a supporter group, the Jeunesse pour la Renaissance du Grand Nord (JRGN), held a press conference publicly calling on Ouattara to run.\n\nSeveral key opposition figures face eligibility challenges ahead of the 2025 election. In late April 2025, a court ruled that potential challenger Tidjane Thiam, leader of the PDCI party, was ineligible to run for president due to his French nationality. Former President Laurent Gbagbo was excluded from electoral lists in 2023 following a conviction for embezzlement. Another political figure, Guillaume Soro, remains in exile and is ineligible due to a 2021 conviction; in April 2025, a trial began for his former aide-de-camp for an alleged coup attempt against Ouattara.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ouattara has not declared his candidacy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ouattara continues his strategic delay past June 1, 2025, possibly waiting for party conventions, official nomination deadlines, or to maintain political leverage as opposition candidates face legal challenges. He may prefer to let the uncertainty benefit his party's positioning.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ouattara formally announces his candidacy in the coming weeks, following the pattern established by party officials who have been declaring him as the candidate since late 2024. With major opposition figures ruled ineligible and strong party pressure, he makes an official declaration before June 1.",
    "rationale": "The status quo is that Ouattara has NOT formally declared, stating explicitly in January 2025 that he had 'not yet made a decision.' However, multiple strong indicators point toward eventual candidacy: (1) Party officials have been announcing him as the candidate since December 2024, (2) He emphasized being in 'perfect health and ready to continue serving,' (3) He reversed a retirement decision in 2020 to run for a third term, (4) Major opposition figures are being systematically eliminated through legal rulings (Thiam ruled ineligible in late April 2025), (5) His party calls him the 'natural candidate' and supporter groups are publicly urging him to run. The critical question is timing - will he declare before the specific June 1 deadline? Against declaration: He has already delayed 4+ months since January despite party pressure, suggesting strategic timing considerations or genuine indecision. The June 1 date appears somewhat arbitrary without clear connection to official deadlines. In favor of declaration: The mounting pressure, weakened opposition, and pattern of party announcements suggest an announcement is coming. My forecast is not higher because Ouattara's explicit statement about not deciding, combined with his 4-month delay, indicates he may continue waiting past June 1. It's not lower because the overwhelming party support, his health emphasis, historical pattern of reversing retirement, and systematic opposition elimination all point toward eventual candidacy. An earlier statement from Ouattara indicating imminent announcement would push this higher; any health concerns or statements about delaying would push it lower.",
