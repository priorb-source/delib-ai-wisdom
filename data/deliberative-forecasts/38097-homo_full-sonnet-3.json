    "review": "Both forecasters raise compelling points that strengthen the case for a higher probability. Their emphasis on 'multiple independent sources' confirming Gbagbo's disqualification is persuasive, and they correctly highlight that the resolution criteria explicitly includes 'otherwise become legally ineligible' - not just formal removal from electoral lists. This is crucial because Gbagbo's loss of civic rights from his 2018 conviction appears to be a matter of legal record, satisfying the eligibility criterion regardless of administrative list updates. They also effectively emphasize the short 32-day timeframe remaining and the well-documented pattern of opposition disqualifications in Côte d'Ivoire. However, I note we all share similar reservations about potential reporting errors, legal reversals, and the significance of Gbagbo's party planning to 'fight' his status in early June. The main analytical difference is that Forecasters 2 and 3 appear more confident that the existing evidence of Gbagbo's legal ineligibility is sufficient, while I was more cautious about whether this constitutes a 'disqualification' for the 2025 election specifically versus ongoing ineligibility from 2018.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my initial forecast was slightly too conservative. The key insight is that the question asks whether candidates 'has been removed from the electoral list OR otherwise become legally ineligible' - the disjunctive 'or' is critical. Laurent Gbagbo's 2018 conviction resulted in a 20-year sentence and loss of civic rights, which multiple sources confirm keeps him struck from the electoral list as of late May 2025. This legal ineligibility clearly satisfies the resolution criteria. The evidence is robust: multiple independent sources (Le Point, tunisienumerique.com, Abidjan.net) confirm his disqualified status, and his own party's planned June evaluation acknowledges this current reality. The 32-day window until July 1 is very short for a reversal. While I maintain some caution about potential appeals, reporting errors, or unexpected political changes (hence not going above 90%), the preponderance of evidence supports a higher confidence level than my initial 85%. The other forecasters' reasoning about the strength of multiple source confirmation and the clear legal basis is sound.",
