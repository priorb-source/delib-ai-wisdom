    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core constraints I weighed: no invitation this late, lack of visible advance/security prep, and Canadian domestic political costs. Forecaster 2 adds the possibility of a strong US push; Forecaster 3 sharpens the time threshold (next 48–72 hours) for any upside movement. I find their reasoning sound and consistent with standard summit logistics and host-country politics. No materially new facts emerged, but the emphasis on how quickly the window closes (and the higher-than-usual security sensitivities given the Canada–India context) is persuasive at the margin.",
    "rationale": "The balance of evidence still points strongly to No: absence of an invitation with 12–14 days to go, outreach list seemingly already populated, and heightened security/political sensitivities that make a compressed lead time even less feasible. Even if a late invitation were issued, India might opt for sub-PM representation due to security and optics. Upside pathways exist (a late diplomatic push to signal a reset), but they require multiple things to break right very quickly. Given the other forecasters’ emphasis on the rapidly closing window and the domestic constraints on the Canadian side, I’m trimming slightly from 8% to 7%. I would move up only with credible reports of an invitation, Indian advance/security teams deploying, or official agenda updates listing India; I’d move down further if Canada publishes a final guest list without India or if no movement occurs by June 5–6.",
