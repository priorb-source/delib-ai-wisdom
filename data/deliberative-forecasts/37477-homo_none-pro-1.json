    "review": "The other forecasters provide a valuable spectrum of analysis. Forecaster 2, at 25%, compellingly argues for the 'No' case by emphasizing that tariffs are a 'core policy issue' for the administration, making their daily mention highly probable, especially with the strict dual-newspaper requirement. Forecaster 3, at 68%, offers the most useful structural insight by employing a clear quantitative model: `1 - (P_fail_daily ^ N_days)`. This approach clarifies that our primary disagreement is not on logic, but on the estimation of a single parameter: the daily probability of *both* papers omitting the word 'tariff(s)'. Forecaster 2's analysis implies this daily probability is very low (~1.25%), while Forecaster 3's is much higher (~5%).",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain my core reasoning but will refine my forecast slightly based on a more precise calculation. My initial forecast of 43% was based on the same implicit quantitative model that Forecaster 3 made explicit. The core of our disagreement lies in estimating the daily probability of a 'clean' day.\n\nForecaster 2's 25% forecast feels too low. It places immense weight on the 'status quo' and underrates the power of compounding even small probabilities over a 23-day window, which includes nine weekend or holiday days where economic news coverage typically lessens.\n\nForecaster 3's 68% forecast feels too high. A constant 5% daily probability of avoiding a mention in both the NYT and the business-focused WSJ seems optimistic. A core presidential policy is likely to be referenced frequently, even in passing, on one of the two front pages.\n\nMy position remains between these two views. I believe the daily probability of a 'clean' day is low, but not minuscule. In my original analysis, I estimated a 1% chance on weekdays and a 5% chance on weekends/holidays. Upon recounting, the 23-day period from May 9 to May 31 contains 14 weekdays and 9 weekend/holiday days (including Memorial Day). Recalculating with these figures gives a cumulative probability of `1 - ((0.99^14) * (0.95^9))`, which is approximately 45%. This deliberation has confirmed my initial approach was sound, as it synthesizes the 'high salience' argument from Forecaster 2 and the 'news cycle volatility' argument from Forecaster 3. The small update is a refinement of my own calculation, not a fundamental shift in my reasoning, which has been reinforced by the deliberation.",
