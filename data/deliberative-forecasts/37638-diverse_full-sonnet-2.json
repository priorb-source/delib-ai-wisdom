    "review": "Both forecasters make strong arguments that align with my core analysis, but Forecaster 3 raises a critical definitional issue I underweighted: whether SB 3 actually qualifies as a 'full ban' given it explicitly exempts the state's medical marijuana program. The resolution criteria require a law that 'fully prohibit[s] the sale of THC within the state' and explicitly state that partial bans will not count. SB 3, as described, would 'ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program' - meaning it maintains a medical exception. This carve-out could disqualify SB 3 from satisfying the resolution criteria even if it passes.\n\nForecaster 2's 15% seems too high given this definitional constraint plus the overwhelming evidence of House resistance and timeline constraints. However, I acknowledge the strength of their point about Lt. Gov. Patrick's political power and the possibility of unexpected last-minute deals.\n\nForecaster 3's 3% properly accounts for the definitional issue but may be slightly too confident given: (1) some interpretive ambiguity about whether a ban with a narrow medical exemption could still be considered 'full' for practical purposes; (2) the theoretical possibility of an even more extreme bill that eliminates medical exceptions entirely; (3) the small but non-zero chance of rapid special session dynamics we haven't fully considered.\n\nThe definitional constraint is the most important new consideration - it substantially narrows the already-slim paths to YES.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm updating my forecast downward for three key reasons. First, Forecaster 3's definitional analysis is compelling: if SB 3 preserves medical marijuana sales, it's arguably a partial ban that wouldn't satisfy the 'fully prohibit' requirement. This eliminates what I had considered the main (albeit unlikely) path to YES. Second, even setting aside the definitional issue, the combination of factors remains overwhelming: House opposition demonstrated through HB 46 (118-16 vote for expansion) and the amended SB 3 substitute version; only 12 days left in regular session; Governor Abbott's lack of stated interest in this issue; powerful economic ($8B industry), political (Ag Commissioner Miller), and public opinion (79% support medical marijuana) opposition. Third, for a true 'full ban' including medical marijuana to pass would require overcoming even steeper obstacles than SB 3 faces, as it would need to reverse the popular Compassionate Use Program expansion that just passed the House overwhelmingly.\n\nI'm not going as low as 3% because: (1) There remains interpretive uncertainty about whether a comprehensive ban on recreational/hemp THC that preserves only a narrow medical exemption might still qualify; (2) Lt. Gov. Patrick's power and determination create some possibility of surprising political pressure or deal-making; (3) A special session scenario, while unlikely given Abbott's apparent disinterest, cannot be completely ruled out before July 1.\n\nMy updated forecast reflects that the definitional constraint plus all the political obstacles make this outcome highly improbable, but not quite impossible given the remaining uncertainties.",
