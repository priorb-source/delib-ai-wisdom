    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable perspectives. Forecaster 2 (24%) emphasizes factors that could increase reporting: international flight routes, US carriers flying into South America, and continued UAP attention. However, these don't fundamentally change the historical base rate of 1-2 South American pilot reports annually to NUFORC. Seasonal factors like Starlink visibility occur year-round, not specifically in June. Forecaster 3 (5%) correctly emphasizes the extreme specificity of the combined criteria and the rarity of such reports. However, 5% may underweight the documented precedents (Brazil Dec 2024, Chilean Air Force Feb 2023) that confirm such reports do occur with measurable regularity. Both forecasters agree with my base rate assessment of ~1-2 reports per year, which translates to roughly 8-17% monthly probability. Forecaster 2's double weighting seems insufficiently justified by the evidence presented, while Forecaster 3's more conservative stance has merit but may be overly pessimistic given the historical occurrence rate.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my original 12% forecast remains well-grounded in the mathematical base rate. Using 1-2 annual reports yields a monthly expectation of 0.08-0.17 events. A Poisson distribution with λ=0.125 gives P(X≥1)≈12%, which directly reflects the data. Forecaster 3's concern about the extreme specificity of four combined criteria is valid and warrants slight downward adjustment. The criteria require: (1) pilot report, (2) South America, (3) June specifically, and (4) NUFORC posting. Each additional constraint reduces probability. However, dropping to 5% would ignore that we have recent documented cases proving feasibility. Forecaster 2's optimism about international routes is interesting but doesn't override the fundamental constraint that South American pilots rarely use NUFORC's English-language US-based system. I'm adjusting slightly downward to 10% to acknowledge the compounding effect of multiple specific criteria while maintaining fidelity to the historical base rate.",
