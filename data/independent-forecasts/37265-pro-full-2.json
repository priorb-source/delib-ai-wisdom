  "information": "As of May 2, 2025, Tanzania holds a Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution travel advisory from the US State Department, last updated on September 9, 2024. The advisory cites crime, terrorism, and the targeting of LGBTQI+ persons as primary concerns. While the country is at Level 2 overall, specific regions such as Mtwara have a higher, Level 3 warning. In March 2025, the US Embassy issued an alert regarding coastal security.\n\nSeveral other countries in the region or with similar risk profiles have recently been elevated to Level 3. Uganda's advisory was raised due to terrorism risks, political demonstrations, and discriminatory laws. Burundi's Level 3 advisory cites violent crimes like grenade attacks and armed robbery targeting foreigners. The State Department also reissued a Level 3 alert for Bangladesh due to civil unrest, crime, and terrorism, and issued a Level 3 warning for Trinidad and Tobago following a surge in violent crime and a declared state of emergency.\n\nThe US State Department's travel advisory system consists of four tiers: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). Advisories are regularly reviewed and can be upgraded due to factors like a significant deterioration in security, increased terrorist activity, political instability, or civil unrest. A notable security concern for Tanzania is the insurgency in Mozambique's Niassa Reserve, which borders the country. Terrorist activity linked to Islamic extremism was reported in the area as recently as April 2025, creating potential spillover risks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The US State Department travel advisory for Tanzania will remain at Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security situation in Tanzania remains stable. While concerns about crime, terrorism, and LGBTQI+ targeting persist, there are no major incidents, terrorist attacks, or significant escalations in unrest that would prompt the State Department to issue a country-wide Level 3 advisory. The insurgency in Mozambique continues to be largely contained at the border.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant event occurs that deteriorates the security situation. This could be a large-scale terrorist attack targeting foreigners in a major city like Dar es Salaam or a popular tourist area like Zanzibar. Alternatively, there could be a substantial spillover of the insurgency from Mozambique into southern Tanzania, or a sudden political crisis leading to widespread civil unrest and violence.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant inertia of State Department travel advisories and the short timeframe remaining until the resolution date. The status quo is that Tanzania is at Level 2, and this is the most likely outcome. While the research highlights several real and concerning risk factors—namely crime, terrorism threats (especially spillover from Mozambique), and the targeting of LGBTQI+ persons—these are already cited in the current Level 2 advisory. For an upgrade to Level 3, there would likely need to be a qualitative shift or a major triggering event that makes the country significantly more dangerous for US citizens, rather than a continuation of existing threats. The State Department's current approach of assigning a higher Level 3 warning to specific regions like Mtwara, rather than the entire country, suggests they prefer a targeted approach, which makes a blanket upgrade less probable unless the threat becomes widespread. The advisory was last updated in September 2024, and while a coastal security alert was issued in March 2025, it hasn't yet been deemed sufficient to raise the overall level. The comparison to neighboring Uganda and Burundi, which are at Level 3, indicates that the State Department is willing to make such changes, but it also implies that the current situation in Tanzania has not yet met their threshold for that level. Why my forecast is not lower: The risks are legitimate, particularly the insurgency on the Mozambique border which saw activity as recently as April 2025. A single significant incident could rapidly change the assessment, so the probability is not trivial. Why my forecast is not higher: The timeframe is very short (less than two months). It is statistically unlikely that a major, advisory-changing event will occur in this specific window. The status quo is a powerful predictor over short periods. I would increase my forecast if there were a confirmed major attack on a tourist hub or a significant, violent escalation of the Mozambique conflict into Tanzania. I would decrease it as the July 1 deadline approaches without any such incidents.",
