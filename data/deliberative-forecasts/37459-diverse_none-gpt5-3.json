    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a useful nuance: the historical Buffett–Gates optics constraint on Microsoft is now largely moot, which modestly increases MSFT’s plausibility relative to my prior framing. Forecaster 3’s point about the absence of leaks for a large, high‑profile position is also persuasive and pushes the odds down for any sizable initiation. Both remain consistent with a low base rate, and neither provides concrete evidence of a purchase. Net, these arguments largely offset: MSFT is a bit more plausible than I allowed, but the leak/visibility argument reinforces the status‑quo No outcome.",
    "rationale": "We’re days from the 13F deadline, and there are no credible signals that Berkshire initiated Alphabet/Meta/Microsoft/Nvidia/Tesla in Q1. Berkshire has been net a seller with record cash, consistent with caution at elevated valuations. Confidential treatment would also resolve as No for this specific filing. Among candidates, Alphabet and Microsoft are the most plausible: durable moats, strong cash generation, and (for Microsoft) the prior optics constraint has faded. Nvidia and Tesla remain very unlikely given valuation/risk profile and past commentary; Meta is possible but less aligned with Berkshire’s preference to avoid platform/regulatory unpredictability at rich multiples. Deputy‑led, small positions are the primary path to Yes, but the base rate of surprise M7 initiations is very low, and the lack of market chatter lowers the odds of a meaningful stake. Balancing a slightly higher MSFT plausibility against the leak argument and Berkshire’s continued conservatism, I keep my estimate unchanged.",
