    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental dynamics of this question. We all identified the same core tension: the powerful institutional momentum from the NFL Commissioner and league office pushing for a ban versus the high procedural hurdle of a 24-vote supermajority. Both forecasters correctly highlighted the strategic reframing of the proposal from a narrow 'Tush-Push' ban to a broader rule against pushing any ball carrier. \n\nForecaster 2, in particular, raised two excellent points that I had not fully weighted. First, they noted that a broader rule could have 'unintended consequences' for other types of plays, which could make some owners hesitant and complicate the effort to gain the final 8 votes. This is a crucial counterpoint to the idea that reframing the rule is a purely positive strategic move. Second, they astutely pointed out the NFL's history of making rule changes based on aesthetics (the 'looks like rugby' argument) rather than just proven safety data. This adds support to the idea that the league's motivation is strong enough to overcome the lack of injury evidence. These analyses were highly convincing and provided valuable nuance.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 70% to 65%. While my initial reasoning remains intact, the deliberation highlighted a key risk I had underestimated. Forecaster 2's point about the 'unintended consequences' of a broader rule is particularly compelling. While reframing the proposal is a shrewd tactic to avoid singling out one team, it also introduces new variables. Owners who might have supported a narrow ban could be reluctant to vote for a sweeping rule that might be difficult to officiate or negatively affect other common football plays. This added complexity makes securing the 8 additional votes needed for a supermajority more challenging than I first assessed. The other forecasters' consensus at 65% also suggests I may have been slightly overconfident in the league's ability to whip votes on a new proposal in such a short timeframe. I still believe the immense pressure from the Commissioner makes a ban the most likely outcome, but I am adjusting my probability to better reflect the increased uncertainty introduced by the new, broader proposal.",
