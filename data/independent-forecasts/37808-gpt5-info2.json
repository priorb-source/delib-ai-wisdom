  "information": "The Diversity Visa program was established by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Trump administration, which began in January 2025, has previously expressed opposition to the program. The administration issued executive orders in January 2025 concerning Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) related websites across federal agencies. In April 2025, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives with the goal of terminating the statutory DV program.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (≈42 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the DV “Step 1: Submit an Entry” page remains online at the specified URL with registration instructions, as it typically does year-round.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Congress passes and the President signs a DV-repeal bill before July 1, and State rapidly removes or replaces the Submit an Entry page (or it 404s/redirects such that the instructions are no longer at that URL). Alternatively, an agency-wide directive specifically targeting DV content leads State to take the page down or relocate it before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "No repeal is enacted before July 1 and State keeps the DV content unchanged; the page continues to display instructions (even if noting the entry period is closed until October), accessible at the same URL.",
    "rationale": "- Timeframe and inertia: With ~6 weeks to go, large policy changes that cascade into web removals are less likely. Government sites, especially statutory program pages, tend to be stable quarter-to-quarter.\n- Statutory anchor: The Diversity Visa program is established in law. Ending it requires Congress. Even if the administration opposes DV, State typically maintains statutory program pages until a legal change occurs. This has been true historically, including during the 2017–2020 Trump term when DV pages remained online despite opposition.\n- Legislative risk window: Your assistant notes a House bill (April 2025) to terminate DV. For a No by July 1, the bill would need to pass both chambers, be signed, and State would need to act on the website quickly. That sequence is possible but tight on this timeline. Even with unified control, major immigration changes often take longer than 6 weeks to clear Congress and be implemented.\n- DEI website order: The January 2025 orders reportedly concerned DEI content. The DV program is not a DEI initiative; it is a visa category established by statute. That order is a weak signal for near-term removal of DV content.\n- Site-change risk: A smaller risk is State restructuring travel.state.gov and moving/renaming the page. Because the resolution requires the instructions to be at the exact URL, a 404 or a redirect to a different path could produce a No. However, mid-year IA overhauls are infrequent, and State often preserves legacy paths or uses redirects to the same content (which may or may not satisfy the resolver, but the prompt suggests the content must be at that location).\nWhy not higher: Non-trivial risk (~15–20%) from (a) accelerated legislative repeal plus rapid web update, or (b) a targeted directive from State/OMB to remove DV registration instructions, or (c) a site restructure/URL change that breaks the exact-path condition.\nWhy not lower: The status quo is strong. The program is still operating, the entry period typically opens in October, and the page historically remains online year-round with instructions. There is little time for a full repeal-and-implementation cycle before July 1, and prior administrations opposing DV did not remove these pages in the short run.\nUpdates that would move me lower: Senate leadership fast-tracks the DV repeal bill; credible reports that the repeal will be effective immediately; State or OMB guidance to remove DV content; travel.state.gov announces a near-term IA overhaul affecting DV URLs.\nUpdates that would move me higher: Public indications that the Senate will not take up the bill before August; statements from State affirming DV-2027 timeline; signs that the website structure will remain stable through summer.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US State Department's Diversity Visa page still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | [Donald Trump's 2017 tweet discussing the DV program](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925684982307348480)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Step 1 Submit an Entry page with instructions for registering for the Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) Program is at [this location](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html) when attempted to be accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Diversity Visa program was established by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Trump administration, which began in January 2025, has previously expressed opposition to the program. The administration issued executive orders in January 2025 concerning Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) related websites across federal agencies. In April 2025, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives with the goal of terminating the statutory DV program.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
