  "information": "A high-level international conference on the two-state solution is scheduled for June 17-20, 2025, at the UN headquarters in New York. The conference is co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia and is based on a UN General Assembly resolution from December 2024. Its stated aim is to generate momentum for more countries to recognize a Palestinian state. Supporting this effort, the Arab Group at the UN has urged member countries to recognize Palestine as a step toward lasting peace. Additionally, the 'Madrid+' group, comprising Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, and Norway, has called for Palestine's full UN membership, describing it as a \"political and diplomatic necessity.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (from June 1 to June 30, 2025; resolves by July 1)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new recognitions in June 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The June 17–20 UN conference yields statements but no concrete recognitions. France continues to link recognition to specific conditions/timing, the UK stays on hold due to pre‑election ‘purdah,’ EU coordination norms nudge Belgium/Luxembourg/Malta/Portugal to wait, and non‑EU holdouts (Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea) refrain. June ends without any government announcing recognition.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "One or more governments time an announcement to the UN conference. Most plausibly: France recognizes during or immediately after the meeting, or a smaller EU state (e.g., Malta, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal) moves—potentially in a small group—citing the conference and Arab Group appeal. Less likely but possible: a non‑EU swing state (e.g., Australia) surprises with a unilateral announcement.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/state of play: Roughly 145–150 UN members already recognize Palestine; remaining holdouts are concentrated in Western Europe (France, UK, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Portugal, etc.), North America (US, Canada), Oceania (Australia, NZ, several Pacific states), Japan/South Korea, and a few others. Many of these are cautious and coordinate decisions, so the default in any given month is “no change.”\n- Near-term catalysts: A high-level conference on the two-state solution (June 17–20, NYC), co‑chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, is explicitly designed to generate momentum for recognition. The Arab Group at the UN has urged member states to recognize Palestine. The Madrid+ group (Spain, Ireland, Slovenia, Norway—already recognizers) is pushing for Palestine’s full UN membership. The UK has joined France’s initiative on recognition sequencing/conditions, signaling elevated diplomacy.\n- Key constraints tempering the upside: \n  - UK is entering a July 4 election; pre‑election caretaker rules make a June recognition very unlikely.\n  - France has been cautious, emphasizing “useful timing/conditions” for recognition; it may prefer to build a broader package (ceasefire/prisoner deal, governance/PA reforms) before moving. Paris could decide in June but has strong incentives to stage-manage timing, and it may prefer a coordinated EU move that isn’t yet ready.\n  - Other EU holdouts (Belgium, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Italy, Germany) tend to coordinate and several have domestic/coalition constraints; many may wait for France or broader EU consensus. Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Nordics (except Sweden) look especially unlikely in June.\n  - Non‑EU holdouts like Australia, Canada, Japan, South Korea are historically cautious and unlikely to time a recognition to a UN conference without allied alignment.\n- Why not lower: The explicit goal of the June conference is to spur recognitions, and France’s leadership increases the chance someone times an announcement for maximum diplomatic impact. Even if Paris holds, a smaller EU country could seize the moment.\n- Why not higher: The biggest plausible mover (France) still looks more 50/50 at best on June timing, and many other potential recognizers have reasons to wait (UK election timing, EU coordination, US pressure, desire to link recognition to concrete steps on the ground). The status quo in most months is “no new recognitions,” so base rates pull the forecast down.\n- What would push me up: Reliable reporting that France will recognize in June; leaks of a planned joint EU mini‑bloc recognition (e.g., France plus Malta/Belgium/Luxembourg/Portugal) tied to the conference; concrete language in the conference agenda/communiqué foreshadowing imminent recognitions.\n- What would push me down: Signals from Paris that recognition will wait for post‑conference processes or for UK’s new government; public walk-backs from likely small-EU candidates; deterioration in Gaza diplomacy that makes Western recognitions less likely in June.\n- Research assistant inputs used: The June 17–20 conference co‑chaired by France/Saudi Arabia aimed at catalyzing recognitions; Arab Group urging recognitions; Madrid+ pushing UN membership; UK joining France’s initiative. These raise the short-term hazard above baseline but don’t overcome the identified constraints.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a UN member country newly recognize Palestine in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[UK joins France's initiative for recognition of Palestinian state](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/05/20/uk-joins-france-s-initiative-for-recognition-of-palestinian-state_6741456_4.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, a UN member country announces that it recognizes Palestine as a sovereign nation. Resolves based on Al Jazeera's [tracking page](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/10/mapping-which-countries-recognise-palestine-in-2025) or other credible sources should the tracking page not be timely updated.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA high-level international conference on the two-state solution is scheduled for June 17-20, 2025, at the UN headquarters in New York.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
