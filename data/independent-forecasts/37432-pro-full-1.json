  "information": "In Ohio, Republican lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 153 (SB 153), which would create new requirements for citizen-led ballot initiatives. The bill would compel paid signature gatherers to wear visible badges, list employers on petitions, and maintain detailed records. The bill's definition of 'paid' circulators is considered broad, and it requires petition signers to be registered voters on the exact day they sign. As of early May 2025, this bill had not completed the legislative process. In February 2025, a provision requiring Ohioans to prove citizenship to register to vote at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles was removed from the state's transportation budget by Republicans. Instead, BMV employees will be prohibited from offering registration forms to individuals identified as non-citizens. This change was prompted by a report from Secretary of State Frank LaRose indicating that non-citizens were accidentally registering to vote, partly due to language barriers.\n\nThe Ohio legislature has Republican supermajorities in both the Senate (26-7) and the House (67-32). Senators Theresa Gavarone and Andrew Brenner are key sponsors pushing for stricter election laws. In early 2023, Governor Mike DeWine signed HB 458, a voter ID law. However, Governor DeWine has also expressed some hesitation regarding the current proof-of-citizenship proposals. Organizations such as the ACLU are actively opposing the new legislation. The Ohio General Assembly has session days scheduled through late June 2025, ahead of the July 1, 2025 resolution deadline.\n\nThere is a national trend of Republican-led efforts to enact proof-of-citizenship voting requirements. At the federal level, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration. Several states have pursued similar legislation. Wyoming passed a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote, which will take effect on July 1, 2025. In Iowa, a state audit found 277 noncitizens were registered to vote or had voted in the 2024 election. In Tennessee, a bill to create a portal for election workers to verify voter citizenship has advanced in the state House. In Michigan, a proposed constitutional amendment that would have required proof of citizenship for voter registration failed to pass.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Slightly less than two months, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new legislation expanding voter citizenship verification requirements is enacted by the deadline, and Ohio's existing laws remain in place.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite having a supermajority, Republican legislators remain divided on the necessity and specific language of the bill. Key committee members, potentially influenced by Governor DeWine's hesitance and the recent removal of a similar provision from the transportation budget, delay action. The legislature runs out of time in its session, which ends in late June, and fails to pass an identical bill in both chambers before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Spurred by a national push for similar 'election integrity' laws and a targeted campaign by the bill's sponsors, Republican leadership fast-tracks a proof-of-citizenship bill in the final weeks of the session. They successfully whip the votes needed to overcome internal dissent, passing an identical version through both the House and Senate before the end of June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on several key factors, with the status quo being the most likely outcome. While Ohio's legislature has strong Republican supermajorities in both chambers and there is a national trend of Republican-led states pursuing such legislation, recent events within Ohio strongly suggest this specific bill will not pass before the deadline. The most significant piece of evidence is the fact that in February 2025, Republican lawmakers themselves removed a provision requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote from the state's transportation budget. This action indicates a lack of consensus and significant internal division on this issue, even within the majority party. Governor DeWine's noted hesitation, while not a direct veto threat on enactment (which occurs upon passage in both chambers), signals a lack of top-down pressure to pass the bill. With less than two months until the deadline, the legislative calendar is tight, and overcoming this demonstrated internal inertia and division is a high bar. The arguments for 'Yes'—the supermajority and the national political climate—make passage possible, but the specific, recent, and local evidence of opposition from within the majority party is more compelling. My probability is not lower because a supermajority still provides a viable, if narrow, path to passage should leadership decide to prioritize it in the final weeks. My probability is not higher because this would ignore the powerful signal sent when the party proactively stripped a similar measure from a recent major bill.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Ohio, Republican lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 153 (SB 153), which would create new requirements for citizen-led ballot initiatives.
