  "information": "Under Ukrainian law, specifically Article 19 of the Law “On the Legal Regime of Martial Law,” scheduling or holding national elections is forbidden while martial law is in effect. On May 15, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine's parliament) voted to prolong martial law and general mobilization until at least August 6, 2025. The parliamentary rules of procedure also stipulate that once martial law is lifted, the date for the next presidential election must be set no less than 90 days in advance.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelensky's office officially denied media reports suggesting that presidential elections were being planned for July 2025. Sources within the president's office and the Ukrainian government told BBC News Ukraine that no meetings had been held nor instructions given to prepare for elections, labeling the reports as 'fake or manipulative information.' President Zelensky has repeatedly stated that the question of holding elections can only be considered after the conflict is resolved.\n\nFormer President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced on February 16, 2025, that the next presidential elections will take place on October 26, 2025. He claimed his information came from multiple sources, including the Office of the President, law enforcement agencies, the Central Election Commission, and a printing plant which, he alleged, was already calculating the number of ballots required. This followed earlier reports in March 2025 from The Economist, which, citing anonymous sources in the Ukrainian government, had suggested President Zelensky was planning to announce a surprise election for July 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one and a half months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Martial law is currently in effect and has been extended beyond the resolution date, and Ukrainian law prohibits the announcement or holding of elections during this period.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The war continues, and martial law remains in effect past July 1, 2025, as recently extended by the Verkhovna Rada. The Ukrainian government maintains its official position that elections cannot be considered until after the conflict, and no official announcement of an election date is made.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and dramatic development, such as a major battlefield success or an unexpected ceasefire agreement, leads to the lifting of martial law. Alternatively, facing immense internal or external political pressure, President Zelensky's government pushes for a change in the law to allow for an election announcement, and an official date is set before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily favors a 'No' outcome, primarily due to the strong legal and political barriers in place. The most significant piece of evidence is that Ukrainian law explicitly forbids scheduling elections while martial law is active. On May 15, 2025, the Verkhovna Rada took the concrete step of extending martial law until August 6, 2025, which is more than a month after this question's resolution date. This legislative action, combined with repeated official statements from President Zelensky and his office denying any plans for an election, establishes a very strong status quo. The claims from former President Poroshenko and anonymous sources reported by The Economist are the primary evidence for a 'Yes' vote, but these are weak signals. Poroshenko is a political opponent, and his claims could be a strategic maneuver to apply pressure. Anonymous reports are inherently less reliable than official, on-the-record denials and legislative acts. For an election to be announced, the law would have to be changed, and martial law would likely need to be lifted—two major political events that are highly improbable in the next six weeks given the recent extension. My probability is not lower than 2% because there is a small, non-zero chance of a 'black swan' event, such as a sudden end to hostilities or a major political realignment that makes the seemingly impossible happen. My probability is not higher because the official, legal, and recently confirmed evidence overwhelmingly points against an announcement. I would increase my forecast if there were official moves to amend the law on elections during martial law or if a credible peace process were to begin. I would decrease it if the conflict were to intensify further.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine announce a presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Next Ukrainian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_presidential_election)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
