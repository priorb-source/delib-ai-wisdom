  "information": "In April 2025, the Ministry of Tourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) warned tourism stakeholders against promoting or facilitating the use of illegal taxis, with businesses facing a $1000 fine for such referrals. The government has emphasized that operating an unlicensed taxi is a serious offense, with penalties for drivers including a fine and disqualification from driving. The country, with a resident population of approximately 45,000, has also implemented a new \"Rate Your Ride\" framework. As of May 2025, two locally-based ride-hailing services are confirmed to be operating: GetMe Ride, which launched in 2019, and Conch Cab, which began service in May 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Uber is not currently available in Turks and Caicos Islands",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Uber continues not operating in TCI due to the extremely small market size (45,000 residents), presence of established local competitors (GetMe Ride and Conch Cab), and insufficient time to complete regulatory approval, driver recruitment, and operational setup within 2 months",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Uber announces an immediate expansion into TCI, rapidly navigates the local regulatory framework emphasizing licensed operations, recruits and onboards drivers, and launches service by July 1st - possibly seeing the tourism market as strategically valuable despite small resident population",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Turks and Caicos has only 45,000 residents, making it an extremely small market by Uber's typical standards - smaller than many individual neighborhoods in cities where Uber operates. Two months is an insufficient timeframe for Uber to make a strategic decision, navigate regulations (especially given the government's recent crackdown on illegal taxis), establish operations, and recruit drivers. The market already has two ride-hailing services: GetMe Ride (operating since 2019) and Conch Cab (just launched May 2025), indicating local competition is serving the market. Most critically, there is zero evidence of Uber planning to enter this market - no announcements, job postings, or regulatory filings. Uber typically announces new market launches well in advance. The only factor favoring Yes is the tourism market, which could supplement the small resident population, but this is insufficient to overcome the substantial barriers. My forecast is not higher because of the overwhelming evidence against expansion: tiny market size, short timeframe, existing competition, and no signals of Uber's interest. My forecast is not lower (not closer to 0-1%) only because unexpected corporate decisions can occasionally happen, and I maintain epistemic humility about low-probability events. To update higher, I would need: concrete evidence of Uber's expansion plans, regulatory applications filed, or driver recruitment in TCI. To update lower: explicit statements from Uber about market priorities excluding small island markets, or additional TCI regulatory barriers.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Uber be available in the Turks and Caicos Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tourism Stakeholders Warned About Encouraging Use of Illegal Taxis](https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/tourism-stakeholders-warned-about-encouraging-use-of-illegal-taxis/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Uber is available in Turks and Caicos as shown on the [Uber website](https://www.uber.com/us/en/search-results/?query=TURKS+AND+CAICOS) or according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn April 2025, the Ministry of Tourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) warned tourism stakeholders against promoting or facilitating the use of illegal taxis, with businesses facing a $1000 fine for such referrals.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
