    "review": "All three forecasters independently arrived at the same 2% forecast, which provides strong validation of this assessment. The other forecasters raised some valuable specific points I should highlight: (1) Forecaster 2 explicitly quantified that even at much higher burn rates of $10-15 million quarterly (vs. the actual $3M in Q4), ChargePoint would still have years of runway - this is a useful concrete calculation that reinforces the financial strength; (2) Forecaster 2 made an excellent point that 57 days is insufficient time for most bankruptcy preparations even if a company wanted to file, adding another structural barrier; (3) Both forecasters noted that companies in far worse financial condition often operate for months or years before filing, providing helpful context on base rates. Their reasoning is thorough, evidence-based, and arrives at the same conclusion through similar analytical paths. The consensus on key factors is striking: strong cash position, dramatically improved burn rate, no near-term debt, recent positive funding news, and the distinction between stock price compliance issues and actual liquidity crises. No forecaster presented new information or arguments that would warrant changing my assessment in either direction.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find their reasoning completely aligned with and reinforcing of my initial assessment. The independent convergence on 2% across three forecasters strengthens my confidence that this forecast appropriately captures the situation. The financial fundamentals remain overwhelmingly positive for avoiding bankruptcy in the next 57 days: $225.6M cash with only $3M quarterly burn provides massive runway, no debt maturities create pressure, and the company just secured additional funding days ago. The 2% appropriately reflects that while bankruptcy is extremely unlikely given these strong fundamentals and short timeframe, we cannot assign zero probability to unforeseen catastrophic events (fraud, massive undisclosed liabilities, complete operational collapse). The consensus provides no reason to update higher - the financial data simply doesn't support higher bankruptcy risk. I also don't see reason to update lower - the 2% already captures appropriate epistemic humility about black swan events while being anchored in the strong objective data. If anything, the additional quantitative context from other forecasters about runway even at higher burn rates reinforces that 2% may even be slightly generous to the upside risk.",
