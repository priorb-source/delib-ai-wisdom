    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize CDC precedent: yellow fever outbreaks (e.g., Brazil 2016–18, Nigeria 2019) remained at Level 2 because vaccination and bite precautions substantially mitigate traveler risk. They add useful specifics I hadn’t cited: indications of rural concentration (e.g., Tolima, Putumayo), lack of verified urban transmission in major cities, regional case totals that are not explosive, and the observation that CDC Travel Health Notices are fairly sticky over short horizons. One notes a recent (April 2025) CDC Level 2 regional alert, which further lowers near‑term upgrade odds. Their identified upgrade triggers (sustained urban transmission, vaccine access failures, sharp surges, CDC HANs/WHO escalations) align with mine. I find their reasoning consistent with CDC practice and the short timeline; nothing presented suggests imminent conditions that would meet CDC’s usual bar for a Level 3 countrywide notice for yellow fever.",
    "rationale": "The question resolves Yes only if Colombia’s notice exceeds Level 2 (i.e., Level 3+) on or after June 1. CDC rarely issues Level 3 for yellow fever because traveler risk is highly mitigable with vaccination and standard precautions. Despite Colombia’s emergency declaration and broad municipal risk mapping, current evidence points to primarily sylvatic transmission without sustained urban cycles in major hubs, and reported case counts are modest relative to past regional outbreaks that remained at Level 2. With ~5–6 weeks to go and policy inertia in CDC notices, the base case is that Level 2 persists. A non‑trivial tail remains: if rapid urban transmission emerges in a major city/tourist area, if vaccine availability/access for travelers degrades, or if there’s a marked surge prompting WHO/PAHO and CDC HAN escalations, an upgrade could occur. Seasonal vector conditions could raise incidence, but it would likely take unusually severe and clearly less‑mitigable risk to trigger a Level 3 nationwide notice in this short window. I therefore trim my prior 9% slightly to reflect the added precedent and timeline arguments.",
