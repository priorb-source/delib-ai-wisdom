    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Han Duck-soo has not announced his candidacy as of April 22, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Han Duck-soo decides to remain as Acting President without entering the presidential race, either because he determines that running would be politically unwise given his caretaker role, or he faces insufficient party consensus despite growing support. He may also decide to delay any announcement beyond May 5th, or ultimately choose not to run at all.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The growing support within the PPP reaches a critical mass over the next 13 days, and Han Duck-soo is persuaded to enter the race. Given the June election timeline, he makes a formal announcement of his candidacy between now and May 5th to allow sufficient time for campaigning. The pressure from party members who see him as a viable candidate overcomes any hesitation about his Acting President status.",
    "rationale": "With only 13 days remaining until the resolution date, the status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome since Han has not yet announced his candidacy. The Korea Herald article indicates support is 'growing' rather than describing imminent plans or concrete preparations for an announcement, suggesting this is still in the discussion phase rather than execution phase. As Acting President, Han faces unique political constraints that complicate a candidacy announcement. For a June 2025 election, most serious candidates would already be actively campaigning by late April, yet we only hear of draft efforts rather than campaign preparations. The probability is not near zero because political announcements can happen quickly, there is documented support for his candidacy, and 13 days provides adequate time for an announcement. However, the probability cannot be high because: (1) strong status quo bias favors no change, (2) we would expect more concrete signals by now if an announcement were imminent, (3) his Acting President role creates complications, and (4) the article describes growing support rather than finalized plans. To update higher, I would need evidence of: active campaign preparation, statements from Han suggesting interest, or insider reports of imminent announcement. To update lower, I would need Han or his associates explicitly ruling out a run.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Han Duck-soo announce his candidacy for South Korean president before May 5, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Chosun Daily: [Support grows in PPP to draft Acting President Han for June election](https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10464554)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Han Duck-soo announces his candidacy for president of South Korea before May 5, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
