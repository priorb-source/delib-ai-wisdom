  "information": "The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's deportation was unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to 'facilitate' his return. Subsequently, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ordered the administration to explain its diplomatic efforts with El Salvador regarding his return and set deadlines for the government to provide information and documents. An earlier court-ordered deadline for Garcia's return of April 7, 2025, passed without compliance.\n\nThe Trump administration has publicly resisted the court orders. President Trump stated the case is 'in the hands of lawyers' but also claimed he 'could' have Garcia returned with a single phone call but would not, citing alleged MS-13 gang affiliations. The Department of Homeland Security acknowledged the initial deportation was an 'administrative mistake'. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that if Garcia were to return to the U.S., he would be immediately deported again.\n\nKilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador around March 15, 2025, and is being held in a maximum-security prison. The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, has publicly labeled Garcia a 'terrorist' and has stated that he will not be released or returned to the United States. U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to demand Garcia's release from prison, but reported that the U.S. embassy in El Salvador had not received instructions to assist in the matter.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US executive branch continues to resist or delay acting on the court orders, and the government of El Salvador continues to refuse to release Kilmar Abrego Garcia from prison. The legal and diplomatic stalemate persists, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes with Garcia still in El Salvador.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing escalating legal consequences, such as contempt of court rulings against senior officials, the Trump administration applies significant diplomatic pressure on El Salvador. A breakthrough is achieved, possibly as part of a broader diplomatic deal, securing Garcia's release from prison and his transport to the United States just before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant and multi-faceted opposition to Mr. Garcia's return, weighed against the legal mandate to do so. The status quo is a powerful indicator; a court-ordered deadline of April 7 has already passed without compliance, demonstrating the current stalemate is entrenched. The primary obstacles are the stated positions of two heads of state: President Trump has publicly resisted the court order, and President Bukele of El Salvador, who has physical custody of Mr. Garcia in a maximum-security prison, has unequivocally stated Garcia will not be released or returned. Overcoming the intransigence of a foreign government that has physical custody of an individual is a monumental diplomatic task, especially within a two-month timeframe and without the full commitment of the U.S. executive branch. While the unanimous Supreme Court ruling provides a powerful legal basis for his return, and judicial and political pressure from figures like Senator Van Hollen continues, these forces have so far been insufficient to overcome the executive resistance in both nations. The probability is not zero because the U.S. judiciary could escalate pressure significantly, potentially through contempt of court proceedings that force the administration's hand, or an unforeseen diplomatic development could occur. The probability is not higher because the path to 'Yes' requires not just a change of heart from the U.S. administration but also compelling a foreign president to reverse a publicly stated, hardline position, all within a very short period. I would increase my forecast upon seeing evidence of active, high-level diplomatic engagement by the U.S. State Department or any softening of President Bukele's stance. Conversely, I would lower it if another month passes with no progress.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
