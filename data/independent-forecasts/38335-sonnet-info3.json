  "information": "Casey DeSantis is facing public scrutiny related to a House probe into the Hope Florida foundation, an initiative she launched. The investigation was reported by multiple news outlets in late May and early June 2025. The next major campaign finance deadline is June 30, which marks the end of the second fundraising quarter. Historically, major candidates for Florida governor typically announce their campaigns between 8 and 18 months prior to the primary election, which is scheduled for August 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Casey DeSantis has not announced her candidacy as of June 5, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis delays her announcement beyond July 1, either to let the House probe into Hope Florida foundation conclude, to assess the political landscape given Byron Donalds' surge with Trump's endorsement, or because she decides not to run at all. She may wait until later in the summer or fall to announce if she runs.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis announces her candidacy in the next 26 days, possibly timing it with the June 30 campaign finance deadline to generate momentum. She might use a campaign announcement to pivot away from the negative attention surrounding the Hope Florida probe and try to establish herself before Byron Donalds formally enters the race.",
    "rationale": "With only 26 days until the resolution date, the status quo heavily favors No. While the timing is within the typical 8-18 month announcement window before the August 2026 primary (we're 14 months out), several factors make an imminent announcement unlikely. First, Casey DeSantis is currently facing scrutiny from a House probe into Hope Florida - politicians typically avoid major announcements during active investigations to prevent the scandal from dominating the launch narrative. Second, polling shows Byron Donalds surging ahead with Trump's backing, which may cause her to reassess timing or viability. Third, there are no reported signals of an imminent announcement (no staff hires, exploratory committees, or media teases mentioned). The June 30 campaign finance deadline provides a natural timing point that could trigger an announcement, which prevents me from going lower than 20%. However, the combination of scandal timing, competitive disadvantage, short timeframe, and absence of announcement signals makes a late June announcement improbable. For me to update upward, I'd need reports of campaign infrastructure being assembled or scheduled announcements. To update downward, I'd need explicit statements ruling out a run or Byron Donalds formally announcing.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
