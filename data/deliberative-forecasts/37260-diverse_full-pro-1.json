    "review": "There is a strong consensus among all three forecasters. We all independently identified the same insurmountable barriers to a 'Yes' outcome: 1) Procedural: No formal application has been filed with the Federal Constitutional Court, which is a mandatory first step. 2) Temporal: The less than two-month timeframe is entirely insufficient for a legal process that historically takes years. 3) Political: The initial motion in the Bundestag lacked majority support, and banning a party with 25-26% popular support is politically explosive and unlikely. 4) Historical: The base rate of party bans in post-war Germany is extremely low. Forecaster 3's explicit mention of Article 21 of the Basic Law and their structured list of update conditions were particularly helpful in reinforcing the legal and analytical framework. The minor difference between a 1% and 2% forecast reflects a slight variance in estimating an extreme tail risk, not a fundamental disagreement on the core analysis. The arguments presented by the other forecasters strongly validate my initial reasoning.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from my fellow forecasters, my conviction in my initial assessment has been strengthened. The deliberation confirms that the probability of the AfD being banned by July 1, 2025, is exceedingly low. The reasoning from all participants is aligned on the key constraints. Most critically, the legal process has not even commenced, as no formal application has been filed with the Federal Constitutional Court. With less than two months remaining until the deadline, the timeline makes a resolution impossible. Based on historical precedent, such as the failed NPD ban case, these proceedings take years to conclude, not weeks. Additionally, there is no evidence of the necessary political consensus; the January 2025 motion to begin the process lacked majority support in the Bundestag. The political calculus of banning a party polling at 25-26% makes such a move highly improbable. The arguments presented by the other forecasters have not introduced any new information to suggest these fundamental barriers can be overcome in the given timeframe. Therefore, I see no reason to alter my initial forecast.",
