    "review": "My initial forecast and that of Forecaster 2 were aligned at 35%, while Forecaster 3 was more pessimistic at 25%. All three of us correctly identified the central tension: the current positive momentum (an active IMF mission, a specific deal on the table, significant external pressure from the EU) versus the substantial and historically entrenched obstacles (political gridlock, the contentious nature of the bank-restructuring law). The core difference in our final probabilities comes down to the weight assigned to each side of this equation. I found Forecaster 3's reasoning particularly convincing in two respects. First, they effectively framed the one-month timeline as exceptionally short for passing such complex and divisive legislation in *any* political system, let alone Lebanon's. Second, their interpretation of the IMF's public concerns about the banking law—that they point to disagreements on 'key principles' rather than just 'finalizing details'—is a sharp insight that suggests the gap between the parties is wider than the Lebanese officials' optimism implies. This argument compellingly reframes the situation from 'difficult but possible' to 'highly improbable' within the given timeframe.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast. My initial assessment of 35% correctly identified the competing factors but did not sufficiently weigh the deep-seated political inertia that has prevented these exact reforms for years. Forecaster 3's arguments have convinced me that the one-month deadline, combined with the fundamental nature of the disagreements on the bank-restructuring law, makes a successful resolution before July 1 a significantly less likely outcome. The IMF's public statement characterizing progress as 'slow' and expressing specific concerns is a powerful negative signal that outweighs the optimistic rhetoric from the Lebanese government. While the external pressure and the presence of the IMF mission in Beirut create a non-zero chance of a breakthrough—the political elite may finally decide the cost of inaction is too high—the historical precedent and the sheer difficulty of the required legislative process in such a short window point decisively towards the status quo of 'no agreement'. Therefore, I am reducing my probability by 10 percentage points to better reflect that while a 'Yes' outcome is possible, it is not probable.",
