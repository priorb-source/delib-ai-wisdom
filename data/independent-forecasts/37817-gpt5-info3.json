  "information": "Tourism in Palau is in a recovery phase. Visitor numbers from Europe reached 3,442 by December 2024, approaching pre-pandemic levels. The Palau Visitors Authority is promoting the destination by leveraging increased flight frequency with partners like China Airlines. Hong Kong Airlines also lists Koror as a destination within its network. Prior to the pandemic, several South Korean airlines, including Air Seoul and T'way, operated services to Palau. A previous service between Narita and Koror operated by Delta Air Lines was suspended in May 2018.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (≈41 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By early July, flightsfrom.com lists only Taipei (China Airlines), Guam (United), and possibly Yap (United) plus at most one additional seasonal/charter destination, keeping Koror at 3–5 direct destinations total.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Multiple resumptions/launches are active for summer 2025 so that flightsfrom.com shows at least six destinations, e.g., the current TPE and GUM (and YAP if operating) plus new/seasonal services such as Seoul (a Korean LCC), Hong Kong (Hong Kong Airlines), and one of Manila or Tokyo.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: Palau is a very small market still recovering. The linked article notes flight volume has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, and South Korean demand has been weak. Small islands typically have few scheduled routes. My prior is that ROR currently has 2–4 scheduled destinations (very likely TPE and GUM; YAP uncertain due to intermittent service). Crossing >5 would require at least two or three additional routes operating in the summer schedule.\n- Evidence pointing up: The research assistant notes China Airlines increasing frequency (supports TPE’s stability) and that Hong Kong Airlines includes Koror in its network, and that pre-pandemic several Korean LCCs served Palau. Summer is peak season, so if resumptions were to happen in 2025, July–Aug would be attractive.\n- Evidence pointing down: Route launches usually have long lead times and marketing; with ~6 weeks left, multiple new starts by July are unlikely unless already announced and filed. PRC group travel complications to Palau persist, limiting China-sourced growth. Japan service has not been scheduled since 2018 except occasional charters. Korean carriers have been slow to return per the background article. Even if one of HKG or ICN resumes, you’d still need one or two more destinations to clear 6.\n- Flightsfrom.com nuance: In July, the site typically shows the Summer schedule by default. Winter-only or far-future seasonal services may not appear, making it harder to hit >5 unless routes are active in summer.\n- Why not higher: Achieving 6+ requires several independent airline decisions in a short window, against tepid demand signals. No strong public evidence of two or more additional summer 2025 starts beyond TPE/GUM/(YAP).\n- Why not lower: There is some chance that at least two of HKG and ICN and perhaps a Philippines or Japan seasonal charter are scheduled for summer and already filed, which could push the count to 6 on flightsfrom.com.\n- What would move me up: Confirmed schedules for summer 2025 from any two among Hong Kong Airlines (HKG), a Korean LCC (ICN), and a Philippines or Japan carrier (MNL/NRT), visible on flightsfrom.com or airline timetables. Government subsidy announcements or tour-operator blocks indicating sustained seasonal services.\n- What would move me down: Evidence that United’s YAP service remains suspended this summer, or that only TPE and GUM are operating; cancellations/delays of any mooted HKG/ICN services.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 5 direct flight destinations from Koror, Palau on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMarketplace: [Why hasn’t tourism recovered in Palau? Flights haven’t restarted in high volume since the pandemic drop-off, and South Koreans are booking their vacations elsewhere.](https://www.marketplace.org/story/2024/04/19/palau-tourism)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 5 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Koror (ROR)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/ROR) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nTourism in Palau is in a recovery phase.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
