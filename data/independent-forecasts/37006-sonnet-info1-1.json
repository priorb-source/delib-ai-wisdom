  "information": "In the 2019 and 2021 Canadian federal elections, the Bloc Québécois won 32 seats in Quebec, while the Conservative Party of Canada won 10 seats in each of those elections. Historically, the Bloc has won more seats in Quebec than the Conservatives in the last five to seven elections.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The 2025 Canadian federal election is expected to occur within the next 6-8 months, likely in October 2025, meaning approximately 5-7 months remain until the outcome is known.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo outcome is Yes - the Bloc Québécois winning more seats than the Conservatives in Quebec. In both 2019 and 2021 elections, the Bloc won 32 seats while the Conservatives won only 10 seats each time, representing a decisive 22-seat margin. This pattern has been consistent across the last 5-7 elections.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A No outcome would require the Conservatives to win at least as many seats as the Bloc in Quebec. This could occur if Mark Carney's leadership of the Liberals causes a major realignment that somehow benefits Conservatives, or if there's a dramatic collapse of Bloc support toward the Conservatives specifically. The Carney surge mentioned in the first article would need to not only hurt the Bloc but specifically redirect those voters to Conservatives rather than Liberals.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A Yes outcome maintains the historical pattern where the Bloc continues to dominate Quebec federal politics relative to the Conservatives. The second article noting that Conservative disorganization in Quebec City is benefiting the Bloc suggests this scenario is playing out. Quebec voters continue to prefer the Bloc's sovereignty platform or strategic positioning over Conservative policies, and the roughly 3:1 seat advantage persists.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome given the substantial historical evidence. The Bloc has maintained a decisive 22-seat advantage over Conservatives in recent elections (32 vs 10 in both 2019 and 2021), and this pattern extends back 5-7 elections according to my research assistant. This represents a 3:1 advantage that would be extraordinary to reverse in a single election cycle. Key evidence supporting a high probability includes: (1) the second article indicates Conservative organizational problems in Quebec, with inability to field candidates in Quebec City benefiting the Bloc, not hurting them; (2) while the first article discusses Carney's potential to hurt the Bloc, this would likely benefit Liberals primarily, not necessarily Conservatives; (3) Quebec's political culture has consistently favored the Bloc over federal Conservative parties. The forecast is not higher (95%+) because the Carney factor introduces genuine uncertainty about Quebec electoral dynamics, and major party realignments, while rare, do occasionally occur. The forecast is not lower (below 75%) because there's no concrete evidence of a Conservative surge in Quebec—in fact, the second article suggests the opposite. For me to revise higher, I'd need polling showing the Conservative campaign in Quebec is performing poorly or the Bloc maintaining its historical dominance. To revise lower, I'd need multiple polls showing Conservatives making dramatic inroads specifically in Quebec seats, or evidence that the disruption from Carney is somehow redirecting sovereigntist voters to Conservatives rather than Liberals.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Bloc Québécois win more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Carney’s Surge in Quebec Could Wipe the Sovereigntist Party Off the Map](https://thewalrus.ca/carneys-surge-in-quebec-could-wipe-the-sovereigntist-party-off-the-map/) | [In Quebec City, a Conservative candidate cannot run and the Bloc is benefitting](https://nationalpost.com/news/in-quebec-city-a-conservative-candidate-cannot-run-and-the-bloc-is-benefitting)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Bloc Québécois party wins more seats in Quebec than the Conservative Party of Canada in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
