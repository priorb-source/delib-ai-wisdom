  "information": "Forward-looking indicators for May 2025 presented a mixed picture. The flash ISM manufacturing PMI for May was above the 50-point growth threshold, and the S&P Global PMI also rose. However, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) fell by 1.0%, its largest drop since March 2023, and the core Producer Price Index (PPI) saw its first decline since 2020. Hard data proxies were also varied: aggregate hours worked in manufacturing were flat in April, while May's rail car-loadings and electricity output were tracking close to April's levels. Auto assemblies rebounded following shutdowns in the first quarter.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The data for May 2025 is scheduled to be released by the Federal Reserve around June 15, 2025. As today is June 2, 2025, the outcome will be known in approximately two weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The most recent data available is for April 2025, which showed a positive year-over-year growth of 1.48803%. The status quo is therefore continued modest positive growth.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome scenario would see the negative forward-looking indicators materialize immediately. The significant 1.0% drop in the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index (LEI) and the first decline in core Producer Price Index (PPI) since 2020 could signal a sharp drop in demand that forces manufacturers to curtail production, causing the May 2025 index level to fall below that of May 2024.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome scenario relies on the strength of current activity indicators. Positive flash ISM and S&P Global PMI readings for May suggest the manufacturing sector is expanding. This, combined with a confirmed rebound in auto assemblies, would be sufficient to lift the total industrial production index above its May 2024 level, resulting in positive year-over-year growth.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards a 'Yes' outcome, primarily based on the status quo and direct, high-frequency indicators for May 2025. The most recent data for April showed positive year-over-year growth, and economic momentum often has inertia. More importantly, the research provided indicates that both the ISM and S&P Global manufacturing PMIs for May were in expansionary territory (>50). These are reliable, timely indicators of manufacturing activity, which is the largest component of industrial production. The reported rebound in auto assemblies provides further tangible evidence of growth in a key sub-sector during the month.\n\nHowever, I am not more confident in this forecast because of significant countervailing evidence. The 1.0% drop in the Leading Economic Index (LEI) is a serious warning sign for future economic activity, and the decline in the core PPI suggests weakening demand and pricing power. These factors point to a slowdown or potential contraction in the coming months. While I believe their main impact may be felt after May, they create considerable uncertainty and cap the upside potential for May's production figures.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the positive PMIs and auto production data are more direct and current measures for May's activity than the broader, more forward-looking LEI. It would be premature to forecast a contraction when immediate activity indicators are positive. \n\nI would increase my probability if other concurrent data, such as mining output or utilities production for May, showed unexpected strength. I would decrease my probability if the base effect from a particularly strong May 2024 makes the year-over-year comparison difficult, or if the preliminary industrial production data release shows that the negative signals from the LEI and PPI had a more immediate and severe impact than anticipated.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill monthly US Industrial production have positive year-over-year growth for May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Real Economy Blog: [Industrial production index hits record high amid tariffs](https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/industrial-production-index-rises-to-record-amid-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the monthly number displayed at FRED [Industrial Production: Total Index (INDPRO)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/INDPRO#) for year-over-year growth is greater than 0.0 for May 2025, when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nWhen accessing the data, ensure settings are Units: Percent Change from Year Ago, Seasonally Adjusted and Frequency: Monthly. For example, the number for April 2025 was 1.48803 as of May 27, 2025.\n\nSince the numbers presented by FRED are expected to be preliminary numbers from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, please note that subsequent revisions to the number will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nForward-looking indicators for May 2025 presented a mixed picture.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
