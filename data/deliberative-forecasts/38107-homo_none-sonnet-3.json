    "review": "All three forecasts converge tightly in the 2-4% range, showing strong analytical consensus. The other forecasters raise several valuable points I hadn't fully emphasized: (1) The Secret Service being in the 'asking phase' per the article suggests early investigation, not imminent action - this is an important detail that reinforces low probability; (2) The specific legal standard of 'true threat' under First Amendment doctrine is relevant, and symbolic/artistic expression like seashells is particularly difficult to prosecute; (3) The empirical observation that Secret Service inquiries rarely result in arrests of high-profile figures is useful; (4) Both forecasters emphasized more than I did that the question resolves Yes for arrest 'anywhere for any reason,' which does marginally broaden the scope. However, I already incorporated most of these considerations implicitly - First Amendment protections, investigation timeline, base rates, and the broad definition of arrest. The core reasoning across all three analyses is remarkably similar, which increases my confidence in the general probability range but suggests a slight upward adjustment is warranted.",
    "rationale": "My original 2% forecast was soundly reasoned but perhaps slightly too confident. The convergence of independent analyses at 2-4% with a center around 3% suggests this is the appropriate range. The emphasis from other forecasters on the 'any reason' provision is well-taken - while arrest related to this specific investigation is extremely unlikely, the theoretical possibility of arrest for any unrelated matter over the next 32 days adds marginal probability. The detail that Secret Service is still 'asking' about the photo (early investigation phase) actually reinforces the low probability, as does the lack of any movement toward arrest in the two weeks since the article. The base rate remains the dominant factor: former FBI directors simply don't get arrested. Combined with First Amendment protections, the compressed timeline, political sensitivity requiring overwhelming evidence, and the 'true threat' legal standard that symbolic expression rarely meets, arrest remains highly unlikely. However, acknowledging collective forecaster wisdom and the slight broadening from 'any reason,' I'm updating from 2% to 3%.",
