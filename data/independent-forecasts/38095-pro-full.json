  "information": "In late May 2025, President Trump granted clemency to a large group of individuals. News outlets including The Hill and Politomix reported on May 28-29 that over two dozen people received pardons or commutations in what was described as a 'clemency spree' or 'blitz'. According to Office of the Pardon Attorney data, there were approximately 25 clemency actions in May. The recipients included political allies like former Congressman Michael Grimm and former Connecticut governor John G. Rowland, reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, and musicians such as NBA YoungBoy.\n\nSince taking office in January 2025, President Trump has granted approximately 1,600 pardons or commutations, a figure more than six times the total from his entire first term. A large portion of this number stems from a mass clemency order issued on his first day in office, which pardoned roughly 1,500 individuals convicted of offenses related to the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack. The administration has installed key personnel to manage the process, including Ed Martin as the new pardon attorney at the Justice Department and Alice Marie Johnson as a White House pardon czar.\n\nDuring his first presidential term, Donald Trump did not grant any clemencies during the month of June in any of the four years. For his second term, a May 28, 2025, report from the Washington Times indicated that Trump has signaled more pardons could be forthcoming, including for two men convicted in the plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. A White House official was also quoted stating the President has come to the aid of political supporters and donors and has expressed sympathy for allies caught in the judicial system.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with the outcome known after June 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The current status quo involves a high frequency and volume of executive clemencies. The recent 'clemency spree' in late May 2025 and the established pardon infrastructure suggest a continuation of this pattern. Therefore, the status quo outcome is 'Yes'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration considers the late-May 2025 'clemency blitz' to have cleared a significant backlog of cases, leading to a lull in activity in June. Alternatively, a major domestic or international crisis could consume the White House's attention, pushing pardons down the priority list for the month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The high pace of pardons established in the second term continues. The dedicated pardon infrastructure, led by Ed Martin and Alice Marie Johnson, processes another batch of clemencies which are then announced in June, easily exceeding the threshold of two individuals.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong evidence of President Trump's highly active use of clemency powers in his second term. The research indicates approximately 1,600 clemencies have been granted since January 2025, with a recent 'blitz' of over two dozen in late May 2025. This establishes a clear pattern of frequent, large-scale clemency actions, supported by a dedicated White House and Justice Department infrastructure. This recent, high-volume activity is a much stronger predictor of future behavior than his first-term record, where no clemencies were granted in any June. The specific mention of more pardons being forthcoming for controversial figures suggests the process remains a high priority for the administration. My probability is not higher because presidential actions, particularly pardons, can be unpredictable and clustered. The large number of pardons in late May could potentially lead to a brief pause in June. There is also the possibility of an unforeseen event diverting the administration's focus. My probability is not lower because the current momentum and established system for processing pardons strongly favors continued action. For this administration, a full month with two or fewer clemencies would be a significant deviation from the established norm. I would increase my forecast if there were specific White House leaks or announcements indicating a batch of pardons is planned for June. I would decrease it if a major national crisis emerged or if key figures in the pardon process were to depart.",
