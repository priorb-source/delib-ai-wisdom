  "information": "On May 6, 2025, Ramzan Kadyrov publicly stated that he was asking to be relieved of his duties, expressing a hope that his request would be supported to allow for new leadership in the region. He subsequently clarified on his Telegram channel that the final decision rests solely with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating, \"I do not decide whether I will remain as the head of the Chechen Republic or not.\" By May 12, Kadyrov again addressed the rumors, attributing his recent serious demeanor not to a potential resignation, but to the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, in which he said 11,000 Chechen troops were involved.\n\nMultiple media outlets, including Novaya Gazeta Europe, The Insider, and the Kyiv Independent, have reported on Kadyrov's deteriorating health, with some specifying conditions such as pancreatic necrosis and kidney problems. In parallel, reports indicate Kadyrov is engaged in succession planning. He has promoted his 17-year-old son, Adam Kadyrov, to several high-ranking positions, including secretary of the republic's security council and head of his own security department. Kadyrov's 26-year-old daughter, Aishat, also holds the position of vice-president of the Chechen government.\n\nRamzan Kadyrov met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on May 7, 2025. Following the meeting, Kadyrov stated he received \"full understanding and support,\" and Russian state media reported that Putin praised the Chechen Republic's achievements. This is not the first time Kadyrov has publicly discussed stepping down; similar statements were made in 2016, 2020, and 2022, none of which resulted in his departure. The authority to appoint or dismiss the Head of the Chechen Republic rests exclusively with the President of Russia. Kadyrov has held the position since April 2007.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 20 days (until 2025-06-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Kadyrov remains Head of the Chechen Republic through June 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Putin declines or stalls Kadyrov’s request; Kadyrov continues as head while delegating more day-to-day duties to trusted lieutenants/family. Health rumors persist but no official change is made before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Kremlin issues a decree dismissing/relieving Kadyrov and appoints an acting head, or Kadyrov dies/becomes incapacitated and a successor is named; credible outlets report he has ceased to be head before June 1.",
    "rationale": "- Timeframe is very short. With ~20 days left, the base rate favors no change. In Russian regional leadership transitions, even when signaled, the Kremlin often times moves carefully unless urgent.\n- Signals for change: On May 6 Kadyrov publicly asked to be relieved; credible reporting suggests deteriorating health; visible succession grooming (notably son Adam and daughter Aishat). He met Putin on May 7 and said the decision rests solely with the president. These are nontrivial indicators that a managed transition is being contemplated.\n- Signals for continuity: Similar public musings about stepping down occurred in 2016, 2020, and 2022 without consequence. After the May 7 meeting, state media emphasized achievements rather than transition; as of May 12 there is no decree or clear preparatory choreography for an imminent replacement. Putin prizes stability in Chechnya during wartime; Adam Kadyrov is too young to be a formal successor now, complicating immediate handover.\n- Weighting: Status quo inertia and Kremlin control over timing dominate in a 3-week window. However, the explicit request plus health concerns materially raise the near-term hazard versus baseline.\n- Why not higher: No official steps yet; past false alarms; Putin’s incentives for short-term stability; typical practice of appointing an acting head would likely be telegraphed shortly after a high-profile Kremlin meeting if imminent.\n- Why not lower: Kadyrov himself said he asked to step down; multiple reports of serious health issues; visible succession planning; a sudden health event or a rapid Kremlin decision could trigger immediate replacement.\n- Updaters upward: Kremlin or Chechen Parliament calendar moves suggesting a personnel decree; credible reports of hospitalization/incapacitation; removal of Kadyrov from official sites; state media introducing a clear successor figure; unusual security activity in Grozny.\n- Updaters downward: Fresh, sustained public appearances by Kadyrov looking vigorous; explicit Kremlin denial of any change; new honors/appointments strengthening his position; signals that any transition is slated for later in the year.\nSummary of assistant’s inputs used: Kadyrov’s May 6 request; May 7 Putin meeting; May 12 clarification; repeated historical step-down talk without action; health reports (pancreatic/kidney issues); promotions of Adam and Aishat; Putin’s sole authority to appoint/dismiss; Kadyrov in office since 2007.",
