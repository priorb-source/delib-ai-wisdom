    "review": "Both forecasters add useful nuance. Forecaster 2’s emphasis on the clear UD in the first meeting and the repeatability of Merab’s cardio/chain-wrestling edge is compelling, as is the explicit accounting for draw/NC and late-change risk. Forecaster 3 introduces new (and plausible) information about O’Malley’s hip surgery and first-fight-back uncertainty; that cuts both ways (healthier movement vs. ring rust) but modestly tilts against O’Malley given the specific grappling deficit. I also agree with their caution that modern judging favors damage, which slightly tempers Merab’s edge if control isn’t paired with offense. I weigh the prior head-to-head and stylistic persistence more than I weigh speculative camp reports; I lightly incorporate the surgery note. Overall, their inputs push me a bit upward from my initial estimate.",
    "rationale": "Update decomposition: (1) Fight occurrence: with ~two weeks to go, main-event fallout risk is typically around 8–12%. Merab’s minor finger/toe issues keep that non-zero; I set P(fight happens) ≈ 0.90. (2) Conditional win chance: The prior clear UD plus Merab’s repeatable path (pace, chain wrestling, clinch control, cardio) support ~61–64%. Offsetting factors: O’Malley’s high KO equity on entries, rematch adjustments, judging weighting damage over control, and small draw/NC risk. I set P(Merab wins | fight) ≈ 62%. Unconditional: 0.90 × 0.62 ≈ 0.56. Net: modest uptick from my prior 52% given the corroborated first-fight result and typical rematch dynamics, while still discounting for late-change risk and O’Malley’s finishing threat.",
