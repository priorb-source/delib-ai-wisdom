    "review": "My fellow forecasters and I identified the same core tension: a significant surge in polling for Reform UK versus the powerful structural barriers of the first-past-the-post (FPTP) system and strong Conservative incumbency. We all referenced the same key data points: the 2021 results, the Electoral Calculus poll, John Curtice's analysis, and the historical precedent of UKIP's peak performance. The key difference was the weight assigned to these factors. I found the other forecasters' reasoning convincing, particularly their emphasis on the scale of the challenge. They rightly pointed out that a single poll, while notable, may not be sufficient evidence to predict that Reform can overcome the inefficiencies of FPTP to the degree necessary to win the most seats. Their heavier reliance on the UKIP high-water mark of 17 seats as a more realistic anchor for a challenger party's performance has caused me to reconsider the weight I gave to the outlier poll.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am revising my forecast downwards. My initial forecast of 25% was heavily influenced by the Electoral Calculus poll and the volatile national political environment, suggesting a major political realignment was plausible. However, my fellow forecasters made a compelling case that I underweighted the structural resilience of the Conservative party in Kent and the enormous difficulty of translating a national polling surge into a plurality of seats under FPTP. The comparison to UKIP's peak of 17 seats is a powerful anchor; for Reform to win the most seats, they would have to nearly double the best-ever performance of a similar predecessor party. This is an exceptionally high bar. The consensus view that the FPTP system is likely to blunt Reform's challenge by spreading their vote too thinly across many divisions is persuasive. Therefore, I am reducing my probability from 25% to 18%. This revised forecast still acknowledges a significant, non-trivial chance of an upset but better reflects the immense structural hurdles Reform UK must overcome.",
