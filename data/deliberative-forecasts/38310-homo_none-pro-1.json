    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, have independently arrived at the identical forecast of 90% based on a nearly identical set of core arguments. The consensus is exceptionally strong. The primary factors cited by all are the strong precedent of President Zelenskyy's attendance at the 2023 and 2024 G7 summits, the overwhelming strategic necessity for him to be there in person to lobby for critical aid, and the fact that an invitation from the host nation has already been extended. The other forecasters and I agree that the main source of uncertainty, accounting for the 10% chance of a 'No' outcome, is the inherent volatility of leading a country at war—specifically, a sudden military crisis or a direct security threat. Forecaster 2's framing of his travel as a 'routine, albeit high-risk, part of his wartime presidency' was a particularly insightful point that I had not explicitly stated, but it reinforces the 'Yes' case by suggesting the logistical and security challenges are well-understood and managed. No new evidence was presented that would fundamentally shift the probability.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from the other forecasters, I am maintaining my forecast of 90%. The deliberation process has strongly reinforced my initial reasoning. There's a clear consensus that the combination of strong precedent (attending the last two G7 summits in person) and immense strategic motivation (securing vital support for the war effort) makes his attendance the overwhelmingly likely outcome. The arguments from my peers confirmed that the key variables have been correctly identified. I found Forecaster 2's point about his high-stakes travel becoming 'routine' to be a useful lens; it suggests the logistical and security apparatus to make such trips happen is robust and has been tested, which solidifies the high probability of a 'Yes' outcome. However, this does not eliminate the primary risks. All three of us correctly reserved a 10% probability for a 'No' outcome to account for the non-trivial chance of a sudden, high-impact event, such as a major military crisis on the front lines requiring his presence in Ukraine or a specific, credible security threat that makes travel untenable. As there is no new conflicting information and the core logic is sound and shared, I see no reason to adjust my forecast up or down.",
