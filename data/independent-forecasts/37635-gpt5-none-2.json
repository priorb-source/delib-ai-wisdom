    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (until June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes (Milei 61% vs Sheinbaum 60% at Morning Consult)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sheinbaum’s approval ticks up a couple points (e.g., to ~62%) while Milei is flat or down a point; or they tie, which resolves as No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milei maintains or widens a slim lead—e.g., continued positive macro headlines in Argentina (falling inflation, legislative wins) keep him at ~61–63% while Sheinbaum stays ~59–61%.",
    "rationale": "With roughly six weeks left and a current 1-point edge for Milei, the baseline favors Yes. Morning Consult’s weekly tracker typically moves slowly, but 1-point gaps can flip on normal week-to-week variation. I expect both series to be fairly stable, with modest volatility (a few points over a month or two). Two fundamentals: (1) Sheinbaum is still in an early-term period where Mexican presidents often sustain high approvals near 60%, so an uptick for her is plausible. (2) Milei’s recent macro tailwinds (inflation deceleration, fiscal consolidation, and potential legislative progress) support him holding near or slightly above 60%. Netting these, I give a slight edge to Milei remaining ahead, but not by much because the lead is within typical noise and a tie counts as No. The research assistant provided no extra information, so I’m leaning mainly on the present gap, historical volatility of the MC series, and qualitative fundamentals. Not higher: the margin is only 1 point; normal noise or a positive news cycle in Mexico could flip it, and ties resolve No. Not lower: Milei already leads and has plausible near-term positive momentum; Sheinbaum’s series may be stable rather than rising. I would move higher if Morning Consult shows Milei opening a ≥2–3 point lead or if Argentina posts clear, widely covered positive economic surprises or legislative wins. I would move lower if Sheinbaum overtakes or closes to a tie in the next update, or if Argentina sees economic/backlash headlines that dent Milei’s standing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Javier Milei have a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, Sheinbaum is at 60% as compared with Milei at 61%.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Javier Milei has a higher approval rating than Claudia Sheinbaum at [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. A tie or a lead by Sheinbaum resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
