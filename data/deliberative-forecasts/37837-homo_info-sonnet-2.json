    "review": "Forecaster 2 presents highly specific and decisive evidence that fundamentally changes this forecast. They claim all months in 2023 exceeded 600, all 2024 months exceeded 450, and 2025's first four months averaged 517 - representing 28 consecutive months above the 400 threshold. If accurate, this data makes my 58% forecast far too conservative, as it was based on outdated 50-year averages rather than recent trends. Forecaster 3's 38% forecast appears to suffer from the same limitation - relying on historical baseline without recent data. The key question is whether Forecaster 2's data is accurate. Their specificity (exact monthly counts, consistent patterns across multiple years) suggests genuine access to recent NUFORC data rather than speculation. The 29% buffer above threshold (517 vs 400) is substantial. However, I cannot independently verify these numbers, and there's always risk of data errors or reporting changes. Forecaster 3's point about the Contact in the Desert conference is interesting but minor compared to the trend evidence.",
    "rationale": "If Forecaster 2's data is even approximately correct, the evidence overwhelmingly favors Yes. A 28-month streak where every single month exceeded 400 - with recent months far exceeding it - establishes an extremely robust pattern. For June 2025 to fall below 400 would require a dramatic and unexpected break from this trend. While I maintain some uncertainty because I cannot verify the specific numbers and unexpected changes can occur, the preponderance of evidence now strongly points toward exceeding 400. My original forecast of 58% was anchored too heavily on outdated historical averages. The recent trend data, if accurate, should dominate my forecast. I'm updating to 78% rather than matching Forecaster 2's 87% because: (1) I'm accounting for uncertainty in the data accuracy, (2) preserving some probability for unforeseen trend breaks, and (3) acknowledging we don't yet have May 2025 data to confirm the trend continues through the most recent month.",
