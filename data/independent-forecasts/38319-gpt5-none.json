    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 17 days (expected around June 21, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Slight month-over-month increase continues, following March’s rebound.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The strong +7.6% March rebound proves front‑loaded; auto and electronics output normalize or give back gains, and April sees a mild pullback (negative MoM) due to mean reversion, temporary outages, or softer new orders.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Plants that restarted or ramped in March keep scaling in April; weak yen supports export-oriented sectors (autos, electronics), and inventory rebuilding continues, yielding another (even if modest) MoM increase.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: Tohoku’s March industrial production (\"生産\") rose 7.6% m/m, the first increase in three months (per the cited article). The April 2025 result will be published around June 21. No additional assistant intel beyond that.\n- Base rate: For seasonally adjusted industrial production, month-to-month changes are roughly a coin flip around zero. Regional series can be volatile, but the unconditional chance of a positive print is near 50%.\n- Status quo weighting: After a large positive month tied to restarts/ramp-ups, the most common outcomes are either a modest continuation or some mean reversion. Given Japan’s weak yen into spring 2025 (a tailwind for exporters) and the likelihood that March’s increase reflected real production normalization (not just one-off statistical noise), I lean slightly toward continuation rather than a full giveback.\n- Push factors toward Yes: momentum from March restarts, export competitiveness from a weak yen, and possible inventory rebuilding in autos/electronics—key Tohoku sectors (Toyota Motor East Japan and other suppliers in the region).\n- Pull factors toward No: sizable mean reversion risk after a +7.6% jump, regional volatility, and potential idiosyncratic plant adjustments or supply hiccups that can easily push a single month negative.\n- Why not higher: The March surge was large; such jumps are often followed by partial retracement. Without confirmed nationwide April IP or sectoral clues, pushing much above the mid-50s would overstate confidence.\n- Why not lower: The prior three-month slump followed by a strong rebound suggests normalization rather than a fleeting blip; currency tailwinds and ongoing ramping make a complete reversal less likely than a small positive or flat outcome.\n- What would move me: If nationwide April IP (prelim/final) is clearly positive and autos/electronics show gains, I’d move into the 60–65% range. If nationwide IP is negative, auto output setbacks are reported, or there are Tohoku-specific outages, I’d drop to ~40–45%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Northeast Japan region (Tohoku) show a month-over-month increase in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tohoku's March industrial production index rises 7.6% from the previous month, the first increase in three months](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCC214DI0R20C25A5000000/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [industrial production announcement](https://www.tohoku.meti.go.jp/cyosa/tokei/iip.html) for April 2025 (expected approximately June 21, 2025) reports a monthly change in production (\"生産\") of greater than 0.0%.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
