    "review": "The other forecasters introduced a crucial piece of evidence that I had missed: specific base rate data for similar recalls. Forecaster 2's analysis, noting a 70-day median closure time for medium-scale allergen recalls, was particularly compelling. With a 68-day resolution window (April 24 to July 1), this data immediately anchors the probability near 50%, revealing that my initial forecast of 75% was far too optimistic and based on overly broad heuristics. Forecaster 3 reinforced this more moderate view and added the valuable consideration of potential administrative lag in updating the USDA website, which would resolve as 'No' even if the recall were substantively complete. Both analyses correctly identified the key push-pull factors, but their use of quantitative and specific procedural anchors provided a much stronger foundation for their forecasts than my initial qualitative assessment.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 75% was too high, as it overweighted the simplifying factors (allergen type, single state) without a proper statistical anchor. The base rate data provided by Forecaster 2, indicating a 70-day median closure time for comparable recalls, fundamentally changes my assessment. This question's 68-day window places the resolution right at the historical median, making a 50% probability the correct starting point. The debate then becomes how to adjust based on the specific features of this case. Factors suggesting a slower-than-median resolution (a 'No' outcome) include the very long one-year production window and the product's frozen nature, which complicate the verification process, plus the risk of website update delays. Factors suggesting a faster-than-median resolution (a 'Yes' outcome) are primarily the recall's limited geographic scope (New York only), which dramatically simplifies logistics compared to multi-state recalls that are likely included in the base rate statistics. I believe the logistical simplification of a single-state recall is a significant factor that will likely expedite the closure process more than the long production window will delay it. Therefore, I assess the probability as slightly better than the 50% median baseline. I am significantly updating my forecast downward from 75% to 55% to reflect the powerful influence of the base rate data, while still maintaining that the specific characteristics of this case favor a 'Yes' outcome, albeit only slightly.",
