  "information": "The Diversity Visa program was established by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Trump administration, which began in January 2025, has previously expressed opposition to the program. The administration issued executive orders in January 2025 concerning Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) related websites across federal agencies. In April 2025, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives with the goal of terminating the statutory DV program.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 42 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the Step 1 “Submit an Entry” DV instructions page remains at the specified URL.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Congress passes and the President signs legislation terminating the DV program before July 1, and State promptly removes or replaces the Step 1 page (or it stops containing registration instructions). Alternatively, State restructures travel.state.gov and the specific URL 404s or redirects to a page that is not the Step 1 instructions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "No legislative change by July 1 and State leaves the DV pages as-is; the Step 1 instructions page remains online (likely noting the entry period is closed until fall) at the same URL.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: The DV program is statutory (Immigration Act of 1990). Even administrations that oppose it (e.g., 2017–2020) kept the DV instruction pages accessible year-round, typically with “entry period closed” messaging. Government web content and URL structures are sticky over short horizons, and July 1 is well before the usual October–November entry period.\n- Timeline: With ~6 weeks to go, it is unlikely that a bill introduced in April to terminate DV will clear both chambers, be signed, and be implemented with immediate website changes by July 1. Immigration overhauls historically take longer, and similar past efforts to end DV have often stalled.\n- Admin actions: While the administration issued EO(s) about DEI-related web content, the DV program is not a DEI initiative; it’s a visa category in statute. Unilateral removal of functional program pages risks legal exposure. Even a hostile administration previously left these pages up.\n- Risks keeping this below 100%: (1) A rapid legislative push that terminates DV with immediate effect and prompts quick website changes; (2) an agency web reorganization that changes or retires the specific URL; (3) a policy directive causing premature removal or replacement of the Step 1 page content so it no longer contains entry instructions.\n- Update triggers: I would lower the probability if the House bill gains swift bicameral momentum, if the White House or State signals intent to halt DV imminently, or if State begins a travel.state.gov restructure impacting visa subpages. I would raise it if the bill stalls, Senate floor time looks constrained, or State confirms DV-2027 planning/maintains current DV content structure.\n- Research assistant summary used: Trump admin began Jan 2025; EOs on DEI-related websites; April 2025 bill to terminate DV introduced. These increase downside tail risk but do not outweigh status quo inertia over a short time window.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US State Department's Diversity Visa page still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | [Donald Trump's 2017 tweet discussing the DV program](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925684982307348480)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Step 1 Submit an Entry page with instructions for registering for the Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) Program is at [this location](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html) when attempted to be accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Diversity Visa program was established by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Trump administration, which began in January 2025, has previously expressed opposition to the program. The administration issued executive orders in January 2025 concerning Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) related websites across federal agencies. In April 2025, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives with the goal of terminating the statutory DV program.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
