    "review": "Forecaster 2 presents a dramatically different picture than I had, claiming specific polling data showing SPÖ leading 38-40% versus FPÖ at 21-24% with the election less than a week away. If accurate, this polling data combined with the proximity to election day would indeed justify extreme confidence. However, I note some tension: if the SPÖ has such a commanding lead, why frame this as a competitive question? Forecaster 3 takes a more cautious middle ground at 68%, acknowledging FPÖ national momentum and real upset potential, but this seems to underweight the historical precedent I emphasized. The critical new information is the timeline - if we're truly 6 days from the election, that drastically reduces the window for change and makes current polling far more predictive than I initially weighted.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating my forecast upward based on three key factors: (1) The apparent proximity to election day (less than a week) significantly constrains the possibility of major shifts, making current status quo outcomes much more likely. (2) Even without seeing the exact polling myself, if there are recent polls showing SPÖ ahead - even if by less than Forecaster 2's claimed 16-19 points - combined with 80 years of dominance, this strongly favors a Yes outcome. (3) The structural advantages I identified (incumbency, organization, opposition fragmentation) become even more decisive in the final week when persuasion opportunities are limited. However, I'm not moving to 97% because: (a) I cannot independently verify the specific polling claims; (b) Forecaster 3 raises valid concerns about FPÖ momentum that deserve consideration; (c) Recent European elections have shown late movements can occur; (d) The question itself implies some competitive uncertainty. My updated forecast of 86% reflects high confidence while maintaining appropriate epistemic humility about information asymmetries.",
