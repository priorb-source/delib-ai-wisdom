    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I are closely aligned at 5% and 8%, both emphasizing the short timeframe and lack of concrete procedural signals. Forecaster 3's 15% is notably higher, raising important considerations I had underweighted. F3's strongest argument is the AU summit mechanism - the AU does sometimes catalyze last-minute ratifications around major events, which could happen before July 1. F3 also usefully distinguishes between the HoR legislative path versus a potentially faster GNU executive pathway, though this raises legitimacy questions. F2 makes an excellent point about the October 2025 deadline for AfCFTA rules of origin reducing immediate urgency to ratify now - why rush when key operational details won't be settled until after the July 1 deadline anyway? The continental momentum argument (49/54 joined) has merit, though being a holdout hasn't motivated ratification in the past 4+ years since AfCFTA's 2021 operationalization. All three of us note the complete absence of procedural signals - no draft bill, no cabinet announcement, no AU statements about imminent Libyan ratification. This silence is quite telling with only 61 days remaining.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm modestly updating upward from 8% to 10%. The key factor moving me up is Forecaster 3's AU summit mechanism, which I had insufficiently weighted. The AU does occasionally catalyze last-minute treaty ratifications around major summits or events, and such an event before July 1 is plausible. Additionally, the continental momentum factor (49/54 having joined) creates more peer pressure than I initially credited. However, I'm not moving all the way to 15% because: (1) the complete absence of any procedural signals as of May 1 with only 61 days left is highly significant, (2) Forecaster 2's point about reduced urgency given the October 2025 rules of origin deadline is compelling - there's less immediate benefit to rushing ratification now, (3) Libya's political fragmentation makes rapid action difficult regardless of pathway, and (4) the May 2025 evidence shows Libya prioritizing bilateral Turkey arrangements over multilateral frameworks. The 10% forecast reflects a very low but not negligible probability, acknowledging both the strong structural barriers and the small but real possibility of a surprise AU-catalyzed ratification or unexpected GNU executive action.",
