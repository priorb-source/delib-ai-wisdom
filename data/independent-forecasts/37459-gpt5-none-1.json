    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~8 days (13F due by 2025-05-15 for period ending 2025-03-31)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire makes no new Magnificent 7 purchases beyond Apple/Amazon through 2025-03-31, or any such purchase is kept under confidential treatment and therefore not reported on the Q1 2025 13F.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Q1 2025 13F lists a new holding in one of Alphabet or Meta (most plausible), or in Microsoft/Nvidia/Tesla (less likely), either initiated in Q1 or previously accumulated and now revealed.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and timing: The 13F will be public in about a week. Berkshire historically makes few new mega-cap tech additions; when they do, they are typically via Todd Combs or Ted Weschler and are small relative to the portfolio (e.g., Amazon, Snowflake). The default, slow-changing outcome is that no new Magnificent 7 beyond Apple and Amazon appears.\n- Company fit by name:\n  • Tesla: Extremely unlikely given long-standing skepticism and the BYD association.\n  • Nvidia: Buffett has praised it but also emphasizes not paying up for hard-to-predict tech leadership; buying near peak AI exuberance seems out of character.\n  • Microsoft: Historically avoided due to Buffett’s relationship with Bill Gates; while that constraint is looser now, it still makes MSFT less likely, and valuation is rich.\n  • Alphabet/Meta: Most plausible among the five—dominant franchises with strong cash generation; Todd/Ted could justify a small position even at elevated multiples.\n- Disclosure dynamics: Berkshire sometimes seeks confidential treatment when building a position (e.g., Chubb). If they chose to accumulate one of these names, the 13F might still omit it this quarter. For mega-caps with deep liquidity, confidentiality is less necessary, but it remains a non-trivial possibility that reduces the chance of a Yes under the question’s strict “reported on the 13F” criterion.\n- Cash and portfolio context: Berkshire’s record cash pile and ongoing Apple concentration create an incentive to add diversifying large, high-quality names, which marginally supports a Yes. Against that, recent valuations across the Magnificent 7 are elevated, and Berkshire has lately preferred buybacks, T-bills, and energy/financials—tilting back toward No.\n- Research assistant info: No additional information available; no recent signals pushing this away from the status quo.\n- Why not higher: Limited historical precedent of Berkshire adding new M7 names (other than Apple/Amazon), valuation headwinds, and the possibility of confidentiality even if they did buy.\n- Why not lower: Todd/Ted autonomy, precedent of Amazon, ample liquidity to initiate a modest stake without moving the price, and a small chance of a previously confidential position being revealed in this filing.\n- What could update me:\n  • Up: Credible pre-filing reporting/rumors, hints from Berkshire’s 2025 meeting commentary about adding a mega-cap tech outside Apple/Amazon, or evidence they reduced Apple to reallocate into another M7.\n  • Down: Signals of continued risk-off posture toward big tech, or reports of a new confidential treatment order likely covering any new large-cap tech purchases this quarter.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of any Magnificent 7 stock other than Amazon and Apple in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nInvestopedia: [Berkshire Hathaway Doesn't Hold Nvidia Stock—Will Warren Buffett Come to Regret it?](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/warren-buffetts-secret-portfolio-dumping-shares-3-supercharged-artificial-intelligence-ai)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding shares of Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
