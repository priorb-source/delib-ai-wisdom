    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises crucial new information I had not fully considered: Kneecap performed a surprise London gig on May 22 (one day AFTER being charged) and Wide Awake festival confirmed them on May 24. This is highly significant evidence that there are no immediate restrictive bail conditions preventing performances, which substantially reduces one of my key concerns. Forecaster 2's balanced analysis aligns well with mine, weighing status quo against real pressures. Forecaster 3, at 35%, appears to significantly overweight the severity of the situation relative to the evidence. While the terrorism charge is serious, the post-charge performances directly contradict the assumption that legal or security concerns will necessarily prevent appearance. Forecaster 3's focus on 'risk-averse decision-making' underestimates Glastonbury's specific institutional character - this is not a typical corporate-sponsored festival. The multiple venue cancellations mentioned by both forecasters (Eden Project, Plymouth Pavilions, German festivals) do show real commercial pressure exists, but Glastonbury occupies a unique position in UK festival culture with a history of backing controversial acts. The key tension is between demonstrated ability to perform (May 22-24 events) and ongoing political/commercial pressure.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, the most important new evidence is that Kneecap performed in London on May 22 (day after the charge) and was confirmed for Wide Awake on May 24. This substantially reduces concern about immediate legal restrictions preventing performance. My original 65% forecast may have been slightly too cautious given this evidence. The status quo remains strong: they're officially scheduled, Glastonbury hasn't wavered, and they're demonstrably able to perform in the UK post-charge. Against this: multiple venue cancellations show real pressure, ministerial calls for removal create political risk, and the June 18 court date creates uncertainty. However, Glastonbury's institutional character - progressive politics, resistance to external pressure, history of defending booked acts - makes them more likely than other venues to hold firm. The resolution criteria are also favorable, allowing performance even if one member is restricted. I'm updating slightly upward based on the post-charge performance evidence, but maintaining substantial downside risk due to the political pressure and court uncertainty. The forecast remains in the 'lean Yes' range but with meaningful probability of cancellation.",
