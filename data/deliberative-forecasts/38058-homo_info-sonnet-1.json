    "review": "The other forecasters provide solid analysis that largely aligns with my reasoning. Forecaster 2 raises an important point I hadn't explicitly considered: a 90-day pause on trade levies is approaching its end, which could trigger renewed intensive coverage rather than declining coverage during our window. This works against a Yes outcome. Forecaster 3 effectively emphasizes the enormous documented economic impact (job losses, price increases) and that we're already 7 days into the window with presumably continuous coverage. Both forecasters correctly stress that WSJ's business focus makes it particularly unlikely to drop economic/trade news. All three of us converge on similar reasoning: the status quo strongly favors continued coverage, BOTH papers must coincide on the same day (which is difficult), the front page definition is broad, but 34-36 days provides some opportunity for major breaking news to dominate. The forecast range of 20-28% reflects appropriate uncertainty about this low-probability but not impossible event.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward from 22% to 21%. The key new information is the 90-day pause on trade levies approaching its end, which Forecaster 2 highlighted. This suggests coverage intensity may actually increase during our remaining window rather than stabilize or decline. Combined with: (1) the EU tariff postponement to July 9 that I identified, (2) the enormous economic impacts Forecaster 3 emphasized, (3) WSJ's business-news focus making tariff omission particularly unlikely, and (4) the broad definition of 'front page' including news summaries, the probability of a Yes outcome is on the lower end of reasonable estimates. While 34 days still provides opportunities for extraordinary breaking news to dominate both front pages simultaneously, the convergence of multiple active tariff storylines (EU negotiations, 90-day pause ending, ongoing economic impacts) makes continuous coverage highly likely. I'm settling at 21% to reflect this slightly more conservative assessment while acknowledging that major unexpected events could still create the one required day.",
