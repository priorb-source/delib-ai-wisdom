    "review": "All three forecasts converge remarkably on 35-40%, which strengthens confidence in this range. We share core reasoning: the US has mobilization capacity, large protests are episodic requiring triggers, the 2-month window is short, and no specific catalyzing events are currently visible. Forecaster 2's base rate argument is interesting - if several large protests occur annually, 2 months represents ~1/6 of a year, suggesting higher probability. However, their 35% forecast indicates they appropriately weight the episodic nature over mechanical base rates. Forecaster 3 raises an important consideration I hadn't explicitly noted: uncertainty about the Global Protest Tracker's coverage methodology and reporting lag. This adds a layer of execution risk - even if a large protest occurs, will the tracker document it? However, given that the tracker is designed to monitor global protests and the US is a major democracy with transparent media coverage, this risk seems modest. Their 40% forecast suggests they agree. The seasonal factors mentioned (academic year ending, weather) are valid supporting points but already implicit in my analysis. No forecaster has identified information that fundamentally challenges the core assessment.",
    "rationale": "The strong convergence at 35-40% across independent analyses validates my original reasoning. The Global Protest Tracker coverage point adds a minor uncertainty layer, but for large US protests with transparent media coverage, documentation risk is low. Forecaster 2's base rate framing could justify moving slightly higher, but their own 35% forecast demonstrates appropriate caution about mechanical application of base rates given the episodic nature of large protests. The core dynamics remain: absent a triggering event, large protests are unlikely over this short window, but the contentious political environment and proven mobilization capacity prevent going much lower. Two months provides enough time for an event to emerge and mobilize, but there's currently no visible catalyst. The 30-45% range seems appropriate given uncertainty, and 35% sits comfortably in the middle-lower end, reflecting that the status quo of no major protest deserves substantial weight while acknowledging meaningful possibility of triggering events.",
