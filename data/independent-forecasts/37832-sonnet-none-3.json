    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Databricks does not announce IPO plans",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks maintains its current position as expressed by the CEO that it's 'dumb to IPO this year.' The company continues operating as a private entity, focusing on its business growth without making any public offering announcements before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite recent statements, Databricks reverses course due to changed market conditions, investor pressure, or strategic considerations. The company either files an SEC Form S-1 or makes an official announcement on their website about IPO plans before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The CEO's recent statement that 'it's dumb to IPO this year' is a strong signal against an imminent IPO announcement. With only 40 days remaining until the resolution date, the timeframe is extremely compressed for such a major strategic reversal. IPO planning typically involves months of preparation, regulatory filings, roadshows, and careful timing considerations. A company whose CEO has publicly dismissed the idea of going public this year is highly unlikely to announce IPO plans within weeks. The status quo strongly favors a No resolution - companies don't typically reverse major strategic communications on such short timescales without extraordinary circumstances. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of: (1) changed market conditions making IPO timing suddenly favorable, (2) significant investor pressure forcing the company's hand, (3) competitive dynamics requiring capital raising, or (4) any walking back of the CEO's statement. For my forecast to move lower (closer to 0%), I would need confirmation that the CEO's statement was very recent and emphatic, or reports of the company actively delaying IPO plans. The 8% probability accounts for the inherent uncertainty in corporate decision-making and the possibility of surprise announcements, but heavily weights the clear recent guidance from leadership and the short timeframe remaining.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
