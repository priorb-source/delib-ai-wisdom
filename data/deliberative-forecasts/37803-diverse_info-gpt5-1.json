    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the status-quo, policy, and timeline arguments I already weighted, but add two useful points: (1) historical precedent from the prior Trump administration where climate-related federal sites stayed down for extended periods; and (2) the June hearings are unlikely to produce binding directives in time. I’m cautious about Forecaster 3’s specific “Secretary Hegseth” claim, which may be inaccurate, but even without that, the broader policy direction is clear and consistent with continued downtime. Their emphasis on bureaucratic inertia and multi-year precedent nudges me slightly lower. I still see a non-trivial chance of a low-effort redirect to defuse criticism, but it’s outweighed by clear incentives to keep climate-branded assets offline.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~6 weeks, and climate.mil is currently down per the resolution source. The administration is actively dismantling climate-branded initiatives, lowering the incentive to restore even a placeholder. Historically, federal sites removed for political reasons tend to remain offline for long stretches absent explicit orders to restore. A pathway to Yes remains: to mitigate negative press around June oversight or to preserve link hygiene, DoD could stand up a 301/302 redirect or a generic landing page, which would register as “up.” That requires minimal technical work but does require a decision to tolerate the climate.mil branding, which current signals discourage. Given the policy direction, short timeline, and precedent, I reduce my estimate modestly. I would update up on any signs of DNS/hosting reactivation or a public commitment to restore/redirect; down on explicit decommissioning or continued silence into late June.",
