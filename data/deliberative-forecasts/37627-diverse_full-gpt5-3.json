    "review": "Both forecasters make solid cases anchored in the recent cadence of calls (Feb, Mar, May 10) and the generous 33-day window. Forecaster 2 adds a useful point that in-person attendance at Istanbul could substitute for a phone call, nudging probability down a bit; Forecaster 3 emphasizes that active negotiations typically require multiple leader-level touchpoints, which is persuasive. Neither dwells on two key risks I weight more: (1) the requirement that both sides acknowledge the call, which can fail even if a call occurs; and (2) ambiguity over multi-party calls (e.g., with European leaders) satisfying the “speak on the phone with each other” criterion if not explicitly framed and acknowledged as such by both sides. Still, their arguments strengthen the case that at least one additional acknowledged call is more likely than not within the window.",
    "rationale": "Evidence points to a high likelihood of another Trump–Zelenskyy call before June 15: the intense diplomacy around the proposed May 15 Istanbul talks, the EU’s 30-day ceasefire push, and prior behavior (roughly monthly calls with dual readouts) all raise the need for direct coordination. Even if Trump attends Istanbul in person, follow-up coordination later in May/early June remains plausible. Key failure modes are: (a) reliance on in-person or envoy channels only; (b) a call happens but only one side issues a readout; (c) communications occur via multi-party calls or video not clearly qualifying as a bilateral phone call under the resolution criteria; (d) a sudden diplomatic rupture reducing direct contact. Balancing these against the catalysts and recent pattern, I slightly raise my estimate. I remain a touch lower than the others due to the dual-acknowledgment and definitional risks.",
