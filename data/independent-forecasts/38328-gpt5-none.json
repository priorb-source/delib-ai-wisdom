    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Huawei-related lobbying story stalls without new revelations, and no MEP faces immediate pressure to step down; routine mid-term churn happens outside the June 9–30 window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Amid continued scrutiny from the Huawei lobbying investigation or unrelated personal/political reasons, at least one MEP publicly announces a resignation between June 9 and June 30, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: In a 720-member legislature, mid-term resignations do occur with some regularity for reasons including scandals, health, career moves to national posts, or legal issues. A rough hazard-rate view (1–2% annual resignation probability per member) implies an expected several resignations per year, translating to a material chance that any given multi-week window sees at least one resignation. That suggests a base probability in the ballpark of 40–55% for a roughly three-week window. Timing: The qualifying window is June 9–30, not the full month, which slightly lowers chances versus a full-month estimate. Scandal effect: The referenced late-May 2025 Huawei lobbying story plausibly increases near-term resignation risk if new facts emerge or party leadership pressures an implicated MEP. However, high-profile EP scandals (e.g., past cases) have not always produced swift resignations; legal processes and party calculations can slow or avoid immediate exits. Net: Weighing the broad-base turnover risk moderately upweighted by the ongoing scandal, but discounted by the narrower time window and the tendency for MEPs to resist rapid resignation, I place the probability at a moderate level below even odds. Why not higher: Many scandals do not culminate in fast resignations, and there is no concrete indication of imminent resignations timed specifically for late June. Why not lower: With 720 members, idiosyncratic exits (health, personal, appointments) plus scandal-driven pressure create a nontrivial chance that at least one resignation is announced within a three-week span. Potential updates: I would move higher on credible reports of (a) an MEP under active pressure to resign with timing hints in late June, (b) formal charges or party suspension escalating around mid/late June, or (c) unrelated national appointments requiring an MEP to vacate their seat in that window. I would move lower if investigations visibly cool, implicated MEPs publicly commit to stay pending inquiries, or institutional calendars/procedures make late-June resignations unlikely. Research assistant input: No additional information available, so the estimate relies on base rates, the given article’s existence (signaling elevated risk), and timing considerations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any members of the European Parliament resign before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nEuro News: [Lobbying scandal related to Huawei: What we know so far](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/05/21/lobbying-scandal-related-to-huawei-what-we-know-so-far)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the European Parliament announces their resignation after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
