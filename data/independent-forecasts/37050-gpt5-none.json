    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 67 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No company is removed from the DJIA before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "S&P Dow Jones Indices makes no composition changes; none of the 30 components undergo mergers, delistings, extreme crises, or stock-split-driven rebalancing that prompt a swap. Boeing stabilizes, and laggards like Verizon or 3M remain despite underperformance.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "S&P Dow Jones Indices announces a swap to better reflect the economy or sector balance (e.g., dropping a lagging constituent such as Verizon, 3M, or potentially Boeing, and adding a company like Alphabet or Meta). Alternatively, a Dow member is acquired or faces a severe, fast-moving crisis that triggers immediate removal.",
    "rationale": "Time left is short and the Dow changes infrequently. Over the last ~12 years, changes occurred in 2013, 2015, 2018, 2020 (three names), and 2024 (two names). That’s roughly five change events in 12 years, or ~0.4 events/year. Assuming changes can occur any time, a 2‑month window baseline is about 0.4*(2/12) ≈ 7%. Recent history also matters: the index was refreshed in February 2024 (Intel and Walgreens out; NVIDIA and Amazon in), which lowers the near-term need for further adjustment. The committee rarely telegraphs changes, and announcements typically come only a few days before effectiveness, so absent a clear trigger, status quo is favored.\nUpside risks: a credible report or official S&P DJI announcement of a reshuffle; a large, near-term corporate action (e.g., a major split of a high-priced component that distorts sector weights); a forced removal due to M&A; or an acute, headline crisis at a constituent (Boeing is the most obvious tail risk given operational and regulatory scrutiny). A desire to add Meta or Alphabet could push out a laggard (e.g., Verizon or 3M), but doing so within the next two months without a catalyst is still unlikely.\nDownside (toward No): each quiet week without a catalyst and absent leaks reduces the remaining hazard; the committee typically makes few changes and prefers stability.\nWhy not higher: Base rates over a short window are low; the index was just refreshed; there’s no widely signaled corporate action forcing a change. Why not lower: Non-zero probability of an opportunistic rebalancing, a sudden company-specific shock (most plausibly Boeing), or an unexpected M&A/spin announcement.\nResearch assistant summary: No additional information was provided, so this forecast relies on historical base rates, known 2024 changes, and general awareness of potential catalysts.\nI would update upward on: credible media reports of an imminent DJIA change; a significant new crisis or trading halt for a component; announcement of a large split or structural corporate action that shifts sector weights; or news of an acquisition of a component. I would update downward as time passes without such signals, especially into mid-to-late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
