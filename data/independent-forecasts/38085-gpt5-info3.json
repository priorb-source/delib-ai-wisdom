  "information": "The forecast period coincides with the start of Florida's typical rainy season on June 1, which is also the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a 60% chance of an above-average 2025 hurricane season, with 13-19 named tropical storms expected. This is attributed to factors like warmer ocean temperatures and low wind shear. However, a separate NOAA forecast from March 2025 also predicted that drought conditions in South Florida would likely persist from April through June.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (until June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Leaning Yes. Late April counts were ~14 million in drought, and absent a strong, early, and widespread rainy-season onset, similar levels could persist into late June.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Florida’s rainy season turns on robustly in early-to-mid June, with repeated, soaking sea-breeze storms and/or a weak tropical disturbance bringing several inches of rain to major population centers (especially the Miami–Fort Lauderdale–West Palm Beach corridor and the Tampa–Orlando corridor). The U.S. Drought Monitor downgrades these metros from D1+ to D0 or no drought by the June 25 map, pulling the statewide “people in drought (D1–D4)” below 14.0 million.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The rainy season onset is delayed or scattered, with continued deficits in South and Central Florida and no early-season tropical system delivering broad, soaking rains. D1+ persists across many populous counties (e.g., Southeast Florida and parts of the I‑4 corridor), keeping the Drought Monitor’s Florida “people in drought (D1–D4)” at or above 14.0 million on the June 25 update.",
    "rationale": "What I’m weighing:\n- Baseline/status quo: USA Today reported ~14 million Floridians in drought in late April, which aligns with drought.gov’s “people in drought (D1–D4)” metric. Given typical slow hydrologic recovery and that USDM changes lag multi-week rainfall, I put extra weight on persistence into late June.\n- Seasonality: Florida’s rainy season generally starts around June 1, which would normally reduce drought through June. But USDM often needs sustained, widespread rains over multiple weeks to shift D1/D2 to D0/none, especially where groundwater/streamflow deficits exist.\n- Outlooks: NOAA’s March seasonal outlook indicated drought is likely to persist in South Florida through April–June. That supports the idea that, by the end of June, much of South Florida may still be in D1+.\n- Hurricanes/tropics: NOAA expects an above‑average 2025 Atlantic season, but that mainly affects later summer. A June tropical system could rapidly improve conditions, but the odds of a Florida‑impacting, soaking June system are modest.\n\nWhy not higher: The rainy season could establish solidly over the next 2–3 weeks, and South Florida typically turns wet early; if the tri‑county SE Florida metro (~6M people) is downgraded out of D1+, the statewide count can quickly fall below 14M even if drought persists elsewhere. A single early tropical disturbance could accelerate that drop.\n\nWhy not lower: Recent levels were already around the threshold, and CPC/NOAA suggested persistence through June. Hydrologic recovery often lags even after the first few weeks of storms, and a delayed or patchy onset is plausible.\n\nWhat would move me down: (a) Next USDM update(s) show Florida “people in drought” <13M by mid‑June; (b) forecast confidence in a broad 3–6 inch rain event over SE/Central Florida in mid‑June; (c) reports of improving groundwater/streamflow metrics in South Florida.\n\nWhat would move me up: (a) Continued below‑normal rainfall through mid‑June; (b) expansion or persistence of D1–D2 in the Miami–Fort Lauderdale–West Palm Beach and/or I‑4 corridor; (c) lack of any organized tropical moisture episodes through late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe forecast period coincides with the start of Florida's typical rainy season on June 1, which is also the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
