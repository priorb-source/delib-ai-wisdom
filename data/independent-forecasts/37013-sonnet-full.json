  "information": "The composition of the Cornwall Council prior to the 2025 election consisted of 44 seats for the Conservatives, 13 for the Liberal Democrats, 4 for Labour, 1 for Reform UK, and 1 for the Greens, with the remainder held by others or independents. This represents a 31-seat lead for the Conservatives over the Liberal Democrats. Historically, the Liberal Democrats have never been the largest party on the Cornwall Council.\n\nNational polling data shows the Conservative party with a 22% approval rating, while Reform UK is polling at 25% and the Liberal Democrats at approximately 14-16%. In the 2024 UK general election, the Liberal Democrats regained the constituencies of North Cornwall and St Ives. Political analyst Professor John Curtice has noted that the surge in support for Reform UK is likely to split the right-wing vote, which could indirectly benefit the Liberal Democrats.\n\nFor the 2025 election, the Liberal Democrat party has launched a significant fundraising effort, including a £100,000 fund, and is fielding a near-full slate of candidates. An Electoral Calculus MRP poll has been cited in analyses of the election. On the Conservative side, several high-profile councillors announced their retirement, including the council leader Linda Taylor.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days. The 2025 Cornwall Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025 (first Thursday in May, following UK local election tradition).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - The Conservatives remain the largest party. They currently hold 44 seats compared to 13 for the Liberal Democrats, a 31-seat advantage. The Liberal Democrats have never been the largest party on Cornwall Council historically.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite national Conservative weakness, they retain enough seats to remain the largest party. While Reform UK splits some Conservative votes and the Liberal Democrats make gains, the 31-seat gap proves too large to overcome. Independents and other parties continue to hold significant seats, preventing any single party from dramatic gains. The Liberal Democrats increase their seat count but fall short of overtaking the Conservatives.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative vote collapses dramatically due to their 22% national approval rating. Reform UK's 25% polling splits the right-wing vote extensively, causing Conservatives to lose 20+ seats. The Liberal Democrats capitalize on their 2024 general election success in North Cornwall and St Ives, their well-funded campaign, and tactical voting to make historic gains. With multiple Conservative councillors retired including council leader Linda Taylor, organizational weakness compounds their losses, allowing the Liberal Democrats to become the largest party for the first time.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors No - the Liberal Democrats have never led Cornwall Council and trail by 31 seats. This is an enormous gap requiring a political earthquake to overcome. However, several unprecedented factors create uncertainty: (1) Conservative national approval at catastrophic 22%, (2) Reform UK at 25% creating significant vote-splitting potential, (3) Liberal Democrat momentum from winning North Cornwall and St Ives in 2024, (4) Conservative organizational weakness with leader retirement, (5) Liberal Democrat preparation with near-full candidate slate and £100k fundraising. Nevertheless, critical factors limit the probability: The 31-seat deficit is massive even in extraordinary circumstances. Local elections have different dynamics than parliamentary contests. The Liberal Democrats poll only 14-16% nationally, not particularly strong. Independents hold many seats, complicating the picture. Reform UK might win seats themselves rather than just splitting votes beneficially. Without Cornwall-specific polling showing a tied race, the status quo of Conservative dominance remains most likely. For a higher forecast, I'd need local polling showing Lib Dems competitive. For lower, evidence that vote-splitting isn't materializing locally. Given extreme national volatility but historical precedent and the mathematical challenge, assigning 18% probability.",
