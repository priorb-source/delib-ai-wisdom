    "review": "New arguments that mattered: (1) Recent “days-to-weeks” activation cadence after licensing in some African countries (Forecaster 3 citing DRC) suggests SpaceX can flip the map quickly once legal hurdles are cleared; I hadn’t anchored enough on this latest pace. (2) Emphasis on type approval, VAT/tax setup, and reseller enablement as the main remaining blockers rather than technical coverage (Forecaster 2). (3) Quarter-end optics incentive to show momentum before June 30.\nPoints I’m less convinced by: The enclave-in-SA logistics risk still exists, but given in-transit customs regimes and the fact that SA adjacency already enables gray imports from multiple licensed neighbors, I’m not sure Lesotho is uniquely constrained versus, say, Botswana/Zimbabwe launches. Also, map flips often align with orderability; shipping routes can be solved via air or authorized distributors.\nWhy I don’t go as high as 60–66: It’s been ~3 weeks post-license with no flip yet; Lesotho is small and may be lower priority; type approval and tax registration could add weeks; SpaceX sometimes leaves countries at Coming Soon post-license. The enclave factor could still create extra caution around spillover into South Africa.",
    "rationale": "Updated view: With ~54 days left, a license in hand, existing regional coverage, and SpaceX’s recent acceleration in Africa (e.g., DRC moving swiftly post-license), a flip to “Available” before July 1 is plausible and somewhat more likely than not. The key uncertainties are administrative: device type approvals, VAT/tax config, payments, and distribution. Lesotho’s small market and enclave status could slow prioritization, but they don’t look like hard blockers compared to places already launched nearby. End-of-quarter incentives (through June 30) nudge toward a batched availability update that could include Lesotho once compliance items clear.\nNet effect: I move up from 45% to 57%, giving more weight to the recent rapid post-license cadence and Q2 timing, while still discounting for small-market prioritization and remaining compliance steps.",
