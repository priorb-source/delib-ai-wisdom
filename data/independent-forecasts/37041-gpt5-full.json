  "information": "Colombia has declared a national health emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, there have been 79 reported cases and 36 deaths since 2024, with the departments of Tolima and Putumayo being the most affected. The government has implemented mobility restrictions in high-risk areas and vaccination requirements for travelers. In response to rising cases in South America, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued a level 2 travel notice for the continent, citing spread to newly affected areas in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.\n\nThe Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) issued an epidemiological alert in early April 2025 due to an increase in yellow fever cases in the Americas. In the first three months of 2025, 131 human cases and 53 deaths were confirmed in the region, primarily in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. This case count is more than double the total for all of 2024. Separately, the United Nations has warned that global aid funding cuts are disrupting child vaccination programs at a level similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to a rise in yellow fever cases after years of decline.\n\nSeveral countries near the outbreak zones have implemented preventive measures. Panama has activated health protocols, although it has not reported a human case since 1974 and has vaccination coverage of over 95% in high-risk areas. Ecuador has also activated protocols and is conducting preventive vaccination campaigns. Costa Rica has made the yellow fever vaccine mandatory for travelers arriving from 43 countries, including many in South America, as of March 11, 2025, due to the presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito vector in the country.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Yellow fever activity remains concentrated in South America (Brazil, Colombia, Peru). North American countries (e.g., Panama, Costa Rica, Mexico, Caribbean) report no local human cases or epizootics that would trigger a country-specific CDC Travel Health Notice. CDC maintains notices focused on South American countries or a general regional notice without creating any North America country-specific yellow fever notice.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A North American country—most plausibly Panama or Costa Rica—reports confirmed local human yellow fever cases or significant non-human primate epizootics near populated or border areas, prompting CDC to issue a country-specific Travel Health Notice (e.g., “Yellow Fever in Panama”) at Watch/Alert level by or shortly after June 1. Alternatively, CDC converts a regional ‘Americas’ advisory into country-specific notices that include at least one North American country.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: North America has had no recent yellow fever human cases; Panama’s last reported human case was in 1974. CDC typically issues country-specific Travel Health Notices when there is evidence of local transmission or a clear traveler risk within that country. As of late April 2025, the surge in cases is centered in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru (South America), consistent with PAHO’s alert. This points to a status quo of “No notice for a North American country.”\n- Evidence from assistant’s report: PAHO reports 131 human cases and 53 deaths in the Americas in Jan–Mar 2025, predominantly Brazil, Colombia, Peru; Colombia declared a national health emergency. CDC reportedly issued a Level 2 notice for the continent, citing spread in South America (Bolivia, Colombia, Peru). Several North American countries (Panama, Costa Rica) have activated protocols or tightened entry vaccination requirements, but these measures do not imply local transmission or a CDC country-specific THN.\n- Why not higher: The time window is short (~5.5 weeks); there is no current evidence of yellow fever circulation in North America; CDC generally does not issue country-specific THNs without local transmission signals. Historical absence of recent cases in North America and high vaccination coverage in high-risk Panamanian areas further reduce short-term odds.\n- Why not lower: Regional risk is elevated; Colombia’s outbreak includes areas nearer to the Darién. A single confirmed human case or notable epizootic in Panama or Costa Rica could trigger a Watch/Alert. Aedes aegypti is widespread in Central America and the Caribbean, and heavy cross-border movement through the Darién increases the chance of detection and precautionary actions.\n- Updaters to move higher: (1) PAHO or national ministries report suspected/confirmed local human cases or NHP die-offs in Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Mexico, or Caribbean islands; (2) CDC posts any yellow fever THN explicitly titled for a North American country; (3) PAHO/WHO escalates alerts specifically for Central America. \n- Updaters to move lower: (1) No spillover indicators in Central America by mid-May; (2) CDC clarifies/maintains THNs confined to South American countries; (3) Regional case counts plateau or decline.\nGiven the elevated South American activity but lack of North American transmission signals and the short timeline, a low but nonzero probability is warranted.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
