    "review": "Forecaster 2’s reasoning is broadly aligned with my initial view: GOP supermajorities and the fact that the question resolves upon bicameral passage (not gubernatorial signature) keep the path to Yes open despite a short runway. Forecaster 3 adds a new and important counter-signal I hadn’t factored in: in February 2025, stronger citizenship language was reportedly stripped from the transportation budget and replaced with a softer BMV-focused measure. If accurate, that indicates leadership hesitation about documentary proof-of-citizenship specifically, and suggests preference for administrative verification over placing new documentation burdens on voters—critical given the resolution requires voters to provide proof. Forecaster 3 also correctly emphasizes time constraints and lack of visible momentum on SB 153. I find this argument compelling and directionally bearish versus my prior 42%.",
    "rationale": "Key updates to my view: (1) The February removal of a stronger verification provision from a budget vehicle is a strong negative signal about intra-GOP appetite for documentary proof-of-citizenship in Ohio right now. (2) The question’s wording requires that voters be required to provide proof, which is narrower than generic data cross-checks or back-end verification; that narrows the set of policies that would qualify. (3) With ~8 weeks left, the operating budget is the main viable vehicle, but the February decision suggests leadership may avoid attaching this particular policy amid legal/political risk (NVRA litigation landscape) and administrative complexity. \n\nBalancing factors that still keep odds non-trivial: (a) GOP supermajorities can move quickly if leaders decide to; (b) the enactment criterion ignores a gubernatorial veto; (c) national GOP emphasis on noncitizen voting could spur late action or a budget-conference insertion. \n\nNet effect: I’m lowering my estimate from 42% to 30%. I would move up meaningfully if there are public signals from Senate/House leadership or the Secretary of State prioritizing documentary proof before June 30, if SB 153 receives rapid committee/floor action, or if draft budget language surfaces that requires any subset of voters (e.g., first-time registrants or mail voters) to provide documentary proof. I would move down if the House/Senate release budget drafts or conference reports without such language by mid-June, or if leadership explicitly indicates they’ll stick to administrative verification only.",
