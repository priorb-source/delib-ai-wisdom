    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The US Census Bureau typically releases its monthly U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services report around the first week of the month, two months after the reference month. The data for April 2025 is therefore expected in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo outcome is 'Yes'. The US economy generally experiences nominal growth year-over-year due to a combination of real economic growth and inflation. This trend suggests that the nominal value of imports in April 2025 would be higher than in April 2024.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A 'No' outcome would likely be caused by a significant economic downturn in the United States in early 2025. A recession would curb consumer and business demand for foreign goods, leading to a decrease in import volumes and overall value. Alternatively, the swift implementation of new, broad-based tariffs could also lead to a 'No' outcome if the resulting decrease in import quantity outweighs the increase in price.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A 'Yes' outcome occurs if the US economy continues to experience even modest acombination of real growth and inflation. Strong consumer spending and business investment, coupled with persistent, albeit moderating, inflation, would push the nominal dollar value of imports for April 2025 above the April 2024 threshold of $338.483 billion.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong tendency for nominal economic data to increase year-over-year. The threshold for a 'Yes' is very low, requiring only a marginal increase from the April 2024 figure of $338.483 billion. The two primary forces driving a 'Yes' outcome are baseline economic growth and inflation. Even in a scenario of zero real growth, persistent inflation, which was a feature of the economy leading into 2025, would likely be sufficient to increase the total nominal value of imports. For example, a 2% inflation rate applied to imports would comfortably push the value above the threshold, assuming import volumes did not significantly contract. The status quo, supported by economic forecasts from late 2024, was for the US economy to avoid a recession and continue with modest growth. \n\nMy forecast is not higher (e.g., 85-90%) because of two significant downside risks. First, the risk of a recession in the first half of 2025, potentially triggered by the lagged effects of prior monetary tightening, is substantial. An economic contraction would almost certainly lead to a decrease in imports. Second, the potential for a significant shift in trade policy, as alluded to in the background article, represents a major uncertainty. The imposition of large, across-the-board tariffs could disrupt trade flows and reduce overall import values, though the net effect in the short-term is complex. \n\nMy forecast is not lower (e.g., 50-60%) because the 'No' scenario requires a significant deviation from the baseline trend. Both a recession and a major trade shock are possibilities, but not the most probable path. The inertia of a multi-trillion dollar economy and the persistence of inflation provide a strong tailwind for a 'Yes' outcome. \n\nI would update my forecast higher if economic data for Q1 2025 (e.g., GDP, retail sales) came in stronger than expected. I would update lower if that same data pointed towards a contraction or if highly disruptive tariffs were implemented early in the year with immediate, observable impacts on trade.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US imports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of imports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 338,483 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
