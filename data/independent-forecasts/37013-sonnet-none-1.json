    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days. UK local elections typically occur on the first Thursday of May, which in 2025 would be May 1st. The outcome should be known by May 2nd, 2025 at the latest once votes are counted.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Liberal Democrats win the most seats. In the 2021 Cornwall Council election, the Liberal Democrats won 37 seats, making them the largest party ahead of Conservatives (32 seats) and Independents (18 seats) out of 87 total seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives recover from their recent national difficulties and perform strongly in Cornwall, winning back seats they lost in 2021. Alternatively, Independent candidates surge in popularity on local issues, fragmenting the vote and denying the Liberal Democrats their plurality. Labour or other parties could also make unexpected gains that reduce Liberal Democrat seat share below that of another party.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Liberal Democrats maintain their strong local presence in Cornwall, benefiting from effective local campaigning, the continuing national Conservative decline, and their track record running the council. They hold their existing seats and potentially make modest gains to retain their position as the largest party on the council.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Liberal Democrat plurality. They currently hold the most seats (37 out of 87) following the 2021 election. Good forecasting practice suggests putting substantial weight on the status quo since political landscapes typically change gradually rather than dramatically between election cycles. Cornwall has been trending toward the Liberal Democrats in recent years, with them becoming the dominant local force. Without specific evidence of major shifts in local sentiment or exceptional circumstances, the most likely outcome is that the Liberal Democrats retain their position. However, several factors prevent this from being a near-certainty: (1) Cornwall has a strong tradition of Independent candidates who can be unpredictable, (2) The 5-seat margin over Conservatives in 2021 wasn't overwhelming, (3) Local elections can be volatile with lower turnout amplifying swings, (4) Lack of recent polling data or constituency-level information. My forecast would be higher (85%+) if I had evidence of strong Liberal Democrat performance in recent by-elections or polls showing them extending their lead. It would be lower (50-60%) if there were reports of Conservative recovery, rising Independent movements, or local scandals affecting Liberal Democrats. The main uncertainty is the fragmented nature of Cornwall politics with its significant Independent presence.",
