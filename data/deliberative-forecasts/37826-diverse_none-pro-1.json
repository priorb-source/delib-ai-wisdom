    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis is unconvincing due to a critical factual error and questionable evidentiary standards. They incorrectly place the 2019 Balakot airstrike—the single most important precedent for a 'Yes' outcome—in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, when it was in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, one of the provinces specified in the resolution criteria. Furthermore, their 18% forecast is heavily anchored on the existence of a Wikipedia article, which is a weak and potentially unreliable signal for an ongoing conflict, especially when the official research assistant's report finds no additional information. Forecaster 3's analysis, by contrast, is very strong and corroborates my initial assessment. They correctly identify the Balakot precedent, appropriately weigh the low base rate of such attacks against the possibility of a triggering event, and mention the 2021 ceasefire agreement as a key factor maintaining the status quo. Their reasoning reinforces my confidence in my original forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. My initial reasoning stands: a kinetic attack by India inside Pakistan proper is a rare, high-stakes event primarily deterred by the risk of nuclear escalation. Such an action requires a significant provocation, like a mass-casualty terrorist attack, which has not occurred. The narrow one-month window of June 2025 further lowers the probability.\n\nI have deliberated on Forecaster 2's argument that a Wikipedia article titled '2025 India–Pakistan conflict' justifies a higher probability. I reject this argument. A Wikipedia page is not a reliable intelligence source; it can be speculative or user-generated without official basis. Given the research assistant's report of 'No additional information,' it is highly improbable that a major conflict is underway that is only documented on a Wikipedia page. I will not update my forecast based on this weak signal. Forecaster 2's analysis also contained a significant factual error regarding the location of the 2019 Balakot strike, which undermines their overall conclusion.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis reinforces my position. They correctly highlight the low base rate, the high bar for such an escalation, and the importance of the 2019 Balakot strike as the key precedent that prevents the probability from being near-zero. They also introduce the 2021 ceasefire understanding, which is an additional factor that favors the 'No' outcome and strengthens the case for the status quo holding. My 5% forecast continues to reflect the small but non-zero possibility of a sudden, severe provocation occurring within the specified time frame, leading to a retaliatory strike consistent with the Balakot precedent.",
