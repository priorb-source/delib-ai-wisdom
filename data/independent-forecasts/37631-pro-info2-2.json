  "information": "Recent company-specific developments include Tesla receiving a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) based on declining earnings estimate revisions. Its automotive division recorded its lowest profitability in five years in Q4 2024, with a 13.6% gross margin. The company plans to launch its Robotaxi in June 2025. For Walmart, its e-commerce segment is approaching profitability, with a projected 3-4% overall revenue growth. The company also announced plans to invest $6 billion in Mexico in 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, Walmart has a higher market capitalization than Tesla. This outcome reflects the current market conditions where Tesla's valuation has faced significant headwinds while Walmart's has remained stable and grown.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tesla's market cap surpasses Walmart's. This would likely be driven by a major positive catalyst, such as an overwhelmingly successful unveiling of its Robotaxi in June 2025, which reignites investor optimism and causes a sharp rally in Tesla's stock price.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Walmart's market cap remains higher than Tesla's. This scenario involves the continuation of current trends: Tesla continues to struggle with profitability, competition, and delivery targets, and its Robotaxi launch fails to generate enough positive momentum to overcome these challenges. Meanwhile, Walmart's stable growth and strong retail performance maintain its valuation.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong divergent trends between the two companies in the short term. The status quo, with Walmart currently ahead in market cap, is a powerful predictor given the resolution date is only 1.5 months away. The research provided indicates significant fundamental challenges for Tesla, including declining earnings estimates (Zacks Rank #5) and its lowest automotive profitability in five years. Conversely, Walmart is demonstrating stability and growth, particularly with its e-commerce segment nearing profitability. The primary variable that could alter this outcome is Tesla's planned Robotaxi launch in June 2025. This event is the main reason my probability is not higher; a highly successful launch could create significant positive sentiment and a rally in Tesla's volatile stock. However, given the broader negative sentiment and fundamental pressures, it's more likely that this single event will not be enough to close the valuation gap. My probability is not lower because the weight of the fundamental data and the current market trend strongly favor Walmart. For me to update my forecast towards 'No', I would need to see significant, credible hype and positive financial projections materializing around the Robotaxi launch. To update towards 'Yes', I would look for negative reports about the Robotaxi or further downward revisions of Tesla's delivery guidance.",
