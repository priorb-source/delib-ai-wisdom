    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days. The data for the week ending June 21, 2025, will be released on Thursday, June 26, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The status quo is a continuation of the recent trend of a gradually cooling labor market, with the 4-week moving average of initial claims hovering slightly above the 220,000 mark, making a weekly reading above this threshold more likely than not.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The labor market shows unexpected resilience for the specific week. This could be due to lower-than-anticipated seasonal layoffs or a lack of significant, idiosyncratic layoff events, causing the number to print at or below 220,000.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The gradual softening of the US labor market continues. Normal weekly volatility, layered on top of a baseline trend that is already near the threshold, is sufficient to push the number of initial claims for the week above 220,000.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the recent trend in initial jobless claims data. As of early June 2025, the US labor market continues its gradual cooling from the tight conditions of previous years. While the absolute level of claims remains historically low, the 4-week moving average, a more stable indicator, has drifted slightly upwards and is currently hovering in the 220,000-225,000 range. The question's threshold of 220,000 is therefore very close to the recent trend, making the outcome highly sensitive to normal weekly volatility. Since the trend is slightly above the line, the status quo points to a 'Yes' outcome. The research assistant provided no additional information, so my forecast relies on this public data trend.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the labor market is not showing signs of a sharp deterioration; rather, it is undergoing a slow moderation. A probability above 65-70% would require evidence of an accelerating downturn, which we do not currently have. \n\nMy forecast is not lower (i.e., below 50%) because that would imply a reversal of the recent upward drift in claims. Betting on a single week's volatile data to fall below a rising trend is the lower probability outcome. \n\nI would increase my probability for 'Yes' if the next two weekly reports before June 21 show a continued increase or a significant spike above 235,000. Conversely, I would lower my probability and potentially flip to 'No' if the upcoming reports show a decisive move downward, pushing the 4-week average back below 215,000.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 exceed 220,000?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer. The claim requests a determination of basic eligibility for the Unemployment Insurance program.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 is greater than 220,000 according to [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA).&#x20;\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
