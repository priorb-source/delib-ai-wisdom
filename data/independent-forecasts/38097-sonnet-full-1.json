  "information": "According to multiple news reports from late May 2025, former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo is considered disqualified from the 2025 presidential election. This is due to a 2018 conviction for the looting of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO), which resulted in a 20-year prison sentence and the loss of his civic rights. Sources such as Le Point, tunisienumerique.com, and Abidjan.net state that he remains struck from the electoral list. His political party, the People's African Party-Côte d'Ivoire (PPA-CI), announced in late April 2025 that it would evaluate the situation in the first half of June 2025 and consider a 'new level in the fight' if his status on the electoral list does not change.\n\nThe political climate in Côte d'Ivoire is marked by the disqualification of several opposition figures ahead of the October 2025 election. In April 2025, Tidjane Thiam, leader of the main opposition party PDCI-RDA, was disqualified after a court ruled he did not meet eligibility conditions due to his prior dual French-Ivorian nationality, despite having renounced his French citizenship. This and other exclusions have led to protests and accusations of electoral manipulation. Reports also mention that other political figures like Charles Blé Goudé and Guillaume Soro have been excluded from the electoral process due to judicial convictions. In response to the political tensions, various groups, including religious leaders and the UN, have called for peaceful dialogue.\n\nSeveral of the candidates named in the question have officially announced their intention to run in the 2025 presidential election. Jean-Louis Billon, a member of the PDCI-RDA party, announced his candidacy in late May 2025, positioning himself as an alternative within his party following the disqualification of its leader, Tidjane Thiam. Simone Gbagbo, former first lady, has also announced her candidacy under the banner of her party, the Movement of Capable Generations (MGC). Pascal Affi N'Guessan is also presented as a candidate for the FPI party.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month until July 1, 2025 (today is May 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - at least one candidate (Laurent Gbagbo) appears to already be disqualified",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "All five candidates remain legally eligible to run through July 1, 2025. This would require either: (1) current reporting about Laurent Gbagbo's disqualification being inaccurate, (2) a successful legal appeal reinstating him to the electoral list, or (3) all other candidates avoiding disqualification in the remaining month despite the contentious political environment",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Laurent Gbagbo remains disqualified as currently reported, OR any of the other four candidates (Gnangbo Kacou, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo) becomes disqualified in the next month before July 1, 2025",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report provides strong evidence that Laurent Gbagbo is already disqualified from the 2025 presidential election as of late May 2025. Multiple credible sources (Le Point, tunisienumerique.com, Abidjan.net) confirm he remains struck from the electoral list due to a 2018 conviction for looting the Central Bank of West African States, which resulted in a 20-year prison sentence and loss of civic rights. Since this disqualification status exists before July 1, 2025, it appears to satisfy the resolution criteria. The political context strongly supports this conclusion - Côte d'Ivoire is experiencing aggressive opposition disqualifications, with Tidjane Thiam (main opposition leader) disqualified in April 2025, and other figures like Charles Blé Goudé and Guillaume Soro also excluded. This demonstrates a pattern of judicial/electoral exclusions of opposition candidates. My forecast is not higher (not 95%+) because: (1) there's always some possibility the reporting is inaccurate or incomplete, (2) Laurent Gbagbo's party (PPA-CI) planned to 'evaluate the situation' in early June and consider a 'new level in the fight,' suggesting potential legal challenges, and (3) unexpected political/legal reversals could occur. My forecast is not lower because: (1) multiple independent sources confirm Gbagbo's disqualification, (2) the underlying legal basis (2018 conviction) appears solid, (3) only one of five candidates needs to be disqualified for a Yes resolution, and (4) the political environment shows authorities willing to disqualify opposition figures. For me to update higher: confirmation from additional authoritative sources or official electoral commission statements. To update lower: credible reporting of Gbagbo's reinstatement or evidence the disqualification reports were erroneous.",
