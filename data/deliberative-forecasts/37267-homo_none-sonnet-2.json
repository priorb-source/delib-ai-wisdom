    "review": "All three forecasts converge in the 8-15% range, suggesting strong agreement on the core analysis. The other forecasters raised several valuable points I hadn't explicitly articulated. Forecaster 3's observation that the State Department typically uses regional Level 4 designations within countries rather than country-wide Level 4 is particularly important - if security deteriorates in specific Ethiopian regions, the US would likely issue Level 4 for those areas while maintaining Level 3 for the country overall. This is a crucial distinction that makes a whole-country Level 4 even less likely. Forecaster 2's emphasis that Level 4 changes 'typically follow significant deterioration over time rather than sudden shifts' reinforces the temporal constraint. Forecaster 3's note about Addis Ababa's historical stability during regional conflicts is also relevant. However, none of the forecasters presented new evidence suggesting imminent crisis or deterioration that would substantially change my assessment. The narrow range of our forecasts (8-15%) indicates we're all calibrating similarly on what is fundamentally a low-probability event.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm making a modest upward adjustment to 10%. While I believe my original reasoning was sound, the convergence of forecasts around 10-15% suggests I may have been slightly overconfident at 8%. However, I'm staying at the lower end of this range because Forecaster 3's point about regional versus country-wide Level 4 designations is compelling and reinforces lower probability. The question specifically asks about Ethiopia receiving Level 4, not specific regions within Ethiopia. Given that: (1) Level 4 advisories for entire countries are exceptionally rare, (2) the 2-month timeframe is very short for such dramatic escalation, (3) the State Department would likely use regional Level 4 designations first if conditions deteriorated, and (4) there's no current evidence of imminent country-wide crisis, a 10% forecast appropriately reflects this as a low-probability but not impossible event. The mention of new travel warnings suggests ongoing monitoring but not imminent Level 4 escalation.",
