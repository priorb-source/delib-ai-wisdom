  "information": "As of mid-to-late May 2025, New York Yankees player Aaron Judge had a batting average at or above .400. Reports from May 20th list his average as .401, while other reports from the preceding week cited it as high as .410 and .423. Through his first 46 games, he had a batting average of 0.401. His Batting Average on Balls in Play (BABIP) was .481, compared to his career average of .344. Statcast data calculated his expected batting average (xBA) at approximately .362.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "42 days (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - Aaron Judge currently has a .401 batting average",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Judge's batting average regresses toward his expected batting average of .362 as his BABIP normalizes from the unsustainably high .481 to something closer to his career .344 average. Over the next 30-40 games before July 1, mean reversion pulls his average below .400, and no other player reaches that threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Judge maintains elite performance despite statistical indicators suggesting regression, keeping his average at or above .400 through July 1. His buffer of .001 above the threshold proves sufficient even with some decline. Alternatively, another player could surge to reach .400 by that date.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors YES since Judge currently sits at .401. However, several statistical red flags suggest this is unsustainable: (1) His BABIP of .481 is 137 points above his career .344, indicating significant luck; (2) His expected batting average of .362 based on contact quality is 39 points below his actual .401; (3) Historical precedent shows .400 averages are extremely rare and typically decline as sample size increases. With approximately 30-40 games remaining before July 1, there is substantial opportunity for regression to the mean. That said, Judge is an elite player with only a .001 buffer needed, and 42 days is short enough that he might not fully regress to expected levels. The key tension is between the current reality (he IS at .400+) and statistical indicators (suggesting strong regression coming). I'm weighing the status quo moderately but accounting heavily for the clear signals of mean reversion. My forecast would increase if Judge's xBA were closer to his actual BA or if his BABIP were more sustainable. It would decrease if we had more time until resolution or if Judge showed signs of injury/slump.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any major league baseball player have a .400 batting average on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\ntheScore: [How long can Judge's .400 batting average last?](https://www.thescore.com/mlb/news/3284701/how-long-can-judges-400-batting-average-last)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
