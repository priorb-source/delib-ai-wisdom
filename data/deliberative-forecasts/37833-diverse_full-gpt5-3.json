    "review": "Forecaster 2’s main divergence is treating April 1 as the operative cutoff, which conflicts with the stated resolution criteria (posts before July 1, 2025, checked on/after July 1). That said, their core points—Trump’s near-absence from X, Musk’s focus shift away from U.S. politics, and the strict exact-phrase requirement—are all strong, and they push the odds down. Forecaster 3 aligns with the July 1 window and highlights the same structural headwinds, but I find their 20% high given the specificity of the phrase and platform habits. Neither adds decisive new positive evidence (e.g., a contemporaneous DV news cycle) that would raise the odds; if anything, they reinforce that both principals are unlikely to produce a qualifying post. One additional nuance worth emphasizing: the X search will not count the text of a quoted post as authored text, so Musk would have to type “diversity visa” explicitly, further lowering odds.",
    "rationale": "I initially put this at 13% on the strength of a non-zero chance that a late-breaking immigration discussion (e.g., contrasts with a “Gold Card” or H‑1B talk) could prompt an explicit mention, plus Musk’s habit of engaging opportunistically. The deliberation reinforced the key dampeners: Trump’s practical non-use of X, Musk’s reduced political posting, and the exact-phrase requirement. The “account Musk follows” signal is weak unless he explicitly types the phrase. With ~40 days left (to July 1), the base rate for either to use that specific bureaucratic term on X looks very low. I’m moving down to reflect these structural headwinds, while retaining a small tail for a catalyzing news cycle or an impulsive Musk reply that uses the exact words.",
