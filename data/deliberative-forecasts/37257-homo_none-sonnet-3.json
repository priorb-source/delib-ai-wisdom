    "review": "All three forecasters show strong agreement on the core analytical framework, placing probabilities in a narrow 12-18% range. We all identified the same critical factors: Dodik's long-standing pattern of referendum threats without actual scheduling, the short 2-month timeframe, lack of current signals, strong international opposition, and the relatively low resolution bar (announcement only, not implementation). Forecaster 2 independently arrived at exactly 12% using nearly identical reasoning to mine, which provides validation. Forecaster 3's higher 18% forecast appears to weight regional volatility and surprise potential slightly more heavily, but doesn't introduce substantially new evidence or arguments. The convergence around 12-15% central estimate across all forecasters is reassuring. The most significant shared insight is that the absence of any indication from the research assistant about imminent announcements is particularly important given only 2 months remain - if serious plans existed, some signals would likely be visible. All three of us appropriately noted that while the probability isn't negligible due to regional tensions and political unpredictability, the strong status quo pattern and constrained timeframe make the base case clearly favor NO.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, I find strong convergence on the key factors and no compelling new evidence that would warrant updating my forecast. Forecaster 2's independent arrival at 12% using parallel reasoning reinforces my confidence in this estimate. Forecaster 3's slightly higher 18% represents a reasonable alternative weighting but doesn't reflect new information. The critical factors remain: (1) Dodik's multi-year pattern of threats without scheduling action, (2) only 2 months remaining with no current signals, (3) substantial international disincentives, (4) research assistant's lack of findings suggesting imminent moves. While I acknowledge Forecaster 3's point about volatility allowing for surprises, the absence of preparation indicators this close to the deadline is highly informative. If referendum scheduling were imminent, we would expect to see preparatory rhetoric, institutional signals, or escalating tensions. The base rate for such announcements remains very low, and the burden of evidence needed to overcome that prior hasn't been met. The 12% forecast appropriately balances the genuine but limited possibility of a surprise announcement against the strong status quo bias.",
