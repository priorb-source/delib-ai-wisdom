  "information": "The Trump administration has threatened to revoke Harvard University's 501(c)(3) status, citing the university's DEI programs, alleged anti-Semitism, and refusal to comply with demands for reforms to governance and leadership. The administration has frozen $2.2 billion in federal funding and $60 million in contracts intended for the university. In response, Harvard has filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing that its actions are arbitrary, capricious, and outside the scope of its legal authority. The university has rejected the administration's demands, with its spokesperson stating there is 'no legal basis for revoking the University's exemption.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 67 days from April 25, 2025 to July 1, 2025 (about 2 months)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Harvard retains its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status, as it currently has this status and absent successful administrative action to revoke it, the status would continue",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The IRS does not complete revocation proceedings within the timeframe, or Harvard's lawsuit results in a court injunction blocking the revocation. The administrative process takes longer than 67 days due to required procedures including notification, response periods, and administrative review. The legal basis for revocation proves insufficient under 501(c)(3) statutory requirements.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The IRS rapidly initiates and completes revocation proceedings within 67 days, successfully arguing that Harvard violated 501(c)(3) requirements. The administration overcomes or bypasses Harvard's legal challenges, and courts either decline to issue injunctions or rule quickly in the government's favor, allowing the revocation to take effect before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Multiple factors strongly favor the status quo outcome. First, the timeframe is exceptionally short - only 67 days for a complex administrative and legal process that typically takes months or years. Revoking 501(c)(3) status requires following established IRS procedures including notification, response opportunities, and administrative review. Second, Harvard has already filed a lawsuit arguing the actions are arbitrary and lack legal basis. Courts routinely issue injunctions in such cases, which would prevent revocation during litigation. Third, the legal merit appears questionable - 501(c)(3) revocation requires demonstrating violations of specific statutory requirements under the Internal Revenue Code. The cited reasons (DEI programs, alleged anti-Semitism) would need to be framed as violations of exempt purpose requirements or prohibited political activities, which is a high legal bar. Fourth, there is virtually no precedent for major research universities losing tax-exempt status, especially on this timeframe. The research assistant's report confirms Harvard's position that there is 'no legal basis' for revocation, and the university has rejected the administration's demands. While the Trump administration has demonstrated willingness to take aggressive actions (freezing $2.2 billion in funding), and political pressure exists, the combination of legal barriers, procedural requirements, active litigation, and the extremely compressed timeline make actual revocation before July 1 highly unlikely. My forecast is not lower (1-2%) because: there is stated political intent, funding has been frozen showing follow-through, and theoretically expedited procedures could be attempted. My forecast is not higher (8-10%+) because: the 67-day window is extraordinarily short for this type of action, the legal basis appears weak, Harvard is actively litigating, and historical precedent strongly favors the status quo. I would update upward if the IRS formally initiates revocation proceedings or courts deny Harvard's injunction requests. I would update downward if courts grant injunctions or more time passes without concrete IRS action.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
