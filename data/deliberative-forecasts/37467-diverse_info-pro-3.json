    "review": "The other two forecasters provided compelling, evidence-based arguments that have convinced me to significantly revise my forecast. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasized that the extremely short 54-day timeframe is the dominant factor and that typical public signals of imminent bankruptcy are absent. Forecaster 3 provided the most critical new information, which was a game-changer for my analysis: the existence of a new $100M senior secured facility with PIK interest and a cash balance of ~$116M as of March 2025. This specific liquidity data provides a much stronger foundation for a low-probability forecast than my initial analysis, which was based more on inferring liquidity burn from operational losses.",
    "rationale": "I am substantially lowering my forecast from 20% to 8%. My initial forecast was heavily influenced by the alarming Q1 operational results, particularly the negative gross margin, which I interpreted as a signal of unsustainable cash burn that could lead to a near-term liquidity crisis. However, the information presented by the other forecasters, especially Forecaster 3, reveals that Beyond Meat has taken concrete steps to shore up its short-term liquidity. With ~$116M in cash and a new $100M facility that conserves cash via PIK interest, the company has secured a runway that almost certainly extends well beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline. The immediate risk is not cash exhaustion but a less probable event, such as a breach of a covenant on the new debt. The long-term outlook remains dire, as evidenced by its bonds trading at 17 cents on the dollar, but the new financing makes a bankruptcy filing in the next 54 days highly unlikely. I am therefore aligning with the 8% probability, which appropriately reflects the company's strong short-term liquidity buffer while still accounting for a small, non-zero tail risk of an unforeseen event.",
