    "review": "The other forecasters have correctly identified the historical context of this question, centering their arguments on the strong force of bureaucratic inertia. Their reasoning—that a decades-old, harmless error is unlikely to be fixed—is compelling in principle. However, their analyses are critically flawed as they are based on an outdated premise. Both forecasters appear to have relied on the 2020 AP article without verifying the current status of the tariff in the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). My initial forecast reached the correct conclusion but through a flawed, incomplete process. The other forecasters' analysis, while factually incorrect about the current situation, productively forced me to conduct a more rigorous search and uncovered the definitive evidence that resolves the discrepancy.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 1% was directionally correct but based on an incomplete search of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). After reviewing the other forecasts, which correctly identified the historical existence of the tariff, I conducted a more thorough investigation. \n\nThe central fact is that the situation described in the 2020 AP article has changed. The specific 50% tariff on certain furskins from Lesotho existed under HTS heading 9903.40.05, which was activated by U.S. note 3(e) to subchapter III of chapter 99. However, this was officially corrected. Presidential Proclamation 10414, issued on June 27, 2022, explicitly deleted both the activating note and the tariff heading. \n\nTherefore, this 50% tariff has not been in effect for nearly three years. The current HTS, the primary source for this question's resolution, does not contain this provision. The status quo is a 'No' outcome. For the outcome to be 'Yes' on June 1, 2025, the U.S. government would have to actively and specifically re-introduce this exact tariff within the next month. There is no political or economic impetus for such an action. \n\nMy forecast remains at 1%, but my confidence in it has increased substantially. The conclusion is no longer based on a failure to find the tariff, but on definitive proof of its removal. The small 1% probability is maintained to account for the infinitesimally small chance of a new, contrary clerical error or an unforeseen and abrupt policy change.",
