    "review": "Forecaster 2’s analysis is useful for the conditional comparison (Carney vs. Trump if Carney is PM), noting Trump’s historically stable 40–45% band and the possibility of a honeymoon bump for a new PM. But it effectively assumes away the crucial precondition: Carney is not currently PM, and without that, Morning Consult won’t list him, so the question resolves No. A 45% headline probability substantially overweights the conditional comparison while underweighting the very low odds of Carney being PM by the time Metaculus checks.\n\nForecaster 3 focuses on the key hinge — Carney becoming PM in time — and I largely agree with their framing and low base rate. The only nuance I’d add is that the resolution says “on or after July 1,” so if Metaculus checks later in July, there is slightly more time than exactly 6.5 weeks. That said, in practice Metaculus often resolves near the target date, so this doesn’t move the needle much.\n",
    "rationale": "Time until check: approximately 6+ weeks to July 1, with a small chance Metaculus checks later in July.\nStatus quo: Trudeau remains PM; Morning Consult lists Trudeau, not Carney; question resolves No.\nNo scenario: No leadership change (most likely), or Carney not installed/recognized by Morning Consult at time of check, or Carney’s initial approval ≤ Trump’s (including tie).\nYes scenario: Rapid Trudeau resignation plus swift coalescence around Carney as PM (despite him not currently being an MP), Morning Consult promptly lists him, and his honeymoon approval exceeds Trump’s (plausible if it happens).\nReasoning: Canadian leadership transitions typically take months; installing Carney before Metaculus checks would require unusually fast, coordinated action by the Liberal Party and the Governor General. Even allowing for rare, sudden transitions, the probability is low. Conditional on Carney being PM at the time of check, I’d put P(Carney approval > Trump) at roughly 60–70% due to likely honeymoon effects versus Trump’s stable low-40s band. Multiplying by a small probability (low single digits) that Carney is PM at the check yields a low overall chance. The “on or after” wording marginally increases the window but not enough to change the bottom line materially.\n",
