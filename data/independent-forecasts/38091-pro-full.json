  "information": "In the first five months of 2025, three countries signed the Artemis Accords: Finland (January 23), Bangladesh (April 8), and Norway (May 15), bringing the total number of signatories to 55. This follows the signings of Panama and Austria in December 2024. In a statement on May 22, 2025, acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro said that NASA anticipates additional countries will sign the accords in the coming weeks and months.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates hosted an international Artemis Accords workshop in Abu Dhabi on May 21-22, 2025. Representatives from over 30 of the 55 signatory countries attended to discuss the implementation of the Accords' principles, including transparency, data sharing, and sustainability in space. In addition, the 2025 Humans to the Moon & Mars Summit (H2M2) was held in Washington, D.C., on May 28-29, bringing together leaders from government, industry, and international space agencies to discuss the future of human space exploration.\n\nAs of late May 2025, there have been no public announcements of a specific country planning to sign the Artemis Accords during the month of June. In a parallel development in international space exploration, China and Russia have announced a joint plan to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2035 to power their International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). The ILRS project is positioned as a rival to the US-led Artemis program and has secured partnerships with 17 countries.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month. The outcome will be known on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No country signs the Artemis Accords between May 30, 2025 and July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The month of June 2025 passes without any new country formally signing the Artemis Accords. Diplomatic discussions may continue with potential signatories, but no final agreement is concluded and signed within the specified one-month window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following recent diplomatic engagements and international space conferences, a country completes its internal review process and officially signs the Artemis Accords in a ceremony or via diplomatic channels during June 2025.",
    "rationale": "The forecast of 55% reflects a slightly better than even chance that a country will sign the accords in June. This is based on strong positive momentum and explicit statements from NASA leadership. \n\nSupporting a 'Yes' outcome: \n1.  **Rate of Signatories:** Three countries have already signed in the first five months of 2025 (Finland, Bangladesh, Norway), indicating a consistent pace of about one signatory every 1.5-2 months. This base rate suggests a signing in any given month is plausible.\n2.  **Official Statements:** Acting NASA Administrator Janet Petro's statement on May 22, 2025, that NASA anticipates more signatories in the \"coming weeks and months\" is a significant piece of evidence. June falls squarely within the \"coming weeks,\" suggesting signings are actively being prepared.\n3.  **Diplomatic Momentum:** Recent international forums, such as the workshop in the UAE and the H2M2 Summit in Washington D.C., provide opportunities to finalize agreements with prospective signatories.\n\nSupporting a 'No' outcome:\n1.  **Unpredictable Timing:** The precise timing of diplomatic agreements is inherently uncertain. While the trend is positive, there's no guarantee a signing will fall within the specific 30-day window of June. Negotiations can be delayed for numerous administrative or political reasons.\n2.  **Lack of Public Confirmation:** As of late May, there are no public announcements or strong rumors about a specific country being scheduled to sign in June. Such events, while sometimes unannounced, often have some public lead-up.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the outcome is constrained to a narrow one-month window. Even if a signing is imminent, a slight delay could push it into July, resolving this question as 'No'. My probability is not lower because the momentum and, most importantly, the forward-looking statement from NASA's leadership provide strong signals that the pipeline of new signatories is active and likely to produce results soon. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there were official announcements of bilateral meetings between the U.S. and a prospective signatory, or if credible news reports identified a country nearing a decision. I would decrease my forecast if the first half of June passes with no announcements, or if key diplomatic figures signal a focus on other priorities.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025. There are 55 signatories at the time of this question: Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
