    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days from today (May 6) until July 1, 2025, with the resolution window being May 12 - June 30 (approximately 50 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the USD remains above 0.80 EUR throughout the resolution period",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Markets stabilize after recent tariff-related volatility. The dollar finds support as tariff concerns ease, the Federal Reserve maintains credible monetary policy, or relative economic conditions between the US and Eurozone prevent further significant dollar depreciation. The USD remains in the 0.83-0.92 EUR range without breaking the 0.80 threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The tariff turmoil escalates significantly, triggering a broader trade war or economic crisis. This could be accompanied by aggressive Federal Reserve policy changes, deteriorating US fiscal conditions, or major geopolitical shocks that cause investors to flee the dollar. The combination drives sustained selling pressure that pushes USD below 0.80 EUR at some point during the resolution window.",
    "rationale": "The background indicates the dollar recently hit a 3-year low amid tariff turmoil, suggesting current rates are already weak (likely around 0.87-0.92 EUR per USD based on historical context). For the question to resolve Yes, we need the dollar to depreciate an additional 7-12% from these already-depressed levels within approximately 7 weeks. While currency volatility is elevated due to tariff concerns, such a large additional move in a short timeframe would require either: (1) a major escalation of current trade tensions, (2) a significant economic crisis, or (3) dramatic policy shifts. Currency markets typically exhibit mean reversion after sharp moves unless fundamental conditions continue deteriorating. The 0.80 level represents a psychological barrier and would mark an extreme low not seen in many years. Good forecasting practice suggests putting substantial weight on status quo continuation - most of the time, even volatile markets don't make extreme moves. The fact that we're already at 3-year lows might actually suggest less room to fall rather than more, as some negative news is priced in. However, the elevated volatility and ongoing tariff uncertainty do create meaningful tail risk. My forecast is not higher because: reaching 0.80 requires substantial further depreciation beyond already-weak levels in a short window, extreme moves are statistically rare, and markets may stabilize. My forecast is not lower because: volatility is clearly elevated, tariff situations can escalate unpredictably, and we only need to touch 0.80 briefly at any point in the window. I would revise upward if: tariffs escalate dramatically, US economic data significantly disappoints, or we see the rate approach 0.82-0.83 in early May. I would revise downward if: tariff tensions clearly de-escalate or the dollar shows strength in coming days.",
