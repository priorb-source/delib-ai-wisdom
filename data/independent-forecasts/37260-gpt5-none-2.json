    "no_outcome_scenario": "No competent authority announces a ban by July 1, 2025. Either no party-ban application is filed, or it is filed but the Federal Constitutional Court has not ruled yet (or declines to ban).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An application to ban AfD is filed immediately and the Federal Constitutional Court takes it up and issues an unprecedented, extremely fast, final ruling announcing a ban before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Banning a political party in Germany can only be done by the Federal Constitutional Court under Article 21 of the Basic Law, upon application by the Bundestag, Bundesrat, or Federal Government. Even in comparatively simpler cases (e.g., NPD), proceedings took years (2001–2003; 2013–2017). The legal threshold is high: the party must not only be anti-constitutional in aims but also possess a concrete potential to undermine the free democratic basic order. AfD is a major party with significant representation; any ban would be legally and politically momentous and procedurally extensive. The reported Bundestag debate (Jan 31, 2025) about bringing proceedings signals political momentum but does not initiate, let alone conclude, a ban. With roughly two months to the deadline, a full evidentiary process and final judgment before July 1 is effectively impossible. The question’s resolution criteria require an official announcement of a ban by a competent authority (in practice, the Constitutional Court). No other German government entity can validly announce a party ban. Research assistant provided no additional recent developments to suggest filings, expedited scheduling, or imminent rulings. Why not higher: the timeline and legal bar make a pre-July 1 ban extraordinarily unlikely; prior precedent indicates multi-year timelines. Why not lower: allow a small tail risk for unexpected procedural or political shocks (e.g., a catastrophic revelation prompting an emergency, Court fast-tracking in an unprecedented way). What would move me up: immediate filing by key applicants, formal docketing by the Court with explicit accelerated timetable, compelling new evidence indicating an imminent threat, and signaling from the Court that it intends to revisit or relax the “potentiality” threshold. What would move me down: clear statements that no application will be filed this spring, or confirmation that the Court has no such case on its docket or that any filing will follow a standard, lengthy schedule.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Germany ban the AfD before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nLe Monde: [Germany's Bundestag debates banning far-right AfD party](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/01/31/germany-s-bundestag-debates-banning-far-right-afd-party_6737637_4.html) \"A cross-party group of 124 MPs put a motion on the agenda to bring proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the party, whose unprecedented alliance with the CDU caused a shock.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is an official announcement of a ban on the Alternative for Germany (AfD) by a German government entity with the authority to make such an announcement (e.g., the Federal Constitutional Court).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
