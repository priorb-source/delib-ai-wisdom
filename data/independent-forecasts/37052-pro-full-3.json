  "information": "In Africa, a coup attempt in Burkina Faso was reportedly foiled on April 16, 2025, leading to the arrest of several army officers. This follows a January 2025 attack on the presidential palace in Chad, which was also viewed as a potential coup attempt. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has expressed concern over a wave of unconstitutional changes in West Africa, noting that between August 2020 and August 2024, the region experienced nine coup attempts, four of which were successful. Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso have withdrawn from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to form their own 'Sahel Alliance.' According to a report by Amnesty International, since the July 2023 coup in Niger, there has been a sharp escalation of human rights violations, including arbitrary detentions and violations of press freedom.\n\nAccording to the University of Illinois Cline Center’s Coup d'État Project, the number of coups, attempts, and conspiracies has risen since 2021 to 14-16 events per year, compared to single-digit figures in the 2000s and 2010s. However, these figures remain below the averages of the 1960s and 1970s. The number of successful coups was seven in 2021 and five in 2024. A summary of historical data from the reports indicates that from 2020 to early 2025, Africa experienced nine notable coup events, of which seven were successful. Over a similar period, from 2022 to 2024, Latin America had three notable coup events, all of which were unsuccessful.\n\nIn Latin America, the Venezuelan government has offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of opposition leader Edmundo González, accusing him of inciting a coup following a disputed election in 2024. In Brazil, former President Jair Bolsonaro is reportedly preparing to present legal arguments to defend himself against accusations of leading a coup plot. The World Bank has revised its economic growth projections for Latin America downward to 2.1% for 2025. According to the agents' analysis, there have been no reported coup attempts in Latin America so far in 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two months, as the question deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No successful coup occurs in either Africa or Latin America within the specified timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing political instability and potential coup attempts in volatile regions like the Sahel, no group succeeds in overthrowing an existing government and consolidating power before the July 1, 2025 deadline. Any attempts that do occur are thwarted by loyalist security forces or fail to gain sufficient traction to be deemed 'successful'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Military leaders in a politically unstable African nation, such as Chad or another country in the 'coup belt', seize control of the capital, detain the president, and declare a transitional government. They successfully neutralize any resistance from loyalist forces and establish effective control over the state apparatus, which is then reported by credible international media.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an elevated base rate of successful coups in recent years, concentrated almost entirely in Africa. The risk in Latin America is negligible, as recent attempts have consistently failed. According to the provided data, Africa has seen approximately seven successful coups since 2020, with a notable increase in frequency since 2021. The annual rate of successful coups in the specified regions was as high as five in 2024. Calculating a probability using a Poisson distribution based on a conservative rate of 3-4 successful coups per year in the region yields a probability of 40-50% for a period of this length (approx. 66 days). The recent failed attempts in Burkina Faso (April 2025) and Chad (January 2025) confirm that the conditions for coups are ripe and plots are actively underway. The formation of the 'Sahel Alliance' and the weakening of regional bodies like ECOWAS have created a permissive environment for unconstitutional power grabs. \n\nMy probability is not higher (e.g., >50%) because a successful coup is still a high-impact, relatively infrequent event, and the timeframe of just over two months is short. Even in a high-risk environment, it is statistically more likely than not that such an event will not fall within this specific, narrow window. My probability is not lower (e.g., <25%) because that would ignore the clear and dramatic increase in the frequency of successful coups over the last four years compared to the previous decade. The current geopolitical climate, particularly in the Sahel, is significantly more volatile than the longer-term average would suggest. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of a head of state being detained or major, unexplained military movements in the capital of a vulnerable nation. I would decrease it with the peaceful passing of time, especially after mid-June, without significant new incidents of instability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to [Powell & Thyne (2011, p. 252)](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf), a coup is \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\" In recent years, some of the coups in Africa have been:&#x20;\n\n* [Mali August 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Mali May 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Niger March 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Nigerien_coup_attempt) (attempt)\n* [Niger July 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nigerien_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Gabon August 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Gabonese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Chad January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%27Djamena_attack) (possible attempt)\n* [Burkina Faso January 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Burkina Faso September 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)&#x20;\n* [Guinea September 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n\nLatin America has had the following coup attempts in recent years:\n\n* [Peru self-coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Peruvian_self-coup_attempt), December 2022\n* [Brazil Congress attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack), January 2023\n* [Bolivia coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bolivian_coup_attempt), June 2024\n\nSee also: [VoA by the numbers Coups in Africa](https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is a successful coup d’état in any country on the African continent or Latin America before July 1, 2025, according to credible media reports.

This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Africa, a coup attempt in Burkina Faso was reportedly foiled on April 16, 2025, leading to the arrest of several army officers.
