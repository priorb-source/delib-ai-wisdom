  "information": "In late May 2025, following a major Russian drone and missile attack in Ukraine, President Donald Trump referred to President Vladimir Putin as 'absolutely crazy.' In a separate statement, Trump also expressed his disappointment with Putin's continued attacks, saying, 'I am very disappointed, very, very disappointed.' Trump indicated he would observe Russia's intentions over a two-week period to determine if they were genuine about achieving peace.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "One month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Given the current strained relations and the short timeframe, the default outcome is that no visit will be planned or executed before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "President Trump's two-week observation period passes with no significant de-escalation from Russia in Ukraine. Diplomatic relations remain cold, and the logistical and political barriers to a presidential visit are not overcome. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without a visit occurring.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a dramatic and unexpected move, Russia announces a major ceasefire and partial troop withdrawal in Ukraine within the next two weeks. Seizing the opportunity for a historic diplomatic victory, President Trump agrees to a hastily arranged summit in Russia in late June to personally broker a peace deal.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the 'No' outcome, primarily due to the current status quo. The research provided indicates a significant downturn in rhetoric, with President Trump calling President Putin 'absolutely crazy' and expressing severe disappointment. This establishes a diplomatic environment highly unconducive to a friendly presidential visit. Organizing such a high-stakes visit to an adversarial nation during a major conflict typically requires months of careful diplomatic groundwork, which has clearly not taken place and cannot be accomplished in the one-month timeframe remaining. The political risks for President Trump, both domestically and with international allies, would be immense unless the visit yielded a spectacular and unambiguous success, such as a definitive end to the war in Ukraine. The probability of Russia making the necessary concessions within Trump's stated two-week observation window is extremely low. My probability is not zero because President Trump has a documented history of engaging in unconventional, personal diplomacy and could be tempted by the prospect of a dramatic peacemaking gesture. His 'two-week' ultimatum, while likely posturing, creates a conditional, albeit tiny, pathway to a 'Yes' outcome. I would significantly raise my forecast if credible reports emerged of a major Russian de-escalation in Ukraine coupled with evidence of high-level back-channel talks. Conversely, if the two-week period passes with continued Russian aggression, my forecast would move even closer to zero.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit Russia before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits Russia.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn late May 2025, following a major Russian drone and missile attack in Ukraine, President Donald Trump referred to President Vladimir Putin as 'absolutely crazy.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
