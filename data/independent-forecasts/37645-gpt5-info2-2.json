  "information": "In response to protests, government officials have maintained that there is no need for early elections. Vice-Premier Ivica Dačić stated that the ruling coalition has a 'stable majority' in parliament. Following the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, President Aleksandar Vučić announced that a decision would be made within ten days on whether to form a new government or hold elections. More recently, a May 14, 2025 article quoted Vučić saying the party would again decide 'within ten days' whether to form another new cabinet or go to the polls.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no specific election date is announced by July 1, 2025, and a new cabinet is formed instead.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "SNS-led coalition names a PM-designate within days, assembles a cabinet with existing partners (who say they have a stable majority), and continues governing; no decree is issued setting an election date before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Vučić decides to seek a renewed mandate, dissolves the assembly, and officially sets a specific election date (likely for late summer or early autumn) before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Context and timeline: The PM resigned in January 2025. Vučić has repeatedly said a decision is imminent on forming a new government vs. going to elections, most recently on May 14 (“within ten days”). There are ~46 days left to make an official announcement with a specific date, which is procedurally feasible (Serbia typically uses a ~45-day campaign period, and the date can be set well ahead of an autumn vote).\n- Status quo bias: Governments usually avoid snap polls when they have a comfortable majority. Coalition figures (e.g., Ivica Dačić) publicly say there is no need for early elections and stress parliamentary stability. That tilts the baseline to No.\n- Reasons for Yes: Serbia has a strong precedent of frequent snap elections under Vučić (2014, 2016, 2020, 2022, 2023). The PM’s resignation is a natural inflection point, and Vučić openly keeping the option alive suggests a non-trivial chance he decides to go to the polls, potentially aiming for an early-autumn election date to reconsolidate legitimacy.\n- Reasons for No: The ruling bloc retains a majority and can likely install a new cabinet without electoral risk. SPS and other partners appear wary of early polls. Calling yet another snap election 1.5 years after Dec 2023 could invite criticism and uncertainty amid sensitive external issues; continuity via a new PM may be preferable.\n- Why not higher: Clear statements from government partners about stability and ‘no need for elections’ plus the ease of forming a new cabinet point to No as the default. If a PM-designate is named soon, the probability of a pre-July 1 announcement collapses.\n- Why not lower: Vučić’s repeated “decision within ten days” signals real optionality. He has a strong track record of timing elections strategically; announcing a date before July 1 for a September vote would be consistent with past practice.\n- What would move me up: Public rifts within the coalition (e.g., SPS signaling exit), renewed mass protests or scandals undermining cabinet formation, or credible reporting that Vučić has decided for autumn snap polls; any formal steps toward dissolving the assembly.\n- What would move me down: Naming a PM-designate and swift progress toward cabinet formation; public statements from Vučić ruling out elections this year; or simple passage of time into mid-June with no movement toward dissolution/announcement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Serbia announce a general election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Serbia could face snap elections as PM’s resignation confirmed](https://tvpworld.com/85681783/serbia-could-face-snap-elections-as-pms-resignation-confirmed-)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a general election will be held is officially announced by the government of Serbia or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn response to protests, government officials have maintained that there is no need for early elections.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
