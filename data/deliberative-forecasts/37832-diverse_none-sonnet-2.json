    "review": "All three forecasters converge on very low probabilities (7%, 10%, 7%), which validates the core reasoning. Forecaster 2 makes a fair point about Databricks being 'IPO-ready' and the possibility of confidential S-1 preparation, which could theoretically enable a faster announcement. However, this doesn't overcome the fundamental constraints: the CEO's explicit public stance against a 2025 IPO and only ~40 days remaining. Forecaster 3 raises an important procedural point I should have emphasized more: resolution requires Databricks' own announcement (S-1 or news page), not third-party reports. This actually reinforces the low probability because it requires the company to publicly contradict its CEO's recent statement. Forecaster 3 also notes that companies 'rarely pre-announce intentions on their own news page without a filing'—another constraint I hadn't fully considered. The tight consensus (7-10%) across independent analyses suggests we're correctly calibrated on this being a low-probability event. No forecaster presented evidence of actual IPO preparation signals (banker meetings, IR buildout, market rumors), which would be the main reason to update significantly higher.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain my 7% forecast. The consensus validates the core reasoning: extremely short timeframe, explicit CEO opposition to 2025 IPO, no preparation signals, and status quo bias. Forecaster 3's procedural point actually strengthens the case for staying at 7% rather than moving to 10%—requiring Databricks' own announcement (not just press leaks) adds another hurdle. While Forecaster 2's 10% acknowledges IPO-readiness and confidential preparation possibilities, these don't overcome the explicit public guidance and compressed timeline. A company contradicting its CEO's public statement within 6 weeks would be extraordinary and would likely have leaked by now. The main scenarios for Yes remain: (1) dramatic market opportunity window opens, (2) urgent strategic need emerges, or (3) the CEO's statement was misdirection. All seem unlikely in this timeframe. I would update higher only with credible reports of imminent S-1 filing or Databricks news page activity. The tight 7-10% range across three independent forecasters suggests appropriate calibration for a low-probability tail event.",
