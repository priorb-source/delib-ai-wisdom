  "information": "In Latin America, the Venezuelan government has offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of opposition leader Edmundo González, accusing him of inciting a coup following a disputed election in 2024. In Brazil, former President Jair Bolsonaro is reportedly preparing to present legal arguments to defend himself against accusations of leading a coup plot. The World Bank has revised its economic growth projections for Latin America downward to 2.1% for 2025. According to the agents' analysis, there have been no reported coup attempts in Latin America so far in 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 66 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No military or elite faction successfully seizes power in any African or Latin American country before July 1; existing juntas retain control where they rule, and fragile democracies muddle through without a decisive military takeover.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A military or security elite topples an incumbent in a fragile African state (e.g., Chad, Guinea-Bissau, DRC) and consolidates control, or a sitting leader in Latin America or Africa executes a self-coup (e.g., dissolving legislature/annulling results) and faces no significant resistance, thereby establishing control over state and military before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Base rate: The recent African coup wave (Mali 2020 & 2021, Chad 2021, Guinea 2021, Sudan 2021, Burkina Faso twice in 2022, Niger 2023, Gabon 2023) implies roughly 1.5–2 successful coups/year during 2020–2023. On a 66-day window (~0.18 of a year), a naive Poisson with 2/year gives ~28% for ≥1 coup. However, 2024 saw no successful coups, suggesting the wave may have cooled and several highest-risk states are already under military rule, shrinking the near-term target set. Latin America’s modern base rate for successful coups is very low; recent events (Peru 2022 self-coup attempt, Brazil 2023 unrest, Bolivia 2024 attempt) failed, and there are no imminent high-risk electoral triggers before July 1, 2025. Signals: Africa still shows underlying fragility. There was a possible coup attempt in Chad in Jan 2025 and a thwarted attempt in DRC in May 2024—evidence of persistent elite-military tensions that could crystallize quickly. Sahel juntas’ consolidation may lower short-run risk of additional takeovers within those regimes, but places like Chad, Guinea-Bissau, or DRC remain watchlist candidates. Latin America: My assistant notes no attempts reported so far in 2025, Venezuela remains tense but Maduro already controls the security apparatus, and Bolsonaro’s legal defense in Brazil is backward-looking. Macro headwinds (e.g., weaker growth) rarely translate into coups within a two-month horizon absent a political trigger. Why not higher: Limited time window; the 2024 lull; many prime candidates already under juntas; no clear imminent Latin American trigger. Why not lower: The African base rate remains elevated relative to the 2000s–2010s; recent failed attempts show readiness and intent; coups can be fast-moving with little public forewarning. What would move me up: Credible reports of elite splits or mutinies in a fragile African state (especially Chad/Guinea-Bissau/DRC), mass protests paired with military neutrality/defection, or signs of a self-coup in a country facing an immediate institutional clash. What would move me down: Weeks of quiet across known hotspots, successful security purges/reshuffles that eliminate rivals, or international mediation that visibly lowers tensions. Assistant’s inputs incorporated: No 2025 Latin American attempts to date; Venezuela and Brazil developments appear legal/political rather than imminent forceful moves; macro downgrades don’t change short-term coup odds meaningfully.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to [Powell & Thyne (2011, p. 252)](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf), a coup is \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\" In recent years, some of the coups in Africa have been:&#x20;\n\n* [Mali August 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Mali May 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Niger March 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Nigerien_coup_attempt) (attempt)\n* [Niger July 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nigerien_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Gabon August 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Gabonese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Chad January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%27Djamena_attack) (possible attempt)\n* [Burkina Faso January 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Burkina Faso September 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)&#x20;\n* [Guinea September 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n\nLatin America has had the following coup attempts in recent years:\n\n* [Peru self-coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Peruvian_self-coup_attempt), December 2022\n* [Brazil Congress attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack), January 2023\n* [Bolivia coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bolivian_coup_attempt), June 2024\n\nSee also: [VoA by the numbers Coups in Africa](https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is a successful coup d’état in any country on the African continent or Latin America before July 1, 2025, according to credible media reports. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nLatin America is defined as any country in North America or South America whose primary language is Spanish, Portuguese or French.\n\nA coup d’état (often shortened to \"coup\") is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) as an event in which a state's military or other components of its power structure overthrow the existing political authority.&#x20;\n\nA \"successful\" coup is defined as a coup in which the group or person attempting to seize power establishes control over both the government and military, and will be considered to have succeeded once any significant resistance to their authority has ceased.&#x20;\n\nA self-coup, [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup) as a political leader, having come to power through legal means, remaining in power through illegal means, will count. This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Latin America, the Venezuelan government has offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of opposition leader Edmundo González, accusing him of inciting a coup following a disputed election in 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
