    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize persistence/momentum in IP and the lack of a known May shock, which matches my base reasoning. They also flag preliminary-data volatility and base effects as the main downside risks—points I had considered but they articulated clearly. Neither brings new high-frequency evidence (PMIs, utilities load, autos schedules, or mining output) that would materially shift the view. Their arguments are sound and consistent with a nowcast framing, but they don’t add concrete signals to warrant a change.",
    "rationale": "April 2025 YoY was +1.49% and commentary indicates the level was at or near record highs. To flip May YoY negative would likely require both an unusually strong May 2024 base and a sizable May 2025 MoM drop across multiple components—plausible but not the base case. Sector risks exist (utilities/weather, aerospace, autos), but mining/oil strength and overall resilience reduce the probability of a sharp, broad-based decline. Given no new evidence of a May shock and recognizing that the preliminary mid-June print governs resolution, I keep a high, but not near-certain, probability. No change from prior: uncertainty about utilities/weather and sector-specific swings keeps me below 90%.",
