    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the key resolution nuance: the question resolves Yes only if that specific BC Hydro page still explicitly names Tesla as ineligible. They also highlight plausible pathways to a No outcome even if the policy remains unchanged (e.g., migrating the brand call-out to another page, standardizing to generic origin-based language, or moving to an eligible-products list). This is the most salient risk and slightly stronger than how I initially weighted it. They add no new factual evidence but provide a clear articulation of website-update and communications-normalization risks over the next month.",
    "rationale": "The policy excluding Tesla is recent (Mar 12, 2025), politically anchored in a Canadian-preference stance, and unlikely to reverse within a month. Inertia favors the status quo. However, resolution depends on explicit naming on the exact page, and there is a real chance BC Hydro revises copy to generic language or relocates the brand-specific note. That communications risk is the main downside. I still see the most likely outcome as no change to both policy and page wording through July 1, but I’m nudging down slightly to reflect the page-specific criterion risk highlighted in the deliberation.",
