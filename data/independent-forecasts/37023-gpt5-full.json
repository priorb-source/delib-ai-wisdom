  "information": "The preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April 2025 was 50.8, the second-lowest level since records began in 1952. This represented the fourth consecutive monthly decline, a drop of 11% from the March 2025 reading of 57.0, and a cumulative decline of over 30% since December 2024. According to Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu, the decline was 'pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region, and political affiliation.'\n\nMultiple reports highlighted significant macroeconomic concerns. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 6.7%, the highest level recorded since 1981, with consumers widely citing worries about tariffs. The share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise increased for the fifth consecutive month, reaching its highest point since 2009. Concurrently, the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Indicators registered four consecutive monthly drops. Policy uncertainty was also a factor, with ongoing tariff implementation, market volatility, and potential changes in Federal Reserve leadership.\n\nSpecific industries and markets have shown negative reactions to the economic climate. Moody's Ratings downgraded the retail industry's outlook to 'negative' due to 'bleak' prospects amid the ongoing trade war, predicting that tariffs will harm profitability and raise consumer prices. In response to tariffs, Volkswagen has implemented an 'import surcharge', and companies like Temu, Shein, and Hermès announced price increases. The financial markets have also been volatile, with the S&P 500 Index falling significantly after the tariff announcement. Separately, the U.S. beef industry has expressed concern that poor consumer sentiment could negatively impact demand.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3–4 weeks (May 2025 preliminary reading is typically released mid-month).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — May sentiment at or below 50.8.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariffs continue to roll out and broaden; firms pass through price increases; gasoline/food prices remain elevated; equity markets stay volatile or decline; labor-market headlines skew negative (rising initial claims, layoff announcements); policy uncertainty persists around Fed leadership and trade. Consumers’ year-ahead inflation expectations remain high, unemployment expectations tick up again, and the index slips further to ~48–50 (or remains around 50) — at or below 50.8.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A modest relief rally in equities, easing energy prices, and clearer policy guidance (e.g., a pause/rollback on some tariffs or credible signaling that further hikes are unlikely) lift short-term inflation expectations. A solid early-May jobs report and calmer markets improve buying-condition readings. From an historically depressed base, sentiment mean-reverts and ticks up slightly above 50.8 (e.g., 51–53).",
    "rationale": "Baseline: April’s preliminary 50.8 is the second-lowest on record and capped four consecutive monthly declines, including an 11% m/m drop. The Surveys of Consumers noted the deterioration was pervasive across demographics. Year-ahead inflation expectations rose to 6.7% (highest since 1981), unemployment expectations rose for a fifth month to the highest since 2009, and the Conference Board’s LEI has fallen four straight months. Trade-related price pass-through is underway (e.g., import surcharges, retail price increases), Moody’s downgraded retail to negative, and equities have been volatile. This backdrop points to continued headwinds in early May.\n\nWhy the status quo favors No: Momentum is negative and the drivers (tariffs, inflation expectations, uncertainty) are unlikely to reverse materially within weeks. Given the threshold is strictly greater than 50.8, even a flat reading or a marginal downtick resolves No.\n\nWhy not lower: The index is already near historical troughs, which introduces mean-reversion risk. After sharp drops, subsequent months often stabilize or rebound modestly, and small swings of 1–2 points are common. A single month’s news flow (e.g., a market rebound, benign jobs/wage data, or tariff de-escalation) could nudge the index above 50.8.\n\nWhy not higher: The breadth of April’s deterioration and spike in inflation expectations suggest persistent pressure. Ongoing tariff implementation and visible price hikes are salient to consumers and could outweigh any short-lived market rallies. With unemployment-risk perceptions rising, the bar for an immediate bounce is non-trivial.\n\nWhat would move me up: Clear signs of tariff moderation or delay; sustained equity rebound into early May; noticeable decline in gasoline prices; stronger-than-expected but non-inflationary employment data; surveys showing easing inflation expectations.\n\nWhat would move me down: Additional tariff announcements or broader coverage; further equity selloff; uptick in jobless claims or high-profile layoffs; renewed volatility around Fed leadership; higher gas prices or prominent consumer-facing price hikes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe preliminary University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index for April 2025 was 50.8, the second-lowest level since records began in 1952.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
