    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a plausible macro-climate framing (likelihood of a drier 2024–25 winter given recent ENSO evolution) and emphasizes that crossing 20M hinges on Southern California moving into D1. That’s directionally right, but their argument leans on a prior (“a third wet winter is unlikely”) that risks a gambler’s fallacy and does not establish that LA/OC/IE/Bay Area are actually in D1 now. Still, the La Niña/dry-winter possibility is a valid risk factor I underweighted.\n\nForecaster 3 leans heavily on inertia and the SF Gate article. I don’t find that convincing: the article is from May 2024, not May 2025, and USDM conditions could have changed materially. Inertia only helps if the current “people in drought” figure is already near/above 20M; without present data, assuming that level is speculative. They also under-specify the population geometry: 20M essentially requires most of the LA Basin in D1 (and/or Bay Area), which is not a given.\n\nNet: F2 raises a legitimate pathway (dry winter → SoCal D1 by early summer) that modestly increases the chance, while F3’s reliance on stale narrative doesn’t add weight. Both seem overconfident given the lack of current USDM data.",
    "rationale": "My base view: reaching ≥20M requires D1 to encompass most of the LA Basin and/or Bay Area. USDM changes over one month are typically incremental unless a pronounced heat/dry spell triggers broad degradations. Reservoirs and hydrologic indicators after recent wet years provide some buffer, slowing category upgrades, but a dry 2024–25 winter (plausible under La Niña) raises the risk that South Coast metros are already at or near D1 by late May.\n\nGiven the short runway to June 28 and typical persistence through June, the critical unknown is today’s USDM footprint in coastal metros. If LA/OC/IE have already tipped to D1, ≥20M is likely to persist; if they’re still D0 or mixed, a jump above 20M within four weeks is less likely. I initially set 25% to reflect the need for substantial coastal coverage. After considering F2’s argument about winter conditions and June persistence, I’m nudging up to reflect the elevated plausibility that SoCal is already in D1 and that near-term deterioration (e.g., early heat) could expand coverage.\n\nUpdate: from 25% to 35% (+10) to account for a plausible dry-winter setup and June persistence, while still discounting overconfident readings based on year-old media framing and without confirmation that major metros are already in D1.",
