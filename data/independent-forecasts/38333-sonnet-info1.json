  "information": "The 2026 Florida gubernatorial race involves several candidates. For the Republican nomination, Congressman Byron Donalds has launched his campaign and received an endorsement from former President Trump. Other potential Republican candidates include Florida First Lady Casey DeSantis, former U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, and Lt. Governor Jeanette Nuñez. On the Democratic side, former U.S. Representative David Jolly has announced his candidacy. State senator Jason Pizzo also announced he will run as an independent. Florida's primary election is scheduled for August 18, 2026, with the general election on November 3, 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement is made. Suarez either continues deliberating, decides not to run, or announces after July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Suarez continues weighing his options through late June but decides he needs more time to assess the race, particularly given Byron Donalds' Trump endorsement. He either delays his announcement until later in summer 2025 or ultimately decides not to enter the crowded Republican field.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Suarez concludes his deliberations in mid-to-late June and announces his candidacy, believing he can differentiate himself from other candidates and that his experience as Miami mayor positions him well for the gubernatorial race. He aims to announce before the July 4th holiday to maximize media attention.",
    "rationale": "The time window is very narrow - only 26 days remain until the deadline. The Axios article indicating Suarez is 'weighing' a gubernatorial bid is significant evidence that he's seriously considering the race, which increases the probability above baseline. However, several factors suggest caution: (1) He hasn't announced yet despite presumably considering this for some time, suggesting hesitation or strategic delay; (2) Byron Donalds already has Trump's endorsement, making the Republican primary more challenging; (3) The primary isn't until August 2026, so there's no electoral urgency to announce by July 1, 2025 - many candidates announce 12-15 months before primaries, but waiting until later summer or fall 2025 would still be within normal timeframes; (4) Base rates suggest that politicians who are 'weighing' bids often ultimately don't run or delay announcements. The status quo strongly favors no announcement given the short timeframe and lack of movement so far. For my forecast to move higher, I would need to see: concrete reporting of campaign infrastructure being built, staff hires, or statements indicating imminent announcement. For it to move lower, I would need reporting that he's leaning against running or that he plans to announce later if at all.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
