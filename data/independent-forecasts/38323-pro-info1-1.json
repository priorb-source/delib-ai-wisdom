  "information": "The University of Michigan's final Index of Consumer Sentiment (ICS) for May 2025 was 52.2, the same as the final reading for April. This followed a decline from 64.7 in February and 57.0 in March, marking a nearly 30% drop since January. The index's components also declined in April, with the Current Economic Conditions Index falling to 59.8 and the Economic Expectations Index dropping to 47.3. Consumers' short-term (one-year) inflation expectations reported in the survey rose to 6.5% in April, the highest since November 1981, while long-term inflation expectations increased to 4.4%. Historically, from 2010 to 2019, index increases of 8 points or more in a single month occurred less than 3% of the time.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks. The report is expected on the final Friday of June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recent final reading for May 2025 was 52.2, which is significantly below the 60.0 threshold. Should current economic conditions and consumer perceptions persist, the index would remain below 60.0.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Persistent inflation concerns, particularly around food and energy prices, continue to weigh on households. A flat or negative jobs report for May, coupled with ongoing market volatility or negative geopolitical developments, would suppress any potential rebound in sentiment, keeping the final June number below 60.0.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A combination of strong positive economic news occurs early in the month. This could include a surprisingly robust May jobs report, a significant and visible drop in gasoline prices, and a strong rally in equity markets. Such events would need to be impactful enough to quickly reverse the recent negative trend and push the index up by nearly 8 points, a historically rare event.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored by the current low level of the index and the strong downward momentum observed in recent months. The final reading for both April and May was 52.2, establishing a low baseline well below the 60.0 threshold. For a 'Yes' outcome, the index would need to increase by at least 7.9 points. As my research assistant noted, an increase of 8 points or more in a single month is a rare event, occurring less than 3% of the time between 2010 and 2019. The underlying drivers of the current low sentiment, specifically elevated short-term (6.5%) and long-term (4.4%) inflation expectations, are typically slow to change and are unlikely to reverse dramatically in just a few weeks. The status quo strongly suggests the index will remain suppressed.\n\nMy probability is not lower because consumer sentiment can be volatile and susceptible to surprising short-term swings based on salient news, such as a sharp movement in gas prices or the stock market. Therefore, a positive shock cannot be entirely ruled out.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the magnitude of the required increase is historically improbable, and the prevailing economic headwinds (entrenched inflation expectations, potential for tariff impacts) make a significant rebound unlikely. The weight of the evidence points heavily towards sentiment remaining below 60.0.\n\nI would increase my forecast with a surprisingly strong preliminary June sentiment reading (mid-month) or a confluence of unambiguously positive economic data. I would decrease it further if the preliminary reading shows another decline or if key economic indicators like the jobs report come in weaker than expected.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is greater than 60.0 for June 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
