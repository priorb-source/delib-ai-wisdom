    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 48 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — EnergyStar.gov is currently up and would likely remain reachable absent active decommissioning.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "EPA quickly retires the energystar.gov domain before July 1 (e.g., DNS removed/NXDOMAIN or host taken offline) so that IsItDownRightNow cannot reach it when Metaculus checks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The site remains live or is converted to a static/archived notice or redirects to an EPA page, but the energystar.gov domain still resolves and serves HTTP(S), which IsItDownRightNow will judge as up.",
    "rationale": "- Current status: As of May 7, the resolution source reports energystar.gov is up. Government web infrastructure tends to change slowly; even when programs are ended, domains often persist with a notice or redirect for months to years to avoid link rot and public confusion.\n- Elimination vs. domain retirement: The reported plan to eliminate the Energy Star program increases risk, but eliminating program operations does not require immediate domain takedown. Decommissioning a .gov domain typically involves coordination (records management, redirects, stakeholder comms). Seven weeks is a short window for full retirement.\n- Resolution mechanics favor Yes: The criterion hinges on network reachability per IsItDownRightNow. Even a 301/302 redirect or a simple “program discontinued” landing page would count as up. A No requires DNS/host unreachability or similar.\n- Precedent: Past U.S. administration transitions often left deprecated program pages online with banners or redirects rather than abruptly removing entire domains.\n- Residual risks keeping me below 100%: (1) The new administration might seek a symbolic, swift removal including domain retirement; (2) single-check risk—if Metaculus happens to check during a transient outage; (3) unforeseen IT misconfiguration during any rapid web changes.\n- Why not higher: Those nontrivial risks of an intentional fast takedown and the single-vantage check keep me from >95%.\n- Why not lower: The default inertia of federal web operations, widespread public references to Energy Star, and the fact that “redirect/notice” still resolves as up argue strongly for continued reachability by July 1.\n- What would move me up: Public signals that the site will be archived rather than removed; a visible “This site will remain for reference” banner; DNS showing long TTLs and stable hosting; congressional or agency statements preserving consumer info resources.\n- What would move me down: Credible reporting or official notices setting a firm near-term shutdown of energystar.gov; DNS changes (e.g., impending domain retirement, NS changes to null), or observed repeated outages leading up to July 1.\n- Research assistant input: None beyond the prompt; no additional information received.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
