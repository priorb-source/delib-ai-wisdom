    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Currently there is no officially scheduled independence referendum for Greenland",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The newly elected gradualist government continues its measured approach to independence, focusing on building consensus and strengthening autonomy incrementally rather than rushing to schedule a referendum. They may view 2 months as insufficient time to properly prepare such a momentous decision, preferring to wait until after July 1st to make any announcements about referendum timing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The government of Greenland, capitalizing on their recent election victory and responding to heightened international attention (including Trump's interest), decides to announce a referendum date before July 1st. This announcement could set a referendum for much later (e.g., 2026 or beyond) but would still satisfy the resolution criteria by being officially scheduled before the deadline. The government might view this as asserting sovereignty and democratic legitimacy.",
    "rationale": "The key evidence is that 'independence gradualists' won the March 2025 election. The term 'gradualist' strongly suggests a cautious, step-by-step approach rather than rushed decisions. With only 2 months remaining until the resolution date, scheduling a referendum represents a major political decision requiring internal deliberation, consensus-building, legal preparation, and careful planning.\n\nHistorically, major constitutional decisions like independence referendums take months or years to prepare, even when there's political will. The fact that no additional information is available from the research assistant suggests there has been no recent reporting of imminent referendum announcements.\n\nHowever, the probability isn't extremely low because: (1) announcing a referendum date is different from holding one - they could schedule it for 2026 or later; (2) the recent election victory might provide momentum; (3) Trump's continued interest could accelerate matters; (4) 2 months is sufficient time for a political announcement even if logistics take longer.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because gradualists by definition favor slow, methodical approaches, and rushing major decisions is inconsistent with that philosophy. It's not lower because the political authority exists, international attention is high, and an announcement (as opposed to actually holding the referendum) is procedurally possible within the timeframe.\n\nI would update higher if: reports emerged of active referendum planning, officials made statements about imminent scheduling, or political pressure intensified. I would update lower if: officials emphasized patience and gradual steps, or focused publicly on other priorities first.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
