    "review": "All three forecasters converged on very similar reasoning with forecasts ranging from 58-65%. We all identified the same key factors: Mexico's strong historical pattern of sub-3% unemployment, the potential downside risk from tariff-related disruptions, the lag between policy changes and employment effects, and the critical lack of Q1 2025 data. No forecaster introduced information I hadn't considered. Forecaster 2's slightly lower 58% forecast reflects a more cautious weighting of tariff risks, while Forecaster 3 independently arrived at my 65% forecast using nearly identical logic. The narrow 7-percentage-point range suggests good consensus on the underlying dynamics. The most salient point raised across all analyses is how much we're operating in an information vacuum without recent unemployment data - we're all essentially extrapolating from historical patterns while acknowledging new headwinds.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I find no compelling reason to update significantly. The core reasoning remains robust: Mexico has a strong track record of maintaining unemployment below 3%, employment effects from trade disruptions typically lag by several months, and we're forecasting April 2025 data at the end of April when such effects may not yet be fully reflected. Forecaster 2's more conservative 58% appropriately weights uncertainty, but I believe slightly underweights the strength of the historical baseline and the sticky nature of employment data. The fact that Forecaster 3 independently reached 65% using very similar logic validates my original reasoning. The 3.0% threshold precision adds risk, but not enough to warrant moving significantly lower given Mexico's consistent performance. Without new data showing Q1 2025 deterioration or evidence of rapid manufacturing job losses, the status quo baseline should carry substantial weight.",
