  "information": "The current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is Brooke Rollins, who was sworn in around February 2025. Secretary Rollins has expressed support for SNAP reforms as part of a 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative, which is also championed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In legislative developments, the House Budget Committee has cleared a Republican spending package that includes proposed cuts to SNAP and stricter work requirements. Separately, Secretary Rollins plans to announce a USDA reorganization plan and further staff reductions in late May 2025.\n\nSeveral states are pursuing federal waivers to restrict the use of SNAP benefits for certain items. Nebraska became the first state to receive a waiver to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks, with the ban taking effect on January 1, 2026. Following this, Idaho submitted a similar waiver on May 16, 2025, to ban soft drinks and candy, with a decision expected in the coming weeks. Arkansas is seeking USDA clearance to make candy and soda ineligible starting in July 2026, while also proposing to add rotisserie chicken to the list of eligible foods. Indiana is also pursuing similar restrictions.\n\nChanges to national SNAP eligibility rules require either a congressional amendment to the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 or a formal USDA rulemaking process. The Act broadly authorizes SNAP benefits for 'any food or food product intended for human consumption.' In the past, the USDA has rejected state waiver requests to restrict specific food items due to concerns about implementation challenges, costs, and the potential impact on recipients. According to the USDA, approximately 20% of all SNAP spending goes towards sugary drinks and snacks.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (from May 20, 2025, to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The USDA's 'What Can SNAP Buy?' webpage continues to list 'snack foods' as an eligible item, resulting in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "In late May or June 2025, as part of the 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative, USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins directs an immediate update to the SNAP guidance webpage to signal a new policy direction. The phrase 'snack foods' is removed as a quick, symbolic action preceding formal regulatory changes.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the administration's desire for SNAP reform, the bureaucratic process for changing official public-facing guidance, even for a website text update, takes longer than six weeks. The USDA prioritizes the more complex tasks of processing state waivers and drafting new regulations, leaving the existing webpage unchanged as of the July 1, 2025 resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant power of bureaucratic inertia over a very short timeframe. The resolution date is less than six weeks away. While the new administration and USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins have clearly signaled strong intent to restrict 'unhealthy' food purchases with SNAP benefits, implementing such changes at a national level is complex. There are two primary paths for a 'No' outcome: a formal rulemaking process or a legislative act. Both of these are impossible to complete by July 1, 2025. The only remaining path is a rapid, top-down directive to alter the website's text as a symbolic measure. This is a non-zero possibility given the political motivation. However, government agencies typically have review processes for changing public guidance to ensure consistency and avoid confusion, which slows things down. The USDA's current focus appears to be on processing state-level waivers (like Nebraska's and Idaho's) and planning larger reorganizations, which are more substantive than a website text edit. Therefore, the most probable outcome is that the existing text on the webpage, which serves as general guidance reflecting the broad terms of the Food and Nutrition Act, will remain unchanged by the resolution date. The status quo is the strong prior here. My probability is not higher than 85% because the new administration has demonstrated a willingness to move quickly and challenge previous norms, as seen with the Nebraska waiver approval. A quick, targeted change to the webpage to score a political win is plausible. My probability is not lower because the timeline is extremely constrained, and institutional inertia is a powerful counterforce to even the most motivated political actors.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is Brooke Rollins, who was sworn in around February 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
