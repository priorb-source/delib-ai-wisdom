  "information": "National polling data shows support for Reform UK at approximately 23-25%. A March MRP poll by The Telegraph provided data for the region. The party has confirmed it is running a full slate of candidates across Derbyshire. Political scientist Professor John Curtice has noted that Reform UK's voter support may be more geographically concentrated than widely distributed.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 10 days. The election is on May 1, 2025, with results expected within a day or two.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservative Party holds a majority on Derbyshire County Council. Reform UK holds no seats. Therefore, the status quo outcome is No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative vote declines significantly from 2021, but both Labour and Reform UK benefit. Under the first-past-the-post system, this allows Labour to become the largest party, or results in no overall control with either Labour or the Conservatives holding the most seats. Reform UK wins several seats but not enough to be the largest party.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK's high national polling numbers translate exceptionally well at the local level, proving to be geographically concentrated in key divisions. The Conservative vote collapses almost entirely towards Reform candidates, who are seen as the main anti-establishment choice. The Labour vote does not grow enough to counter this surge, allowing Reform UK to win a plurality of seats.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant structural hurdles Reform UK faces, despite its strong national polling. The status quo is a large Conservative majority (45 of 64 seats in 2021), and overcoming this inertia is a monumental task for a new party with limited local infrastructure. The first-past-the-post electoral system for council seats tends to penalize parties whose support is evenly distributed, as noted by Professor John Curtice. While Reform's 23-25% national poll share is impressive, it is more likely to result in them winning a handful of seats and splitting the right-wing vote (potentially helping Labour) than it is to result in them becoming the single largest party. Established parties like the Conservatives and Labour have significant advantages in incumbency, name recognition, and local campaign operations.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 8% because Reform UK's national surge is real and cannot be entirely discounted. The party is running a full slate of candidates, which is a necessary condition for success. If the Conservative vote collapses entirely and transfers en masse to Reform in specific areas, a shock result is possible, though unlikely.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because winning the 'most seats' is a very high bar. Historical precedent (e.g., UKIP in the 2010s) shows that high national polls for a challenger party on the right do not easily translate into becoming the largest party on a county council. A more probable outcome is that Reform wins some seats but the primary contest for control remains between the Conservatives and Labour.\n\nI would increase my forecast if reliable local polling for Derbyshire showed Reform UK in the lead, or if there were mass defections of incumbent Conservative councillors to Reform. I would decrease it if polling suggested the anti-Conservative swing was benefiting Labour more than Reform within the county.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
