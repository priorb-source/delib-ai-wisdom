  "information": "Protests have been ongoing in Turkey since the arrest of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem İmamoğlu on March 19, 2025, on corruption charges. Reports from various news outlets cited turnouts in the hundreds of thousands. The Republican People's Party (CHP) claimed that over 2 million people participated in a protest in Istanbul on March 29. The party announced plans for continued protests. Following the initial wave of demonstrations, Turkish authorities detained 1,133 people between March 19 and March 23. In response to the protests, nearly 1,900 people, including journalists, had been rounded up by late March.\n\nOn May 1, 2025, Labor Day events in Istanbul included authorized marches and unauthorized protests. According to the Istanbul Governor's Office, authorized marches in the Kadıköy and Kartal districts had a combined participation of around 65,000 people. Authorities deployed over 52,000 police officers. Clashes occurred during attempts to hold unauthorized demonstrations, particularly near Taksim Square, leading to the detention of 384 people. A court later ordered the release of 374 of those detained, while others were released on bail or remained in custody.\n\nTurkey's high inflation rate was reported at approximately 48.6% in early 2025. In the legal sphere, an indictment was prepared for 14 youths arrested during the Saraçhane protests, with their first hearing scheduled for May 30, 2025. Separately, the trial for manager Ayşe Barım, related to her alleged role in the 2013 Gezi Park protests, is scheduled for July 7, 2025. Amnesty International's 2024-25 report highlighted what it described as human rights violations in Turkey, including restrictions on peaceful protests and the prosecution of journalists and opposition figures. The organization also condemned the arrests made ahead of the May 1st protests and called for the lifting of the ban on demonstrations in Taksim Square.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 55 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Carnegie’s Global Protest Tracker treats the post–March 19 demonstrations as a single protest wave with a March start date and does not create a new entry. Authorities continue to restrict large gatherings; any additional actions remain fragmented or smaller than 10,000, or are considered continuations of the same wave. No distinct new protest of 10,000+ begins between now and June 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A distinct, new protest wave with 10,000+ participants begins after May 7 and before July 1 (e.g., a large CHP-organized nationwide rally framed as a new campaign, major labor/economic protests after fresh policy moves, or a sizable late-June Pride mobilization) and the Global Protest Tracker adds a separate entry with that new start date.",
    "rationale": "- Framing and start date matter: The Global Protest Tracker typically records a protest wave with a single start date. The mass demonstrations tied to Ekrem İmamoğlu’s March 19 arrest—and the very large turnouts reported in late March—would likely be entered (if at all) with a March start date, which would not satisfy this question. This pushes the status quo toward No unless a new, clearly distinct wave begins in the time window.\n- Capacity for large protests exists: Per the research assistant, May 1 authorized marches in Istanbul districts drew ~65,000 combined, and earlier protests drew hundreds of thousands. This shows the ability to exceed the 10,000 threshold when events are authorized or strongly mobilized.\n- Constraints and enforcement: Turkish authorities have been restrictive (thousands detained across March and May Day actions). Unauthorized attempts (e.g., near Taksim) tend to be suppressed before they scale. This reduces the odds that a spontaneous, clearly distinct new protest wave of 10,000+ will emerge and be recognized by Carnegie as separate from the March-started wave.\n- Calendar/watch items: Potential new-wave triggers before July 1 include: a fresh opposition mobilization framed as a new campaign (not just a continuation), a major economic shock/policy (price hikes/austerity) prompting union-led actions, or a sizable Pride mobilization in late June. Any of these could plausibly surpass 10,000. However, absent a new trigger or framing, Carnegie is more likely to treat further events as continuations of the March wave.\n- Why not higher: The start-date requirement is a high bar; the tracker’s editorial practice of assigning a single start date to a wave and the current crackdown make a new, separately-listed 10,000+ protest in the next ~8 weeks less likely than not.\n- Why not lower: Demonstrated mobilization capacity (65k on May 1 in authorized areas) and ongoing political tension mean a new, distinct mass event remains plausible within the window.\n- What would move me up: CHP or unions announcing a large, nationwide rally explicitly launched as a new campaign; a major economic or legal development that sparks fresh protests; reports of a large Pride event being organized with expectations of 10k+; evidence that Carnegie has begun adding a new Turkey entry with a late-May/June start date.\n- What would move me down: Signs of de-escalation (e.g., release or legal developments that defuse tensions), explicit bans and successful preemptions of large gatherings, or indications that Carnegie added the 2025 Turkey protests only with a March start date and is unlikely to create a separate entry.",
