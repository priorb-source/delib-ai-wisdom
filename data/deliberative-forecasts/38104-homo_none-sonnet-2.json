    "review": "All three of us identified the critical challenge: the all-or-nothing requirement creating a multiplicative probability problem. Forecaster 3 raises particularly compelling points I hadn't fully weighted: (1) law enforcement resources stretching thin over time, (2) the sharp decline in recapture rates after initial window, and (3) the possibility of interstate flight complicating jurisdictional matters. Their mathematical intuition seems sound - even if each remaining escapee has a 70-80% individual recapture probability, with 5-7 still at large, the joint probability of catching ALL drops significantly (potentially to 15-30% range). Forecaster 2's analysis aligns closely with mine, emphasizing the 48-72 hour window and noting that those still free after two weeks likely have better resources. However, both Forecaster 2 and I may have been slightly optimistic given the multiplicative nature of the problem.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the mathematical structure of this question is more constraining than my initial forecast suggested. If we conservatively estimate 5-6 escapees remain at large (assuming 1-2 more captures since May 19), and assign each a 75% probability of recapture in the remaining 32 days, the joint probability is only 0.75^5.5 ≈ 24%. Even at 80% individual probability, we get about 30%. The active state investigation and urban environment support higher individual recapture probabilities, but Forecaster 3's concerns about resource constraints and declining success rates over time are well-founded. The information gap since May 19 works against us - we don't know if the momentum continued or stalled. Balancing the positive factors (active manhunt, significant time remaining, early success) against the structural challenge (need for 100% success, multiple still at large, declining probability over time), I'm adjusting downward but not as far as Forecaster 3, as I still see value in the time remaining and demonstrated manhunt effectiveness.",
