    "review": "Both forecasters raise valuable points. Forecaster 2's observation about regulatory gun-jumping concerns making website announcements rare is astute - this effectively means only the S-1 filing path is realistic. Forecaster 3 introduces critical new information: a claimed $3.5B raise at $61.5B valuation in March 2025, just two months ago. If accurate, this is devastating to the Yes case, as companies rarely raise massive private rounds then announce IPO plans within 3 months. Both forecasters also note that confidential S-1 filings wouldn't trigger resolution until made public, adding friction to already tight timelines. However, I find their 10-12% forecasts too optimistic given these same constraints. The March funding (if real) plus zero visible preparation signals plus only 6.5 weeks creates an extremely narrow path. Their 'why not lower' arguments about opportunistic filing or compute needs are plausible but insufficient to justify doubling or tripling my probability given the overwhelming evidence against.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating slightly upward but remain more bearish than my peers. Key considerations: (1) The March 2025 funding claim at $61.5B, if accurate, strongly contradicts near-term IPO plans - companies don't raise billions then immediately pursue public markets. (2) The regulatory point about website announcements reinforces that S-1 filing is the only realistic resolution path. (3) With only 6.5 weeks remaining and zero reported preparation (no investment bank hiring, no leaks to WSJ/Bloomberg/Reuters), the timeline is extraordinarily compressed. (4) The base rate of top AI companies going public remains very low - OpenAI, Cohere, and Databricks haven't filed. (5) Even confidential preparations wouldn't help unless made public by July 1. My peers' arguments about opportunistic timing or secret preparation are theoretically possible but don't overcome the weight of evidence. The recent massive private funding is the strongest new signal, pointing firmly away from near-term IPO. I'm updating from 4% to 6% primarily to account for epistemic humility - perhaps there are preparations I'm unaware of - but I believe 10-12% overweights low-probability scenarios given the concrete constraints.",
