    "review": "Both forecasters make solid points about CDC inertia, mitigability via vaccination, and the short timeline. New to me from Forecaster 2 were specific figures (∼79 cases, ~45–50% CFR, 400+ high‑risk municipalities) and the note that the outbreak has unfolded over ~7 months without rapid acceleration. That actually reinforces a low chance of a near‑term Level 3 upgrade. I agree with Forecaster 3 that absence of verified urban transmission in major hubs is critical and that CDC rarely moves to Level 3 without clear traveler-relevant risk. I find Forecaster 2’s 18% high given CDC precedent for yellow fever and the added persistence hurdle: the notice must be >2 when checked on/after June 1, not just briefly elevated before then. Both analyses underweight that persistence requirement, which lowers odds further. I modestly acknowledge the rainy season/mosquito dynamics as a tail risk, but overall I’m closer to Forecaster 3’s line of reasoning.",
    "rationale": "The base rate for CDC issuing Level 3 country-wide notices for yellow fever is extremely low, even during much larger outbreaks (e.g., Brazil 2017–18). Yellow fever risk to travelers is substantially mitigable through vaccination, which CDC emphasizes at Level 2. Current reports suggest cases concentrated in rural/sylvatic contexts, with no confirmed sustained urban transmission in major travel hubs. With ~5–6 weeks remaining, a shift to Level 3 would require: (1) credible evidence of sustained urban transmission in a major city frequented by travelers; and/or (2) severe constraints on vaccine availability combined with rising traveler risk; and/or (3) marked health system strain. Even if such a trigger emerged late in May, the advisory would need to be updated to >2 and remain there to be observed on/after June 1. Seasonality (increasing vector activity in late spring) and Colombia’s emergency declaration add some tail risk of deterioration, but CDC’s historical conservatism for vaccine-preventable mosquito-borne diseases and the lack of current urban spread argue strongly for persistence at Level 2 through the resolution date. I therefore keep a low probability, with a slight uptick to acknowledge vector seasonality and reporting lags.",
