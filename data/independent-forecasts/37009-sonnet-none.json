    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "10 days remaining until May 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement is made, resulting in a No resolution",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Haley Stevens either decides not to run for Senate, continues deliberating past the deadline, or announces after May 1, 2025. This could be due to concerns about the race's viability, personal considerations, or strategic timing preferences that prioritize a later announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Stevens announces her candidacy in the next 10 days, potentially prompted by party pressure to fill the void left by Whitmer, Buttigieg, McDonald, and Rivet declining to run. She may have been quietly preparing while waiting for other candidates to make their decisions, and now capitalizes on the opening in what appears to be a weakened Democratic field.",
    "rationale": "With only 10 days until the deadline, the status quo heavily favors no announcement. The research assistant provided no information suggesting Stevens is preparing to run, and the CNN article indicates multiple top Democratic contenders have already declined the race. If Stevens were seriously planning to run, conventional political wisdom suggests she would have already announced or at least signaled intent, as Senate campaigns require extensive fundraising and organizational preparation. The exodus of major Democratic figures (Whitmer, Buttigieg, McDonald, Rivet) could cut both ways - either indicating the race is challenging and unappealing, or creating an opening for a lower-tier candidate like Stevens. However, the complete absence of any signals, rumors, or preparation indicators in the available information strongly supports the status quo. That said, 10 days is still sufficient time for a political announcement, and surprise candidacies do occur, especially when party leadership applies pressure to fill a vacuum. My forecast is not higher because there are no concrete indicators of preparation or intent, and the very short timeframe makes comprehensive campaign preparation difficult. My forecast is not lower because Stevens is a plausible candidate who represents Michigan in Congress, and political announcements can materialize quickly when circumstances change. I would update higher if news emerged of Stevens meeting with donors, hiring campaign staff, or making public statements about considering the race. I would update lower as we get closer to May 1 without any activity, or if Stevens endorses another candidate or makes statements ruling out a run.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Haley Stevens announce her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [Democrats lose another top contender for US Senate seat in Michigan after Whitmer and Buttigieg bow out](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/10/politics/michigan-senate-race-democrats-mcdonald-rivet/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Haley Stevens announces her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
