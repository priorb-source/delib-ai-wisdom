  "information": "As of early June 2025, the government of Uruguay had not issued an official public statement confirming or denying President Orsi's attendance at the BRICS summit. Media coverage at the time described the country's participation as 'undecided' or 'up in the air.' The BRICS summit is scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro on July 6-7, 2025. Other leaders, including India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are planning to attend.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days (resolution date is July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, June 5, 2025, there has been no official announcement confirming attendance. If no announcement is made by the deadline, the outcome is No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The government of Uruguay continues to remain silent on the invitation through the end of June, letting the July 1 deadline pass without an affirmative announcement, or it issues a formal statement declining the invitation, possibly citing a scheduling conflict.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before July 1, 2025, the Uruguayan presidential office or Ministry of Foreign Affairs issues a press release or an official makes a public statement confirming President Orsi's acceptance of the invitation to attend the BRICS summit.",
    "rationale": "The primary factor driving this forecast is the strong bilateral relationship between Uruguay and Brazil, the summit's host. President Yamandú Orsi's left-leaning government is politically aligned with that of Brazil's President Lula, who extended the invitation. Refusing a personal invitation from a critical neighbor and regional powerhouse would be a significant diplomatic move with potential negative repercussions, making acceptance the path of least resistance. Attending also aligns with a foreign policy of engaging with multiple global powers, a stance consistent with Orsi's Broad Front coalition. The summit's location in nearby Rio de Janeiro further simplifies attendance. \n\nThe probability is not higher because, as my research indicates, Uruguay's participation remains 'up in the air' with less than a month until the resolution deadline. This official silence suggests there may be internal deliberations about the strategic implications of attending, such as balancing relations with the US against closer ties with the BRICS bloc. The government could be weighing the optics and potential diplomatic consequences carefully. \n\nThe probability is not lower because the arguments for accepting the invitation are very strong. Maintaining a positive relationship with Brazil is a cornerstone of Uruguayan foreign policy. Furthermore, delays in confirming attendance at international summits are not uncommon. It is more likely that the current silence reflects logistical planning or diplomatic timing rather than an intention to decline. \n\nI would raise my probability if other invited Latin American leaders confirm their attendance, creating regional momentum. I would lower my probability if reports emerge of significant US pressure against attendance or if prominent figures within the Uruguayan government publicly express reservations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the government of Uruguay announce that its president, Yamandú Orsi, will attend the BRICS summit in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lula invites Mexico, Colombia, and Uruguay to BRICS Summit](https://en.mercopress.com/2025/03/04/lula-invites-mexico-colombia-and-uruguay-to-brics-summit#google_vignette) | [Uruguay’s participation at the BRICS summit still up in the air](https://www.plenglish.com/news/2025/03/02/uruguays-participation-at-the-brics-summit-still-up-in-the-air/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025 the government of Uruguay, or anyone speaking on its behalf, issues any sort of public communication (written or oral) confirming its acceptance of the invitation for President Yamandú Orsi to attend in person the BRICS Summit scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro in July 2025.\n\nSince the summit will be held after this question resolves, actual attendance is not required, merely the announcement of plans to attend.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early June 2025, the government of Uruguay had not issued an official public statement confirming or denying President Orsi's attendance at the BRICS summit. Media coverage at the time described the country's participation as 'undecided' or 'up in the air.' The BRICS summit is scheduled to take place in Rio de Janeiro on July 6-7, 2025. Other leaders, including India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, are planning to attend.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
