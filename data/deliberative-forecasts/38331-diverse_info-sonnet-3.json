    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 raise several important points I hadn't fully weighted. Forecaster 3's identification of Venezuela as having 'intermittent/ISP-specific blocks' is particularly significant - this creates a real reclassification risk if Wikipedia editors reassess whether it meets the 'currently blocked' threshold. Forecaster 3 also correctly emphasizes Wikipedia-process risks: editors could reclassify Russia or Venezuela based on monitoring data or consensus changes without actual policy shifts occurring. Forecaster 2's 98% seems overconfident given these issues, while Forecaster 3's 82% appropriately accounts for concentrated risk in the two less stable cases. The Pakistan example from Forecaster 2, while not directly relevant, does demonstrate that blocks can be reversed, though I agree Pakistan's political context differs significantly. Both forecasters agree the five hardline censors (China, Iran, North Korea, Turkmenistan, Myanmar) are essentially locked in, which aligns with my assessment.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast downward moderately. The key insight from Forecaster 3 about Venezuela's potentially intermittent blocking history is a concrete risk factor I underweighted. If Venezuela's block is not consistently enforced across all ISPs, Wikipedia editors could legitimately reclassify it within the 26-day window without any policy change occurring. Russia presents a similar but smaller reclassification risk. Calculating roughly: if the five stable censors each have 99.9% probability of remaining listed, Russia has ~96% probability, and Venezuela has ~88% probability, the combined probability is approximately 84%. However, I'm balancing this against: (1) the very short 26-day timeframe makes editorial changes less likely, (2) status quo bias strongly favors maintaining current listings absent clear evidence of change, and (3) my original Wikipedia process concerns remain valid. I'm settling on 85%, which acknowledges the Venezuela intermittency risk and Russia reclassification possibility while maintaining that the compressed timeline and entrenched censorship regimes make 'Yes' the strong favorite.",
