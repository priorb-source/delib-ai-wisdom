    "review": "Both forecasters foreground the same key tensions: short timeline and strong status-quo inertia versus unusually public signs of isolation, staff churn, and GOP outreach. Forecaster 2 leans more on the health/resignation pathway, treating the former chief of staff’s email and missed votes as elevating hazard; Forecaster 3 leans harder on base rates and the lack of concrete indicators (negotiations, signals from leadership) for a switch. I find Forecaster 3’s emphasis on base rates and the need for observable pre-move signals persuasive for a month-long window. Forecaster 2’s scenario is plausible but seems to overweight the probability of a rapid resignation given Fetterman’s explicit refusal to resign and the political context (Dem governor would appoint a Democrat; McCormick publicly urging against resignation), which reduce incentives and external pressure for that path. Neither raised decisive new facts, but the argument that a switch would likely leak via negotiation signals before July 1 nudges me slightly lower.",
    "rationale": "I continue to see three pathways to “Yes”: party switch (or re-registering Independent and caucusing with GOP), resignation for health/personal reasons, or ceasing to caucus with either side. The first requires negotiations and would likely produce visible tells (reporting on committee arrangements, coordinated statements). We don’t have those. The second is possible given concerning reports, but Fetterman’s public ‘won’t resign’ stance, the lack of visible acute deterioration, and the fact that a Democratic governor would appoint a Democrat lower external pressure for a quick resignation. The third (non-caucusing Independent) is extremely rare and operationally costly for him. Countervailing: GOP figures publicly urging him not to resign, and no signs of imminent procedural steps, both point away from a fast move. Still, the isolation and dysfunction—missed votes, staff departures, estrangement from Dem colleagues, and GOP outreach—lift risk above a near-zero monthly base rate. Net of these, I’m trimming my estimate slightly to reflect the short horizon and absence of pre-move signals. Change: down from 12% to 10%.",
