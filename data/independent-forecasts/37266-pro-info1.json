  "information": "The U.S. State Department's travel advisory for Mozambique is currently 'Level 3: Reconsider Travel,' as of the last update on December 19, 2023. Specific northern regions of the country are under higher-level warnings. Recent security developments include suspected jihadist attacks in late April and early May 2025 in Niassa province, an area previously less impacted by the insurgency centered in Cabo Delgado. In response, the U.S. Embassy in Maputo issued specific warnings. The UK and Canada have also warned against travel to parts of Niassa and Cabo Delgado. Concurrently, ongoing post-election protests have led the African Travel & Tourism Association (ATTA) to issue its own travel advisory.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The US State Department's travel advisory for Mozambique remains at Level 3, with specific regional warnings for higher-risk areas.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The insurgency in northern Mozambique, while serious, remains largely contained to Cabo Delgado and Niassa provinces. Post-election protests de-escalate or do not spread into widespread, uncontrolled civil unrest. The State Department continues to use targeted regional advisories, judging the risk to U.S. citizens not to be at a life-threatening level nationwide.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The jihadist insurgency expands rapidly, with significant attacks occurring closer to major population centers like Maputo or Beira. Alternatively, the post-election protests could escalate into widespread, violent civil unrest, leading to a breakdown of law and order and making travel throughout the country unsafe. Either event would prompt the State Department to determine there is a pervasive, life-threatening risk to its citizens across Mozambique.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high threshold for a nationwide 'Level 4 – Do Not Travel' advisory and the relatively short timeframe. The current advisory is Level 3, and while the security situation is deteriorating, a full upgrade in under two months would require a dramatic escalation. The primary drivers of risk are the spread of the jihadist insurgency from Cabo Delgado into the neighboring Niassa province and ongoing post-election protests. These events, as noted by the research assistant's report on U.S. Embassy warnings and advisories from other bodies like ATTA, clearly increase the risk and are the reason my probability is not lower. However, the insurgency remains geographically concentrated in the far north, distant from the capital. The State Department typically prefers targeted regional warnings over a blanket nationwide advisory unless the threat becomes pervasive. For the entire country to be elevated to Level 4, the security situation would need to collapse far more broadly than has been observed to date. My forecast is not higher because such a rapid country-wide destabilization, while possible, is not the most likely outcome in the next eight weeks. It is not lower because the negative security trends are clear and significant. I would increase my forecast if insurgents conduct attacks in or near Maputo or if the protests lead to a nationwide state of emergency. I would decrease it if the Mozambican government, with international help, demonstrates significant success in containing the insurgency and the political situation stabilizes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mozambique receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMSN: [ATTA issues travel advisory for Mozambique amid protests](https://www.msn.com/en-za/travel/travel-preparation/atta-issues-travel-advisory-for-mozambique-amid-protests/ar-AA1wHavB?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
