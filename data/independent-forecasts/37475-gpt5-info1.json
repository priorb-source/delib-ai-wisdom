  "information": "The recall was initiated by Johnsonville LLC on April 5, 2025, for approximately 22,672 pounds of its cheddar bratwurst product due to potential contamination with hard plastic. The affected products were produced on a single date, February 5, 2025, and bear the establishment number 'Est. 1647'. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) classified this as a Class I recall, indicating a high health risk. The recall was prompted by two consumer complaints, but no confirmed injuries have been reported. The product was distributed to retail locations in ten states: Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The FSIS has noted concerns that the product may still be in consumers' freezers.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 52 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall page currently shows Active; if nothing changes it will remain Active on July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Effectiveness checks take longer than usual or the recall is expanded (e.g., additional lots or states identified), keeping the FSIS case Active through late June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Johnsonville completes recovery/disposition and notifications, FSIS finishes effectiveness checks without expansion, and the FSIS page status flips to Closed sometime in June.",
    "rationale": "What we know: Per the assistant’s summary, Johnsonville’s Class I recall (Apr 5, 2025) involves ~22,672 lbs of cheddar bratwurst from a single production date (Feb 5, 2025), distributed to 10 states, triggered by two complaints and no reported injuries. FSIS notes product may still be in consumers’ freezers, which is common language for retail-ready products but does not preclude closure once effectiveness checks are satisfactory.\n\nBase rates and timing: FSIS recall closures for limited, single-day production runs are often completed within 1–3 months when there is no expansion and the firm has strong recall capabilities. July 1 is about 87 days post-initiation; many recalls of this type are closed within that window, though not all. The multi-state retail distribution adds complexity, but the constrained lot scope (single date, single establishment) and absence of injuries favor a standard, contained recall.\n\nStatus quo anchor: Today the status is Active; if nothing changes by July 1 the outcome is No. I therefore discount overly optimistic timelines and keep probability below very high levels.\n\nWhy not higher: Risks that would delay closure include (1) a recall expansion if more affected product is identified, (2) slow or incomplete retail/consumer product accounting, and (3) FSIS taking longer to complete effectiveness checks for a multi-state retail recall.\n\nWhy not lower: Factors boosting odds of closure by July 1 include (1) a single production date with clear establishment number, which simplifies tracing, (2) a moderate total volume for a national brand likely experienced in recalls, and (3) no reported injuries and only two complaints, suggesting a contained issue.\n\nWhat would move my forecast up: Evidence of rapid completion of effectiveness checks or retailer recovery reports; FSIS updates indicating no expansion and routine progress; any mid-June pattern of similar recalls closing around the 60–80 day mark.\n\nWhat would move my forecast down: Any FSIS update expanding the recall scope, additional consumer injury reports prompting further investigation, or explicit indications that effectiveness checks are lagging into late June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Johnsonville LLC of cheddar bratwurst for foreign matter contamination issued April 5, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReal Simple: [Over 22,000 Pounds of a Popular Sausage Brand Recalled Due to Contamination](https://www.realsimple.com/sausage-recall-2025-11711268)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/johnsonville-llc-recalls-cheddar-bratwurst-product-due-possible-foreign-matter) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe recall was initiated by Johnsonville LLC on April 5, 2025, for approximately 22,672 pounds of its cheddar bratwurst product due to potential contamination with hard plastic.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
