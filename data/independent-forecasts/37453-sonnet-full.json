  "information": "Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has stated that her government will permit a citizen-led referendum on independence in 2026 if a public petition gathers sufficient signatures. Smith has personally said she does not support separation but believes the decision should be made by Albertans. To facilitate this process, her government introduced Bill 54, which lowers the threshold for initiating a referendum from 20% to 10% of eligible voters (approximately 177,000 signatures) and extends the time for collection from 90 to 120 days. The government also formed a panel called 'Alberta Next' to explore the province's autonomy and future relationship with the federal government.\n\nThe process for triggering a referendum requires a successful citizen petition. The petition must gather at least 177,000 signatures, which then must be officially verified by Elections Alberta before the government can formally schedule a vote. As of early May 2025, a group named 'Project for Alberta Prosperity' announced its intention to organize a signature collection campaign. Its president claimed they had already exceeded the required signature threshold, while other unverified reports mentioned 80,000 signatures being collected in 36 hours. However, no petition had been formally submitted or certified by Elections Alberta.\n\nThe discussion around a potential referendum occurs amid heightened tensions between Alberta and the federal government over energy policies, the carbon tax, and fiscal distribution, particularly following the re-election of the federal Liberal party. The proposal has faced opposition from within Alberta. Leaders of the Sturgeon Lake and Mikisew Cree Nations have publicly opposed an independence referendum, stating their treaties were with the Crown, not the province. The official provincial opposition, the New Democratic Party of Alberta, has accused Premier Smith of promoting separatism.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months (approximately 55 days from May 7, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Currently no referendum has been officially scheduled, and no petition has been formally submitted to or verified by Elections Alberta",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The petition collection effort continues but either fails to submit before the deadline, or Elections Alberta's verification process extends beyond July 1, or the petition doesn't meet requirements. Even if verified, the government delays announcing a specific date until after the deadline. The bureaucratic timeline for submission, verification, and official announcement simply exceeds the 55 days remaining.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Project for Alberta Prosperity group immediately submits their collected signatures to Elections Alberta within the next few days. Elections Alberta expedites the verification process due to political pressure and completes it within 3-4 weeks. Upon verification, Premier Smith's government immediately announces a referendum date for late 2025 or 2026, meeting the July 1 deadline for the announcement.",
    "rationale": "This forecast weighs heavily toward the status quo (No) for several procedural reasons. While the research shows genuine movement toward a potential independence referendum - with Bill 54 lowering signature thresholds, claims of signatures collected, and government willingness - the timeline is extremely compressed with only 55 days remaining. The critical factor is that no petition has been formally submitted to Elections Alberta yet. The required process involves three sequential steps: (1) formal petition submission, (2) Elections Alberta verification of signatures, and (3) government announcement of a referendum date. Each step takes time, and government verification processes rarely move quickly. Even if the claimed signatures (either 80,000 or 177,000+) are legitimate and a petition is submitted immediately, Elections Alberta's verification process could easily extend several weeks or months. The government would then need to make a formal announcement. This multi-step bureaucratic process completing in under 2 months, starting from a point where nothing has been formally submitted, faces significant time pressure. Additional factors weighing against Yes: significant political opposition from Indigenous leaders and the provincial NDP, and Premier Smith's stated personal opposition to separation (even while supporting the process). I'm not forecasting lower (below 5%) because: the signature collection efforts appear real, the government has created mechanisms to facilitate this, and rapid administrative action is technically possible under political pressure. I'm not forecasting higher (above 15%) because: the procedural timeline is very tight, bureaucratic processes typically move slowly, and there are multiple sequential steps required with no margin for delay. For me to update higher, I would need to see: immediate formal submission of the petition to Elections Alberta, or public statements indicating expedited verification timelines. For me to update lower: continued delays in petition submission beyond mid-May, or statements from Elections Alberta about lengthy verification timelines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAlberta Premier Danielle Smith has stated that her government will permit a citizen-led referendum on independence in 2026 if a public petition gathers sufficient signatures.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
