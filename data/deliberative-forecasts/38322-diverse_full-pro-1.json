    "review": "All three forecasters agree on the primary drivers favoring a 'Yes' outcome: the May 2025 final reading of 52.2 is already below the 54.0 threshold, the index has strong downward momentum, and key negative factors like inflation expectations and trade uncertainty are persistent. The main difference is the weight assigned to countervailing factors. My initial analysis was very similar to Forecaster 2's. However, Forecaster 3's analysis provided two crucial points I had underweighted: 1) The potential for mean reversion and normal monthly volatility, noting that a 1.8-point increase is not a historically large move. 2) The significant divergence with the Conference Board's confidence index, which rose sharply in May, suggesting the underlying consumer mood may not be as weak as the Michigan survey implies. Forecaster 3's identification of the upcoming May CPI report as a specific potential catalyst for a rebound is also a compelling tactical consideration.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward based on the deliberation. My initial 75% forecast was based on the strong downward trend and persistent negative fundamentals, which remains my base case. However, I find Forecaster 3's arguments about short-term dynamics convincing enough to temper my confidence. The 1.8-point gap needed to flip the outcome to 'No' is relatively small and falls within the index's typical monthly volatility. The sharp increase in the separate Conference Board index presents a significant contradictory data point that warrants caution. A single piece of good news, such as a favorable May CPI report before the survey period ends, could easily be enough to nudge the sentiment index above the 54.0 threshold. Therefore, while I still believe 'Yes' is the most probable outcome due to the weight of the existing negative factors, the probability of a small rebound making the outcome 'No' is higher than I first assessed. I am reducing my forecast by 6 percentage points to better reflect this uncertainty and the valid counterarguments raised.",
