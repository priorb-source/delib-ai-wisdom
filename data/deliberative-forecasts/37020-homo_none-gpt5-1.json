    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base-rate framing and correlation caveats. Forecaster 3 adds a clearer parametric view (per-category win chance ~20–30%, yielding 59–76% under independence), and emphasizes that the Morgan Wallen collaboration plus blockbuster single strength likely pushes Malone above an average nominee. Forecaster 2 reiterates correlation risk and industry preferences, aligning with my concerns. No new hard evidence emerged, but the explicit union-probability framing and the point that collaborations often fare well at ACMs are modestly persuasive toward a slightly higher probability than my initial estimate.",
    "rationale": "We’re ~2 weeks out, so little new information is expected before the show. With four nominations, the union probability favors at least one win unless categories are both highly competitive and highly correlated against him. Post Malone’s country pivot produced one of the cycle’s most commercially dominant tracks, and collaborations often play well with ACM voters—especially in Music Event/Single-type categories—suggesting at least one category where he’s near-favorite rather than a pure coin flip. Offsetting factors remain: strong competition from entrenched ACM winners, potential resistance to a pop-crossover lead, and correlation across nominations tied to the same song. Weighing these, Forecaster 3’s quantified range and the collaboration dynamic nudge me slightly upward from my prior 62%, but absent concrete insider signals or odds, I won’t move into the high-60s.",
