  "information": "According to the 338Canada statistical model, the Liberal Party is projected to win between 188 and 196 seats. National polling data indicates Liberal support is at 40-45%, compared to 37-38% for the Conservative Party. Polls also show strong performance for the Liberals in Ontario and Quebec, which together account for 199 of the 338 seats in Parliament.\n\nHistorical results show the Liberal Party won 160 seats in the 2021 federal election and 157 seats in the 2019 federal election. The last time the Liberal Party won a majority government was in the 2015 election, when they secured 184 seats.\n\nIn Canada's 338-seat House of Commons, 170 seats are required for a majority government. The analysis was conducted with 8 days remaining before the election resolution date. At that time, advance voting was underway, with reports indicating a 36% increase in turnout compared to the 2021 election.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Roughly 6 months (assuming the statutory October 2025 election date; outcome known on election night).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Liberals finish well short of 172 seats given current polling and fundamentals.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Conservatives maintain a solid national lead through the campaign; Liberals underperform in Ontario’s 905 and lose ground in Atlantic Canada; Bloc remains strong enough in Quebec to cap Liberal gains; NDP holds enough urban/semi-urban seats to prevent a Liberal sweep. Result: Liberals in the 110–160 seat range.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A late-cycle Liberal rebound driven by either a leadership change or a sharp improvement in economic sentiment narrows the race; Conservative stumbles shift soft voters; NDP vote collapses in Ontario and key urban centers; Liberals re-expand in GTA, reclaim ground in Atlantic Canada, and post strong second-place finishes turning into wins in Quebec. Seat models in final week show a Liberal median ≥170; election night yields 172+ seats.",
    "rationale": "I put the most weight on the status quo: as of late 2024, national polling and seat models consistently showed the Conservatives with a sizable, durable lead and the Liberals well below majority territory. Nothing in the fundamentals (incumbency fatigue, cost-of-living/housing concerns, leadership approval) suggests an easy Liberal path to 172 seats. Historically, movements large enough to flip a double-digit national polling deficit into a majority are rare in Canada without a major shock.\n\nOn the assistant’s report: it claims 338Canada projects 188–196 Liberal seats and that advance voting is underway with 8 days to go. Those details conflict with the statutory 2025 election timing and with widely reported polling trends through 2024, so I heavily discount that report. If, closer to the election, reputable aggregators (e.g., 338Canada) were to show a sustained Liberal lead translating to a median projection near or above 170 seats, I would meaningfully update.\n\nWhy not higher? To get 172+, the Liberals likely need: (1) clear Ontario dominance (strong GTA margins), (2) meaningful Quebec gains despite Bloc competition, and (3) limited NDP seat hold in battlegrounds — all while overcoming recent national headwinds. Current conditions don’t support that trifecta.\n\nWhy not lower? Canada’s campaigns can swing significantly in the final months. A leadership change, a major CPC misstep, or improved macro sentiment could compress the race. The Liberals have an efficient vote in key regions and a path exists if the NDP gets squeezed and Quebec breaks favorably.\n\nWhat would move me up: multiple independent poll averages showing Liberals at ~36–38%+ nationally for several weeks, clear 5–8 point leads in Ontario, improved Quebec splits vs. Bloc, and final-week seat models with a Liberal median ≥170. What would move me down: continued double-digit Conservative national lead into the writ period, stubborn Liberal weakness in Ontario’s 905, and Bloc resilience in Quebec.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Liberal Party win 172 or more seats in the 2025 Canadian federal election?\n\nQuestion background:\n[338Canada Federal Projection](https://338canada.com/federal.htm): \"The 338Canada project is a statistical model of electoral projections based on opinion polls, electoral history, and demographic data.

Fournier, physics and astrophysics professor at Cégep de Saint-Laurent in Montreal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Liberal Party of Canada wins greater than or equal to 172 seats in the [2025 Canadian federal election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Canadian_federal_election).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the 338Canada statistical model, the Liberal Party is projected to win between 188 and 196 seats.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
