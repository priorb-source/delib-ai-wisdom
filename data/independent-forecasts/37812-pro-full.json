  "information": "Several airlines announced the resumption or launch of new flights to Beirut for the summer 2025 season. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) is resuming service from Copenhagen and Stockholm in June. Emirates resumed its daily service from Dubai in February 2025 and added a second daily flight in April. Air France and its subsidiary Transavia also resumed flights from Paris in February. Other confirmed additions include a Wizz Air flight from Abu Dhabi starting June 4, a seasonal Middle East Airlines (MEA) route to Barcelona from June 26, and a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw beginning July 1, 2025.\n\nAccording to airport statistics, Beirut International Airport handled 1,254,550 passengers in the first quarter of 2025, a 1.42% decrease from the same period in 2024. While passenger arrivals increased by 9.33%, departures fell by 11.60%, and the number of transit passengers dropped by over 92%. The Lebanese government has also implemented new security measures at the airport to combat smuggling, including banning certain Iranian flights and increasing security checks.\n\nAs of May 2025, the number of active destinations was estimated to be around 39, based on OAG schedule data, down from 53 in May 2024. A number of airlines that suspended routes in October 2023, including British Airways, Lufthansa Group, Saudia, EgyptAir, and Pegasus, had not fully returned. Key Gulf carriers like Kuwait Airways and Qatar Airways also remained absent. Lebanon’s tourism ministry has projected that summer arrivals for 2025 will be 30% below 2019 levels.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month and 10 days, as the check will be on or after July 1, 2025, and today is May 21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current number of destinations as of May 2025 is approximately 39, which is significantly below the threshold of 52. If the current security situation and airline caution persist, the number is unlikely to increase by the required 13 destinations in the next month.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing regional conflicts, particularly between Hezbollah and Israel, continue through June 2025. Due to the persistent security risks and low passenger demand (evidenced by falling departure and transit numbers), major carriers that suspended routes in late 2023, such as Lufthansa, British Airways, and key Gulf airlines, do not resume their services. The handful of new summer routes are insufficient to offset these major absences, and the total number of direct destinations remains below 51.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant and credible de-escalation of regional hostilities occurs in late May or early June 2025. This boosts airline confidence, leading to a rapid, coordinated resumption of flights from multiple major European and Gulf carriers that had previously suspended services. This wave of reinstated routes, combined with other planned summer seasonal additions, pushes the total number of direct destinations above 51 by the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant gap between the current reality and the required threshold. As of May 2025, Beirut has approximately 39 direct flight destinations, a sharp decline from 53 a year prior. To reach the 'Yes' threshold of 52 or more, the airport needs to add at least 13 net new destinations in just over a month. While there are some positive developments, such as the resumption of flights by SAS, Wizz Air, and LOT for the summer season, these announced additions are few and are insufficient to bridge the gap. The primary obstacle is the ongoing security situation, which has deterred major airlines like Lufthansa Group, British Airways, Saudia, and Qatar Airways from returning. The airport's own statistics support this cautious outlook, with a significant drop in departing and transit passengers in Q1 2025, reducing the commercial incentive for airlines to return. The status quo of high regional tension and airline risk aversion strongly suggests the number of destinations will remain subdued. The probability is not lower because the situation is volatile; a sudden, unexpected ceasefire could trigger a rapid return of services by opportunistic airlines aiming to capture summer travel demand. However, the probability is not higher because such a significant geopolitical shift is a low-probability event in this short timeframe, and the inertia of suspended flight operations is strong. I would increase my forecast upon news of a credible, lasting ceasefire or a simultaneous announcement of service resumption from multiple major carriers. I would decrease it if the conflict escalates or if newly announced routes are cancelled.",
