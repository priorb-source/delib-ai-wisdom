    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 17 days, as the announcement for April 2025 data is expected around June 21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Following a large 7.6% increase in the previous month, the status quo would be a reversion toward the mean, resulting in a flat or slightly negative month-over-month change. This would be a 'No' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The significant 7.6% jump in March production acts as a high baseline, making further growth in April statistically less likely. Production either stagnates or contracts slightly as part of a natural month-to-month fluctuation, or key sectors like automotive or electronics see a temporary cooling of orders.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The strong momentum from March carries into April, indicating that the 7.6% increase was the beginning of a sustained recovery. This is driven by continued strength in domestic and/or export demand, leading manufacturers to ramp up production further to meet new and existing orders.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is centered on the principle of regression to the mean for a volatile economic indicator like the monthly industrial production index. The key piece of information is the strong 7.6% month-over-month increase in March 2025, which ended a two-month period of decline. While this is a positive signal, such a large one-month jump often represents a correction or a temporary surge rather than a new, sustainable growth trend. It sets a high base for April, making another consecutive increase statistically more difficult. Without additional positive leading indicators for April (such as strong PMI data or export orders), the most reasonable assumption is that the index is more likely to pause or pull back slightly than to continue its strong upward trajectory. My probability is not lower because the March figure was undeniably strong and could signal the start of a genuine recovery; a 'Yes' outcome is certainly plausible. My probability is not higher because betting on consecutive, strong gains in a volatile series without further evidence goes against sound forecasting principles. The high base effect from March is the primary driver of my forecast leaning slightly towards 'No'. I would increase my forecast if new data emerges suggesting the drivers of the March growth persisted into April. Conversely, I would decrease it upon news of specific production issues or a downturn in new orders for the region's key industries.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Northeast Japan region (Tohoku) show a month-over-month increase in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tohoku's March industrial production index rises 7.6% from the previous month, the first increase in three months](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOCC214DI0R20C25A5000000/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [industrial production announcement](https://www.tohoku.meti.go.jp/cyosa/tokei/iip.html) for April 2025 (expected approximately June 21, 2025) reports a monthly change in production (\"生産\") of greater than 0.0%.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
