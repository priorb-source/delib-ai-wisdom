    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "24 days (outcome will be known on July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Sudan has signed but not ratified the AfCFTA agreement, and the ongoing civil war prevents normal government functions.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing civil war between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) continues. The de facto government's entire focus and capacity remain on the conflict and the severe humanitarian crisis, leaving no political will or functioning legislative body to handle treaty ratification. The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without ratification occurring.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and unexpected comprehensive peace agreement is signed in the next two weeks, leading to the immediate formation of a transitional government. As a powerful symbolic act of re-engagement with the international community and a commitment to future economic recovery, this new government uses emergency powers to ratify the AfCFTA agreement just before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly confident in a 'No' outcome. The primary driver is the intense and ongoing civil war in Sudan since April 2023. This conflict has crippled the state's administrative and legislative capacity, making the ratification of a major international treaty a non-priority and a practical impossibility. The government is focused on survival and military operations. There is no functioning parliament to carry out the ratification process. With the deadline being less than a month away, the timeline is unfeasible even for a stable and functioning government, let alone one in the midst of a devastating civil war. The information about a draft implementation strategy being reviewed in May 2023 is outdated and irrelevant to the state's current collapsed capacity. The status quo is non-ratification, and the barriers to changing this are immense.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 1% because forecasting with absolute certainty (0% or 100%) is rarely prudent. This 1% accounts for an extremely improbable 'black swan' event, such as a sudden military victory or a miraculous peace deal that leads to a new government using emergency powers to ratify the treaty for symbolic purposes. It is not higher because of the sheer unlikeliness of resolving a complex civil war and completing a formal treaty ratification process in under four weeks. I would only increase my forecast upon seeing credible evidence of an imminent, signed peace deal and the formation of a functioning transitional government.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Draft National AfCFTA Implementation Strategy for Sudan Reviewed and Validated by Stakeholders](https://igad.int/draft-national-afcfta-implementation-strategy-for-sudan-reviewed-and-validated-by-stakeholders/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
