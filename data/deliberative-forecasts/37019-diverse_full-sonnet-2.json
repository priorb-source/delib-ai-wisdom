    "review": "The other forecasters provide thoughtful analyses that largely align with my reasoning. All of us landed in the 80-85% range, reflecting strong agreement on the core factors: Stapleton's exceptional track record (19 ACM Awards), recent momentum (4 CMA wins in Nov 2024, Grammy in Feb 2025), multiple nomination paths (6 categories), and substantial competition from Langley, Wallen, Johnson, and Wilson.\n\nForecaster 3 raises the most important new consideration: category correlation risk. If voting sentiment breaks against Stapleton in one major category, it may signal similar outcomes across others. This isn't perfectly captured by treating each category as independent. The 'spread the love' phenomenon is also valid - ACMs may deliberately distribute recognition across multiple artists rather than concentrating wins.\n\nForecaster 2 contributes a counterbalancing insight: Stapleton's reputation as a 'musician's musician' and critical darling likely resonates strongly with industry voters, who tend to reward craft and artistry.\n\nHowever, I believe these forecasters may be slightly underweighting two factors: (1) the sheer statistical advantage of 6 nominations - even with modest per-category odds, the combined probability of at least one win is high; (2) the recency and magnitude of his momentum, winning 4 CMA awards just 6 months ago from a very similar voter base.\n\nThe correlation risk is real but shouldn't dramatically shift the forecast when the base rate of winning with this many nominations and this track record remains very strong.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I maintain my 85% forecast. While Forecaster 3's category correlation concern is valid and I didn't explicitly model it in my initial analysis, I believe my original reasoning implicitly accounted for this through my discussion of vote splitting and competitive dynamics. The correlation risk prevents me from forecasting above 85-90%, but it doesn't justify moving down to 80% given the strength of the underlying evidence.\n\nThe key factors supporting 85%:\n\n1. **Multiple paths to victory**: With 6 confirmed nominations (research assistant agrees), Stapleton has numerous opportunities. Even if each category has only 30-40% win probability due to competition, the combined odds of at least one win remain very high.\n\n2. **Exceptional recent momentum**: 4 CMA wins in November 2024 (including Male Vocalist for record 8th time) and a Grammy in February 2025 demonstrate current voter enthusiasm from overlapping constituencies.\n\n3. **ACM-specific track record**: His 19 prior ACM Awards show he's particularly successful at this ceremony, not just country awards generally.\n\n4. **Industry respect**: The 'musician's musician' point resonates - ACM voters (industry professionals) value craft, which is Stapleton's brand.\n\nThe competition is strong, and correlation risk exists, but a complete shutout across 6 categories would be statistically unusual given his profile and momentum. The 15% probability I assign to No accounts for scenarios where voters concentrate on newer artists or deliberately spread recognition.",
