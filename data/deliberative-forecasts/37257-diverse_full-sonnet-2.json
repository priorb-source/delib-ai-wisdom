    "review": "Both forecasters provide compelling analyses that reinforce and refine my initial reasoning. Forecaster 2 makes a strong case for the lower end (15%) by emphasizing Dodik's historical pattern of brinkmanship without follow-through, particularly the 2016 referendum that was ultimately shelved. This is a crucial precedent I should have weighted more heavily. Forecaster 3 (24%) provides valuable nuance about the loss of leverage that comes with formally announcing a date - an insight that actually cuts against a 'Yes' outcome, as ambiguous threats serve Dodik's interests better than forcing a confrontation. \n\nThe most persuasive new arguments are: (1) the 2016 precedent of backing down from a referendum threat, (2) the point that announcing a date removes negotiating leverage and forces maximum Western response, and (3) Serbia's incentives to avoid a regional crisis. These factors suggest scheduling a referendum would be strategically suboptimal for Dodik during this timeframe.\n\nHowever, I also find Forecaster 3's countervailing points compelling about how quickly RS could move given a galvanizing incident, and the legislative groundwork is genuinely more advanced than in previous escalatory episodes. The narrow range of our forecasts (15-24%) reflects appropriate uncertainty given the volatility.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating slightly downward from 20% to 18%. The key factors driving this adjustment are: (1) the 2016 referendum precedent showing Dodik's willingness to back down from referendum threats, (2) the strategic argument that maintaining ambiguous threats preserves leverage better than forcing a confrontation with a formal announcement, and (3) the logistical reality that organizing even the announcement of a referendum in 60 days, while possible, requires either a major triggering incident or pre-planning we haven't seen evidence of.\n\nI'm not going as low as Forecaster 2's 15% because the current situation shows more concrete escalation than historical episodes - the constitutional consultation is complete, laws excluding central authorities are passed, and rhetoric is at unprecedented levels. A single incident (state property enforcement, new OHR measures) could still trigger rapid movement.\n\nI'm also not going as high as Forecaster 3's 24% because the leverage argument is quite powerful - Dodik gains more from threatening a referendum than from actually scheduling one, which would trigger immediate severe consequences and remove his bargaining position. The 60-day window remains genuinely constraining for such a major political step.",
