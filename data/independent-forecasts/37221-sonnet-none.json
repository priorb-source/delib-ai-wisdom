    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-3 days. Eurostat typically releases preliminary flash estimates for eurozone HICP inflation at the end of the month, so the April 2025 data should be published by April 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "April inflation comes in at or below 2.2%. The status quo suggests continued moderation in eurozone inflation, with the rate likely settling around 2.0-2.2%, consistent with the downward trend mentioned in the March news about February revisions.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Eurozone inflation continues its moderating trajectory, with April 2025 HICP coming in at 2.2% or below. This would reflect successful ECB monetary policy, stable energy prices, moderating wage pressures, and declining core inflation. The rate settles between 1.8-2.2%, aligning with the ECB's 2% target.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April inflation unexpectedly rises above 2.2% due to factors such as: temporary energy price spikes, increased food prices from supply disruptions, stronger-than-expected wage growth feeding into services inflation, or unfavorable base effects. The rate comes in at 2.3-2.5%, showing inflation remains sticky above target.",
    "rationale": "The key evidence is the March 19, 2025 news indicating downward revisions to February inflation, suggesting a moderating trend. Since we're forecasting for April and today is April 28, the actual data will be released within days. The 2.2% threshold is critical - it's only 0.2 percentage points above the ECB's 2% target. Eurozone inflation has been on a downward trajectory from 2022-2023 peaks, with the ECB actively implementing monetary tightening. However, inflation has proven somewhat sticky in the 2-3% range and shows month-to-month volatility. Without access to March 2025 data or April preliminary indicators, I must weigh: (1) the established downward trend and recent revisions suggesting moderation, against (2) the inherent volatility of monthly inflation data and the fact that 2.2% is very close to recent levels. The status quo strongly suggests inflation around or slightly above 2%, making 2.2% a borderline threshold. My forecast is not higher because the trend is clearly downward and the ECB's policies are working. My forecast is not lower because inflation remains somewhat elevated, month-to-month variations are common, and 2.2% is close enough to recent figures that it remains plausible. I would update higher if I had evidence of March inflation rising or energy/commodity price shocks in April. I would update lower if March data showed acceleration of the downward trend below 2%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Euro Area Inflation Rate be above 2.2% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nEuro News: [Euro falls as eurozone inflation sees downward revisions in February](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/03/19/euro-falls-as-eurozone-inflation-sees-downward-revisions-in-february)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Eurozone inflation rate for April 2025 is above 2.2% on an annualized basis according to [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
