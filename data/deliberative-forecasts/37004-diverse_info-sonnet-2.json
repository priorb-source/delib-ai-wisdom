    "review": "There's a striking discrepancy between the forecasts. Forecaster 2 and I are closely aligned (30-35%), both citing Liberal polling leads and structural advantages in populous Ontario/Quebec. However, Forecaster 3's 94% forecast describes an entirely different electoral landscape - claiming Conservatives have held 'sizable national polling leads for many months,' that 'advance voting is already underway,' and that 'no more debates' remain. This contradicts my research assistant's report showing Liberals leading by 5-7 points in late April polls.\n\nEither Forecaster 3 received fundamentally different information, or there's significant confusion about the current state. The specific details they cite (76% commitment rates, 2 million advance votes on day one, debate schedule) suggest they may be working from different data.\n\nHowever, Forecaster 3 raises one crucial point I underweighted: Conservatives won the popular vote in both 2019 and 2021 despite losing the seat count. This reveals a structural Conservative advantage in popular vote - they accumulate massive margins in Alberta/Saskatchewan while Liberals win more efficiently in Ontario. This historical pattern suggests that even in close races, Conservatives have an edge in popular vote specifically (versus seat count).\n\nForecaster 2's regional analysis reinforces the opposite - that Liberal strength in populous Ontario/Quebec creates barriers for Conservative popular vote wins. These perspectives are in tension but both contain valid insights about Canadian electoral geography.",
    "rationale": "Given the information I have - clear April 2025 polling showing Liberals leading by 5-7 points - the baseline still favors a Liberal popular vote victory. However, I'm updating upward based on the historical structural insight that Conservatives have won the popular vote in recent elections even when races were competitive. This suggests Conservative vote distribution (massive Prairie margins) gives them an advantage in popular vote tallies specifically.\n\nWith 6 months remaining, there's time for the race to tighten or reverse. The Conservative popular vote advantage in 2019 and 2021 means that even starting from behind, they have a reasonable path if they can close the current gap.\n\nI'm not updating to Forecaster 3's level (94%) because my polling data clearly shows Liberals ahead, and I have no independent verification of their claim about Conservative leads. I'm updating from 30% to 40% to account for: (1) the historical Conservative popular vote advantage I initially underweighted, (2) six months being sufficient time for meaningful change, and (3) maintaining appropriate uncertainty given multi-party dynamics.",
