    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core drivers I used: strong early-2025 heat momentum, waning El Niño support, and a high bar from past record Mays. New/useful points they raise: (1) explicit concern about a tie not counting; (2) framing the benchmark (May 2020) as particularly hard to beat; (3) the value of cross-checking with Copernicus/ERA5 before NOAA posts. I broadly agree with their logic. Two clarifications: (a) On NOAA’s Rankings page, ties are typically shown as Rank = 1 (tie), which likely satisfies the resolution as written; the “tie doesn’t count” concern may be overstated. (b) The India cool anomaly is real but small in global area-weighting; oceans dominate the monthly global mean. The CPC’s hot U.S. summer outlook isn’t very probative for global May. Net, their arguments are consistent with my prior, not a reason to materially move off it.",
    "rationale": "My base case remains that May 2025 is more likely than not to be ranked warmest by NOAA, driven by: (1) extraordinary ocean warmth and inertia carrying into spring 2025; (2) early-2025 months repeatedly at or near record in NOAA; (3) residual lagged El Niño effects plus a high solar cycle providing small tailwinds. Counterpoints remain: (1) El Niño has faded to neutral, trimming the tail; (2) the May 2020 benchmark is high; (3) April 2025 being 2nd shows records aren’t automatic. Regional coolness in India likely subtracts only a few hundredths of a degree from the global Land+Ocean anomaly, while widespread ocean and notable European/N. American warmth support elevated global means. On the tie issue, I expect a tie would still display as Rank = 1 on the NOAA rankings page, which would satisfy the resolution. I would move up if Copernicus/ERA5 post May as decisively record and/or if NOAA’s preliminary global SST anomalies for May are record for that month; I would move down if multiple global datasets show May as clearly 2nd–3rd. Given that Forecasters 2 and 3 largely echo my evidentiary base without adding decisive contrary signals, I’m holding my estimate.",
