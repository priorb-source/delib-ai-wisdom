    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling points I underweighted. Most critically, Forecaster 2 notes that *neither Trump nor Musk has ever used the exact phrase 'diversity visa'* according to the search parameters, and that Trump has historically used 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program' instead. This historical precedent is powerful evidence I didn't sufficiently emphasize. Forecaster 3's observation about Trump's reduced X/Twitter activity relative to other platforms is also important - if he's posting less on X now, that significantly reduces one of my two pathways. Both forecasters correctly stress that the exact-phrase requirement is far more restrictive than I initially weighted. Their convergence at 4-5% versus my 18% suggests I was too optimistic about the probability of this specific linguistic match occurring.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I significantly overestimated this probability. The zero historical base rate for the exact phrase 'diversity visa' from either account is decisive evidence. Trump's documented preference for longer formulations like 'Diversity Visa Lottery Program' suggests a linguistic pattern that makes the exact two-word match unlikely even if he discusses the topic. My original reasoning about high tweet volume and 40 days being 'reasonable time' failed to account for how restrictive the exact-match requirement truly is - terms like 'visa lottery' or 'diversity lottery' wouldn't count. However, I don't want to go quite as low as 4-5% because: (1) we have two independent high-volume accounts over 40 days creating multiple opportunities, (2) immigration remains highly salient and could spike further with the right catalyst, and (3) social media discourse can shift terminology quickly if a specific phrase gains traction in news coverage. A forecast around 7% better balances the strong historical evidence against the non-zero chance of an unexpected catalyst or shift in how either individual frames the issue.",
