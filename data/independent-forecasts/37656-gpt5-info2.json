  "information": "The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has filed a lawsuit challenging the executive order, asserting that it is a private nonprofit corporation independent of federal executive control and not subject to the President's authority. The CPB's funding is allocated by Congress two years in advance; it has received $535 million for the current fiscal year, which provides funding through September 30, 2027. Following the executive order, the CPB notified affiliated stations that funding could be halted but simultaneously announced its legal challenge.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the spreadsheet remains “in progress” or otherwise not marked complete by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Courts quickly enjoin any executive attempt to halt CPB disbursements; appropriated funds continue to flow; Congress does not pass a rescission or zero-out CPB before July 1; the tracker maintainers keep the item as “in progress” or similar.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration successfully halts CPB/NPR/PBS-related federal disbursements (even temporarily) and the tracker interprets that as achieving the objective and flips the status to “complete” before July 1; or Congress passes and the President signs a law rescinding/zeroing CPB funding ahead of July 1 and the tracker updates to “complete.”",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and inertia: The item is currently marked “in progress.” With only ~6 weeks left, the default is that it stays that way. Trackers typically require a concrete, durable policy change to mark “complete.”\n- Legal and fiscal constraints: As noted by the research assistant, CPB argues it is independent from direct executive control and its funding is appropriated by Congress two years in advance. The CPB reports having $535m for the current fiscal year and advance appropriations through Sept 30, 2027. Attempts to halt disbursements face the Impoundment Control Act and are likely to be enjoined; CPB has already filed suit. That makes near-term, definitive “funding stopped” outcomes unlikely.\n- Legislative timing: Even with a supportive administration, securing a statutory rescission or zeroing CPB before July 1 is a heavy lift, especially given Senate dynamics and the compressed timeline.\n- Tracker behavior: The fact the tracker remains “in progress” despite an executive order suggests maintainers are not crediting intent/orders alone as “complete,” and likely require actual cessation of funding or enacted law. Ongoing litigation and advance appropriations make that unlikely by July 1.\nWhy not higher: Significant legal hurdles, appropriations locked in, and short timeline reduce the chance of a decisive result that the tracker would mark “complete.”\nWhy not lower: There is some chance the administration manages to pause disbursements and the tracker decides that meets their criterion; or Congress acts unusually quickly. There’s also some uncertainty about the tracker’s exact threshold for “complete.”\nWhat would move me up: Evidence that payments have actually stopped (not just ordered) and are expected to remain halted; a court ruling upholding an executive halt; the tracker maintainers explicitly stating that an EO or administrative withholding is sufficient to mark “complete”; rapid passage of a rescission/defunding bill.\nWhat would move me down: A clear court injunction keeping funds flowing; public confirmation that CPB payments continue uninterrupted; tracker maintainers clarifying that only enacted legislation ending CPB funding counts, or changing the item to “blocked.”",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"stop funding for NPR and PBS\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) has filed a lawsuit challenging the executive order, asserting that it is a private nonprofit corporation independent of federal executive control and not subject to the President's authority.

Following the executive order, the CPB notified affiliated stations that funding could be halted but simultaneously announced its legal challenge.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
