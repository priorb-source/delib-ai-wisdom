    "review": "Both forecasters arrive at similar conclusions (Forecaster 2 at 18%, Forecaster 3 at 25%), with strong agreement on key factors. Forecaster 2 provides valuable new details: inflation at 2.7%, the Fed actually INCREASED its inflation estimate in March 2025 (a hawkish signal I hadn't emphasized), and the US-China tariff agreement reducing economic stress. These strengthen the No case. Forecaster 3's point about CME FedWatch showing September or later and the cautionary note about 'forecasting certainty 6-7 weeks out is imprudent' are fair, though their 25% seems slightly high given the weight of evidence pointing away from early cuts.\n\nThe most compelling shared insights are: (1) the Fed's explicit 'not in a hurry' messaging, (2) the very short timeframe with likely only one FOMC meeting, (3) elevated inflation above the 2% target, and (4) recent strong economic data. However, I find Forecaster 2's additional evidence about the Fed INCREASING inflation estimates in March particularly significant - this is a hawkish adjustment that further lowers the probability of imminent cuts. The tariff agreement detail also matters as it removes one potential source of economic stress that might have prompted emergency action.\n\nForecaster 3's higher forecast appears to weight uncertainty more heavily, but given the directional trend (forecasts moving LATER not earlier), recent hawkish Fed signals, and reduced economic stress from tariff agreement, I find less justification for moving higher.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, the evidence continues to strongly support a No outcome. The new information from Forecaster 2 actually reinforces my original assessment: the Fed INCREASED its inflation estimate in March (more hawkish than I initially weighted), inflation remains elevated at 2.7% above target, and the US-China tariff agreement has reduced perceived economic urgency for easing. These factors compound with my original observation that major institutions recently pushed back their forecasts AWAY from early cuts.\n\nThe critical insight is the DIRECTION of expectation changes - Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, and the Bloomberg consensus all recently moved their forecasts LATER, from May-July to July-December. This backward movement is a strong signal that conditions are evolving away from early cuts, not toward them.\n\nForecaster 3's point about uncertainty over 6-7 weeks is valid but doesn't overcome the weight of evidence. With only one likely FOMC meeting (mid-June), explicit Fed messaging about patience, elevated inflation, strong employment data, the Fed's recent pause, and the notable absence of any economic crisis that would warrant emergency action, the baseline probability strongly favors No.\n\nI maintain 18% rather than moving to 25% because the directional trend and recent hawkish signals (increased inflation estimates) outweigh general uncertainty arguments. I don't move lower because tail risks of unexpected economic shocks or financial stress remain non-trivial over 6-7 weeks.",
