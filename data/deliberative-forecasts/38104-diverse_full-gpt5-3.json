    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the scale and momentum of the manhunt, the large rewards, and the arrests of accomplices degrading support networks—points consistent with my view. Forecaster 2 leans heavily on momentum and agency effectiveness but doesn’t explicitly account for the compounding requirement that both fugitives be recaptured; 85% seems too high unless each fugitive’s by–July 1 capture probability is ~92%+, which feels optimistic given selection effects. Forecaster 3 gives more weight to Massey’s serial-escape history and the 14 days elapsed without capture, which better reflects the harder tail of manhunts; 65% is plausible if each fugitive has ~80% capture odds by the deadline. Neither offered new facts beyond what I had, but they sharpen the case that ongoing pressure and rewards can keep the capture hazard elevated through June. Overall, their reasoning nudges me upward modestly but not to their levels.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining (~32 days) and the extraordinary pressure from USMS/FBI/ATF, plus $50k rewards and arrests of 14 facilitators, support continued high daily capture hazard. Eight of ten were already taken within two weeks, and lethal outcomes also count as Yes. Countervailing: strong selection effect—the remaining two are likely the most capable at evasion; Massey’s prior escapes are a real negative indicator; 14 days without catching them suggests they’ve gone to ground or left the area. Requiring both to be accounted for by July 1 compounds risk. A rough hazard framing: if each fugitive has ~70–75% odds of being caught by July 1, the joint probability lands ~49–56%. Given the scale of the hunt and degradation of support, I move slightly up from my prior but stay below 60% due to the selection effect and compounding requirement. I would move up on credible sightings tying either to a constrained area, arrests of their closest remaining associates, or evidence they remain local; I’d move down if two more weeks pass without actionable leads or if credible reporting indicates they are out of state with strong support.",
