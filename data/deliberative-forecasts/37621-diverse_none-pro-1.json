    "review": "All three forecasters agree that with only 20 days remaining, the status quo favors a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 2 and I initially shared very similar reasoning, focusing on the short timeline and the fact that the main window for rule changes in March has passed. However, Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly insightful and changed my perspective significantly. They correctly identified the regularly scheduled Spring Owners Meeting, which typically occurs in May, as a plausible and remaining venue for a vote before the June 1 deadline. My own analysis had incorrectly assumed that any action would require a rare 'special session,' which drastically lowered my initial probability. Forecaster 3's point about this standard procedural window is the single most important piece of information from this deliberation, as it provides a clear path to a 'Yes' resolution that I had overlooked.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly increasing my forecast based on the deliberation. My initial 2% forecast was anchored to the belief that with the March Annual Meeting having passed, there was no standard procedural venue left for a vote, making a ban before June 1 extremely unlikely. Forecaster 3 convincingly argued that the NFL's Spring League Meeting in May presents a very real opportunity for this rule change to be put to a vote. This insight corrects a major flaw in my initial assessment. Consequently, the probability of a 'Yes' outcome is much higher than I first thought. However, I am not raising my forecast as high as Forecaster 3's 22%. The fact that a ban was not enacted in March remains a powerful signal that the required 24-vote consensus does not yet exist. It is certainly possible that the intervening time was used to build that coalition, but the absence of any media reports or leaks to that effect suggests that the opposition remains strong. My updated forecast of 15% reflects the newly appreciated procedural possibility of a May vote, while still weighing the significant political hurdles and the strong inertia favoring the status quo.",
