    "review": "Both add useful deterrent signals I hadn’t incorporated. Forecaster 2’s point about a united front (Trump/McMaster/Scott) backing Graham reduces Norman’s incentive to announce soon, even if those endorsements matter more for viability than for the timing window. Forecaster 3 introduces the strongest new info: reported explicit denials in Feb–Mar 2025, plus signals that Norman is focused on House re-election and possibly 2026 governor. If accurate, those materially lower odds within a 32-day window. I find these arguments broadly convincing; the only caution is that some specifics (e.g., formal endorsements for 2026, formal House “filing”) can be squishy in timing/definition, but the directional takeaway is clear: little to no pre-launch smoke, public denials, and alternative ambitions all push down the near-term probability.",
    "rationale": "I initially anchored at 8% on the residual chance of an end-of-Q2 fundraising-timed splash absent visible scaffolding. The added evidence of explicit denials this spring and indications Norman is prioritizing other paths (House and/or governor) make a late-June pivot less plausible. The endorsement wall for Graham further dampens the rationale to announce now. With only ~1 month left and no preparatory signals, a sudden declaration is possible but unlikely. I’m reducing to 5%. I would move up only on credible June reporting of staff hires, digital infrastructure spinning up, donor outreach specific to a Senate bid, or local media teasing a June launch event; I’d move down further if Norman reiterates a no, endorses Graham, or June passes mid-month with continued silence.",
