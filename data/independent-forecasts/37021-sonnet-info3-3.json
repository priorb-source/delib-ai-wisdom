  "information": "The primary factors driving recent inflation include increased production costs for businesses and supply chain disruptions resulting from the war. Intensified attacks on energy infrastructure and population mobilization have also been cited as contributing pressures. The cost of the 2025 Easter food basket was reported to be 18-19% higher than in the previous year. On the other hand, potential disinflationary factors include the NBU's monetary policy and a reported decrease in consumer demand. Some economists expect seasonal factors to lead to an increase in vegetable production and a subsequent decrease in food prices in late spring or early summer.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-3 weeks. We are currently on April 22, 2025, so the month of April is nearly complete. Official inflation data for April 2025 will typically be published by Trading Economics in early-to-mid May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Inflation remains elevated near the 15% threshold, with mixed pressures from war-related disruptions pushing prices up while NBU monetary policy and weak consumer demand provide some counterbalance.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine's April 2025 inflation comes in below 15% as the National Bank of Ukraine's monetary policy proves effective in controlling price growth, decreased consumer demand dampens inflation across most categories, and seasonal increases in agricultural production (particularly vegetables) help offset the elevated food prices seen in the Easter basket data.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine's April 2025 inflation reaches or exceeds 15% as the 18-19% year-over-year increase in Easter food basket costs reflects broader food inflation trends, ongoing attacks on energy infrastructure drive up utility costs, war-related supply chain disruptions continue to push production costs higher, and these factors outweigh the moderating effects of weak consumer demand and NBU policy interventions.",
    "rationale": "Since we are already on April 22, 2025, most of the month's price data has already been determined, reducing uncertainty considerably. The key evidence from my research assistant indicates significant upward pressure on prices: the Easter food basket showed 18-19% year-over-year inflation, there are ongoing energy infrastructure attacks, production costs are rising due to war-related disruptions, and mobilization continues. In Ukraine's economy, food represents a substantial portion of the consumer price index, so 18-19% food inflation would pull the overall rate significantly upward. However, countervailing forces exist: the NBU is actively managing monetary policy, consumer demand has reportedly decreased, and seasonal factors may lower vegetable prices in late spring. The status quo suggests inflation is elevated and hovering near critical thresholds. Given that we're late in April and the high food inflation data, I assess a moderately high probability that overall inflation will meet or exceed 15%. My forecast is not higher (e.g., 80%+) because: (1) non-food categories may show lower inflation or even deflation due to weak demand, (2) NBU policy interventions may be partially effective, and (3) there's inherent measurement uncertainty. My forecast is not lower (e.g., 40%) because: (1) the 18-19% food inflation is a strong signal, (2) multiple structural war-related pressures persist, and (3) we're late enough in the month that major disinflationary surprises are unlikely. I would update higher if I saw evidence of energy price spikes in April or broader inflation across all categories. I would update lower if data showed significant deflation in non-food categories or evidence of NBU policy being particularly effective in April.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's inflation rate increase to at least 15.0% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's annualized inflation rate is greater than or equal to 15.0% for the month of April 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/inflation-cpi). Under 15.0% resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe primary factors driving recent inflation include increased production costs for businesses and supply chain disruptions resulting from the war. Intensified attacks on energy infrastructure and population mobilization have also been cited as contributing pressures. The cost of the 2025 Easter food basket was reported to be 18-19% higher than in the previous year.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
