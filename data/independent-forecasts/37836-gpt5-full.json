  "information": "Direct air travel between Iraqi Kurdistan and Europe has expanded in 2025. In February, Aegean Airlines launched a direct route between Athens and Erbil, initially operating two flights per week. The new route brought the total number of countries with direct air links to Iraqi Kurdistan to 21. Following this, Athens International Airport's summer 2025 expansion plan includes new flights to Erbil operated by easyJet. Separately, German airline Eurowings has added Erbil to its summer flight plan from Cologne/Bonn airport, along with other new destinations such as Funchal and Bastia.\n\nErbil International Airport has undertaken developments to enhance its operational capabilities. The airport has commenced preliminary tests for night flights after receiving clearance for night landings, as part of a strategic plan to improve air communication systems and safety. In January 2025, a committee from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) visited the airport to conduct an inspection for its inclusion in the official list of international airports. This inclusion is expected to facilitate an increase in the number of international flights. The airport's operational capacity was also demonstrated during the Hajj season, with the Iraqi Ministry of Transportation successfully operating numerous pilgrim flights from Erbil and other Iraqi airports.\n\nBroader regional aviation activity and international interest in the area have seen recent developments. Dubai-based carrier flydubai announced the resumption of direct daily flights to Damascus, Syria, starting from June 1, 2025, after a 12-year suspension. This move is part of a wider effort to enhance regional connectivity. In a different development indicating tourism interest, British travel company Wild Frontiers is offering a 15-day tour of Iraq, which includes visits to historical sites such as the citadel of Erbil, despite official UK government warnings against travel to the country.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security or regulatory disruptions (e.g., regional escalation, insurance/overflight issues, or Iraqi CAA restrictions) trigger multiple suspensions in June, or flightsfrom.com lists fewer operational summer destinations than expected (e.g., several Iranian, Turkish, or Saudi routes drop out), leaving 31 or fewer destinations on/after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seasonal summer network plus recently added routes (e.g., Athens by Aegean, Cologne/Bonn by Eurowings) keep or push Erbil’s scheduled non-stop network to 32+ destinations on flightsfrom.com by July 1, with stable operations across Turkey, the Gulf, Iran, Jordan/Egypt, and a handful of European points.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: Erbil is a busy regional hub with broad connectivity across Turkey, the Gulf (UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi), Jordan/Egypt/Levant, Iran, some domestic Iraqi points, and several European destinations. Summer typically adds seasonal Turkish leisure points (e.g., Antalya/Izmir) and maintains Gulf/Iran connectivity. My rough count of plausible scheduled destinations already lands near or above 32, and summer tends to be peak. \n- New adds/expansions: The research assistant notes Aegean launched Athens–Erbil in Feb 2025 and Eurowings added Cologne/Bonn for summer. These support being at/above the threshold by July. Night-operations upgrades and ICAO inspection suggest incremental operational robustness, not a contraction. \n- Key uncertainty: flightsfrom.com’s listing reflects real scheduled service; if some routes are seasonal, charter-only, or recently suspended (especially to Iran, Lebanon, or select Turkish cities), they may not count. Security shocks could prompt last-minute suspensions. \n- Why not higher: Regional volatility remains a live risk. A handful of suspensions (e.g., several Iranian cities plus one or two European points, or a pause in Beirut/Cairo) could pull the count just under 32 on the exact check date. flightsfrom.com sometimes lags or prunes marginal/irregular services. \n- Why not lower: The breadth of Gulf/Turkey/Saudi/Iran networks plus domestic Baghdad/Najaf/Basra and European links (Vienna, Athens, Cologne/Bonn, possibly German/Scandinavian points) makes it probable to clear 31, especially in summer. \n- What would move me up: Verified current flightsfrom.com/EBL showing 32+ destinations already scheduled through early July; confirmation of multiple Turkish leisure destinations active in July; confirmation of stable Iranian and Saudi schedules in late June. \n- What would move me down: Reports of renewed regional airspace closures, insurance withdrawals, or Iraqi CAA restrictions leading to multi-route suspensions; evidence that several Iranian or Levant routes are off the July schedule; flightsfrom.com currently listing ≤31 for July period.",
