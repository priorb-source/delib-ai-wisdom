  "information": "The Indian government ordered X to block access to over 8,000 accounts in May 2025, citing a crackdown on 'anti-India content' and violations of local regulations. The blocked accounts included those of several Turkish and Chinese media organizations, as well as independent media outlets and journalists. X stated its disagreement with the orders, noting that 'blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship... and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech,' but indicated it would comply while investigating legal options.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - all seven countries (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela) currently block X and will continue to do so through the end of June 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the seven countries unblocks X before July 1, 2025, and Wikipedia's page is updated to reflect this change. Most likely candidates would be Venezuela or Myanmar due to their relatively less stable political situations, though still unlikely in this timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "All seven countries maintain their existing blocks on X through June 2025. The Wikipedia page continues to accurately list all seven countries as currently blocking access when checked on July 1, 2025. This is the continuation of the status quo.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes resolution. Each of these seven countries has established, longstanding blocks on X: China and Iran since 2009, Russia since March 2022, and the others for extended periods. These are authoritarian or semi-authoritarian regimes with systematic internet censorship policies. The 26-day timeframe is extremely short for significant policy reversals. China, Iran, North Korea, Russia, and Turkmenistan have particularly entrenched censorship regimes with no signals of liberalization. North Korea's internet is essentially closed to its population entirely. Russia's block is tied to ongoing geopolitical tensions. Myanmar's military junta and Venezuela's government maintain strict social media controls. The research assistant's report about India blocking specific accounts is not relevant since India isn't one of the tracked countries and the action involved selective account blocking rather than platform-wide censorship. The main risks to a Yes resolution are: (1) Venezuela or Myanmar experiencing sudden political shifts, though unlikely in 25 days, (2) Wikipedia editing issues or vandalism, though admins can annul in cases of edit wars, (3) definitional changes in how 'blocking' is categorized. The probability isn't higher (95%+) because there's always some tail risk of unexpected events or Wikipedia technical issues. It's not lower because the timeframe is so short and these censorship patterns are deeply entrenched structural features of these regimes, not subject to rapid change.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nAt the end of June 2025, will Wikipedia still list all these countries as \"currently\" blocking access to X (formerly Twitter)?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"Censorship of Twitter refers to Internet censorship by governments that block access to Twitter (officially known as X since July 2023). Twitter censorship also includes governmental notice and take down requests to Twitter, which it enforces in accordance with its Terms of Service when a government or authority submits a valid removal request to Twitter indicating that specific content published on the platform is illegal in their jurisdiction.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Wikipedia still lists X (formerly known as Twitter) as currently blocked in China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan and Venezuela at [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_of_Twitter#Current) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If the Wikipedia article does not list X as currently being blocked in any of those countries, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to July 7, 2025, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**. Admins will also use their discretion if there appears to be an [edit war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) or lack of Wikipedia [consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) and may annul the question in such a case; however, Admins will also strive to resolve the question as definitively Yes or No, and such an edge case should be considered a rare outcome.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Indian government ordered X to block access to over 8,000 accounts in May 2025, citing a crackdown on 'anti-India content' and violations of local regulations. The blocked accounts included those of several Turkish and Chinese media organizations, as well as independent media outlets and journalists. X stated its disagreement with the orders, noting that 'blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship... and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech,' but indicated it would comply while investigating legal options.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
