    "review": "Both forecasters mirror my core reasoning: tiny time window (~24 days), Morgan’s stated preference for a brief campaign, his history of flirting/not running, and no hard deadline pushing a June declaration. They add useful operational indicators (e.g., scheduled launch event, filings, staff hires, party registration milestones) but no new substantive reporting. I agree that the party launch could, in theory, be paired with a candidacy, but it isn’t necessary for the party work to proceed, which supports No before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~24 days until July 1 favors inaction. \n- Morgan’s own framing: He prefers a short (~3‑month) campaign and wants to watch the field, pointing to a later decision, especially if he runs outside the Democratic primary as an independent/third-party candidate. \n- Base rate: He has publicly mulled runs in past cycles (2018, 2022) without entering, slightly lowering near-term odds. \n- Field dynamics: Jolly’s entry on the Democratic side and Pizzo’s independent intent, plus GOP moves (Donalds in, Casey DeSantis pondering), reduce any immediate strategic need to jump in. \n- Party launch: Forming a centrist party could happen now without a candidacy announcement; if anything, his \"short campaign\" concept suggests decoupling the party rollout from a June 2025 declaration. \n- Triggers that would change my view: credible reports of an imminent announcement, formal party registration tied explicitly to his gubernatorial bid, staff hiring, filings, or a dated launch event. Absent such signals, the status quo dominates.\nGiven no new concrete indicators since the Politico piece and fresh entries that encourage waiting, I maintain a low but non‑zero probability for a surprise announcement this month.",
