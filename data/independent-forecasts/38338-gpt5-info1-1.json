  "information": "In mid-May 2025, John Morgan stated he would observe the field of announced candidates before making a decision on running for governor. He also mentioned that if he were to run, his campaign would be brief, lasting approximately three months. Morgan has publicly considered running for governor in previous election cycles, including 2018 and 2022, but ultimately did not enter the races.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 24 days (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Morgan continues to watch the field and tease the possibility, but does not make a formal candidacy announcement (e.g., at most launches an exploratory effort or comments to media) before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Morgan abruptly declares he is running—via a video/press conference or statement covered by major outlets and/or by filing as a candidate with the Florida Division of Elections—sometime in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "The base case is No. In mid-May, Morgan told Politico he would observe the field of announced candidates before deciding and, if he ran, would conduct a short, roughly three-month campaign. That plan implies an announcement well after mid-2025, likely closer to 2026 primary timelines. Historically, he has publicly weighed runs (2018, 2022) and then opted not to enter, which further lowers near-term announcement odds. With only a few weeks left, the daily hazard of an announcement is small absent a precipitating event. Reasons the probability is not higher: (1) his own stated intent to wait and run a brief campaign; (2) past pattern of not pulling the trigger; (3) no evident strategic need to announce this early for a 2026 race. Reasons it’s not lower: (1) he is wealthy, well-known, and could launch quickly; (2) he just laid out a campaign blueprint, indicating genuine consideration; (3) he might choose a surprise June announcement to shape the field or capitalize on a news moment. I would update upward on credible reports of staff hires, ad buys, event permits for a launch, filing paperwork, or reliable media indicating an imminent announcement; or if major rivals clear the field and party actors signal coordinated support. I would update downward if he reiterates a later decision timeline, focuses publicly on non-campaign initiatives, or if another strong Democrat announces soon and he praises them as the likely nominee.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill John Morgan announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [John Morgan lays out campaign blueprint for possible Florida governor run](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/15/john-morgan-florida-governor-run-00351005)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if John Morgan announces his candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn mid-May 2025, John Morgan stated he would observe the field of announced candidates before making a decision on running for governor. He also mentioned that if he were to run, his campaign would be brief, lasting approximately three months.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
