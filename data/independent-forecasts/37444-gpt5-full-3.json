  "information": "On May 2, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly denied a Politico report that the administration was considering lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, calling the claim 'unequivocally false.' Both Rubio and U.S. Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum are reported to be opponents of the idea. Furthermore, reports from May 5, 2025, indicated that President Trump is considering a bipartisan bill that would impose 500% tariffs on countries importing Russian energy and expand existing sanctions.\n\nA Politico report from April 24, 2025, citing multiple sources, claimed the White House was discussing the possibility of lifting sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline as part of negotiations to end the conflict in Ukraine. The report stated that U.S. Special Envoy Steve Wietkoff was the main proponent of the initiative and had instructed his team to compile a list of all energy sanctions imposed on Russia. Other reports have mentioned proposals from American investors and the former CEO of Nord Stream 2 AG to restart the pipeline with U.S. participation.\n\nThe European Union has expressed a lack of interest in restoring the pipeline's operation, and is reportedly preparing new sanctions against Russia. Nord Stream 2 AG has also faced legal and financial setbacks in Europe. In April 2025, a German court upheld a bank's decision to terminate the company's accounts due to U.S. sanctions risks. The company is operating under a moratorium on bankruptcy in Switzerland and has been making payments to small creditors to facilitate a larger financial settlement. One of the two pipeline strings was severely damaged in an attack in September 2022.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Nord Stream 2 AG remains on OFAC’s SDN list when checked on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration maintains or tightens Russia energy sanctions; no OFAC delisting occurs. Congress advances or passes tougher Russia energy measures (e.g., 500% tariff bill), and cabinet opposition prevails. On July 1, OFAC’s search tool still lists Nord Stream 2 AG.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "As part of a broader Ukraine settlement or negotiating gambit, the White House orders OFAC to delist Nord Stream 2 AG before July 1, 2025, despite European skepticism. OFAC publishes a delisting notice; on/after July 1 the SDN entry is absent.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: Nord Stream 2 AG is currently on the SDN list. Inertia and the short timeline favor “No.” Delistings of high-profile Russian energy assets typically require clear strategic rationale and interagency alignment, which is not evident.  \n- Recent signals against delisting: On May 2, Secretary of State Rubio called reports of considering delisting “unequivocally false.” Interior Secretary Burgum is also reportedly opposed. Reports on May 5 indicate the President is considering a bipartisan bill to impose 500% tariffs on importers of Russian energy and expand sanctions—political momentum is toward tightening, not loosening.  \n- International/political context: The EU shows no appetite to restore Nord Stream operations and is preparing additional sanctions. Nord Stream 2 AG faces adverse legal/financial rulings in Europe and remains under Swiss bankruptcy moratorium constraints; one pipeline string was damaged in 2022. Even if delisted, practical restart is implausible soon, weakening the incentive to expend political capital on delisting.  \n- Reasons the probability isn’t lower: Politico reported internal White House discussions (April 24) with a named proponent (Special Envoy Wietkoff) compiling energy sanctions options. There are proposals from investors and the former NS2 AG CEO to restart with U.S. participation. The administration can act unilaterally on OFAC designations, and Trump’s decision-making can be abrupt. A Ukraine settlement framework that trades energy sanctions relief for concessions could quickly shift policy.  \n- Reasons the probability isn’t higher: Strong, on-record denials by key principals; bipartisan appetite to escalate penalties on Russian energy; European resistance; minimal domestic upside and significant political risk in delisting a flagship Russian energy entity; and very little time left.  \n- What would move me up: Credible reporting of a Ukraine ceasefire/peace outline explicitly tying U.S. energy sanctions relief to concessions; public White House signaling softening on Russia energy; EU openness to some NS2-related accommodation; a draft OFAC notice or leak about delisting.  \n- What would move me down: Congressional advancement of the 500% tariff bill; further EU sanctions; additional cabinet/public statements reaffirming no delisting; any new Russian escalations that harden policy.  \nOverall, the weight of evidence and short timeline point to “No,” with a small tail risk of a negotiated delisting.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US lift its sanctions on Nord Stream 2 before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[White House debates lifting sanctions on Russian energy assets, Nord Stream](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/23/white-house-debating-lifting-sanctions-on-russian-energy-assets-00306486)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NORD STREAM 2 AG does not appear at Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) [Sanctions List Search tool](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it does appear on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN) List at that time, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\nAt the time of this question, the current listing of Nord Stream 2 by OFAC can be found [here](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=31926).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 2, 2025, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio explicitly denied a Politico report that the administration was considering lifting sanctions on Nord Stream 2, calling the claim 'unequivocally false.'

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
