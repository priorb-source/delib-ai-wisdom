  "information": "Donald Trump has a history of attending UFC events in the United States, typically appearing at 2 to 4 cards per year since 2019. All of his previous appearances have been at domestic events. He has a strong personal relationship with UFC President Dana White. Trump recently attended a UFC event in Miami in April 2025. Historically, he has not attended two consecutive numbered UFC cards within a one-month span; UFC 315 is scheduled to take place four weeks after the Miami event.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks. UFC 315 is scheduled for late May 2025, occurring four weeks after the Miami UFC event Trump attended in April 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Trump does NOT attend UFC 315. His typical attendance pattern is 2-4 UFC events per year out of approximately 40 annual events, representing a 5-10% base rate. He just attended an event in Miami and has never historically attended two consecutive numbered cards within a one-month span.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues his established pattern of selective UFC attendance as President. He maintains focus on presidential duties and other commitments, choosing not to attend UFC 315 so soon after the Miami event. His schedule as a sitting President makes back-to-back event attendance impractical, and he reserves his UFC appearances for more strategically timed or significant cards later in the year.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump makes an exception to his typical pattern, possibly due to a compelling main event (major title fight), convenient location near Mar-a-Lago or another Trump property, scheduling that aligns with other commitments, or political/strategic reasons. His close relationship with Dana White could facilitate a last-minute appearance if circumstances align.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors non-attendance. Trump attends only 2-4 UFC events annually from roughly 40 total events, translating to approximately 5-10% attendance. Three critical factors lower this probability further: (1) He just attended the Miami UFC event in April 2025, (2) He has never attended two consecutive numbered UFC cards within a one-month span according to the research, and (3) He is now serving as President, which significantly constrains his schedule compared to previous years. His strong personal relationship with Dana White is a factor in favor of attendance, but this hasn't historically led to frequent or consecutive event attendance. The question doesn't specify UFC 315's location, but given Trump's pattern of only attending domestic events, any international location would make attendance nearly impossible. For my forecast to increase, I would need evidence of: a particularly significant fight card, convenient timing/location (Mar-a-Lago area), or Trump breaking his historical pattern of event spacing. For it to decrease further, I would need confirmation of presidential commitments that conflict, international venue location, or explicit scheduling constraints. Given the strong status quo bias, recent Miami attendance, and historical pattern, I assess a 10% probability.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
