    "review": "Both forecasters correctly emphasize the page-dependent resolution risk: even if the policy persists, the question resolves No if the specific BC Hydro page drops the explicit Tesla mention. I agree with Forecaster 3 that broader market-share/protest context is secondary given the short horizon and page-based criterion. Forecaster 2’s 86% feels a bit high because it seems to underweight the nontrivial chance of a content reorg or shift to brand-agnostic wording by July 1. Forecaster 3’s 72% reflects a 25–30% communications-change risk, which I find plausible. New considerations I’m explicitly adopting from them: (1) the possibility of a temporary program pause or page revamp removing the Tesla call-out, and (2) the fact that a brand-agnostic update would resolve No regardless of underlying policy. These points reinforce, rather than overturn, my prior view.",
    "rationale": "(a) Time left: About 32 days until July 1, 2025.\n(b) Status quo: Since Mar 12, 2025, BC Hydro/CleanBC explicitly exclude Tesla products from rebates; the BC Hydro home charger page has called this out.\n(c) No outcome scenario: The rebate page is updated to brand-agnostic criteria (e.g., “U.S.-made goods excluded”), the page is reorganized or temporarily paused in a way that omits the explicit “Tesla not eligible” line, or a rapid policy reversal occurs (least likely in the short window). Any of these would lead to No under the resolution criteria if Tesla isn’t named on that page.\n(d) Yes outcome scenario: The policy persists (most likely) and the specific page continues to explicitly state that Tesla is not eligible on/after July 1.\n(e) Rationale: The underlying policy is newly announced, politically defended, and tied to a broader trade posture—reversal within a month looks unlikely. The dominant risk to a Yes resolution is a web content change that removes the brand-specific callout on the specified page. Given consumer-facing clarity needs and the short horizon, I think they are somewhat more likely to keep the explicit wording through early July, but the risk is meaningful. Roughly: P(policy persists by July 1) ≈ 90–95%; P(page still explicitly names Tesla | policy persists) ≈ 75–85%. That yields ~68–81% overall. I place myself near the upper-middle of that range, consistent with maintaining my prior forecast after considering the others’ arguments.\n(f) Forecast unchanged: The others’ analyses largely validate my previous calibration; I keep a modest buffer for page-update risk but see no strong reason to move materially up or down.",
