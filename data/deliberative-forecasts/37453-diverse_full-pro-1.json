    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement, with all forecasts falling between 5% and 10%. The consensus is that a 'Yes' outcome is highly unlikely due to procedural and political factors within the very short timeline. Forecaster 2 provided a helpful framework by breaking the process into three distinct sequential steps (submission, verification, announcement), which highlights the multiple points of potential delay. I found Forecaster 3's reasoning particularly compelling, as it introduced a crucial argument I had not fully weighted: the political incentive for Premier Smith to delay an announcement. The concept that keeping the referendum as a 'latent threat' preserves more negotiating leverage with the federal government than actually scheduling it is a powerful reason why the government would intentionally move slowly, even if a valid petition were submitted. This political consideration adds another significant barrier on top of the already challenging administrative timeline.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. My initial reasoning focused heavily on the compressed timeline and the administrative hurdles, specifically the time required for Elections Alberta to officially verify at least 177,000 signatures—a process that has not even begun. The other forecasters' analyses have reinforced this view. The key argument raised by Forecaster 3, regarding the political advantage for Premier Smith to delay an announcement to maintain leverage over the federal government, strengthens my conviction. It suggests that even if the administrative process were somehow expedited, there is a strong political disincentive for the government to rush to a formal announcement before the July 1, 2025 deadline. The Premier's own public statements point towards a potential 2026 referendum, signaling a longer, more deliberate timeline. The combination of the high procedural barrier and the strategic incentive for delay makes the 'Yes' scenario exceedingly improbable within the next 55 days. While I acknowledge Forecaster 2's point that rapid action is technically possible under extreme political pressure, the current evidence does not suggest such pressure exists at a level sufficient to override both bureaucratic inertia and political strategy. Therefore, a 5% probability remains the most reasonable assessment, accounting for a small chance of a black swan event while reflecting the overwhelming likelihood of the status quo prevailing.",
