  "information": "On May 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP). Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the decision was due to Harvard's repeated failure to comply with federal law and reporting requirements. The administration accused Harvard of fostering violence, antisemitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party. Other justifications cited by DHS included creating an 'unsafe environment' hostile to Jewish students, failing to address incidents of campus harassment, and not providing requested government information regarding the conduct of foreign students.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 34 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Courts decline to issue a TRO/preliminary injunction restoring SEVP status, or any injunction is stayed on appeal before July 1. DHS maintains revocation pending litigation/administrative appeal, or announces reinstatement effective after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A federal court issues a TRO or preliminary injunction ordering DHS/ICE to reinstate Harvard’s SEVP certification pending litigation, and DHS complies, or DHS voluntarily reverses and reinstates certification before or on July 1.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: On May 22, 2025, DHS revoked Harvard’s SEVP certification, citing noncompliance, campus safety/antisemitism concerns, and failure to provide information about foreign students (per the NYT reports summarized by the research assistant). As of May 28, the status quo is decertification, which means a No outcome if nothing changes.\n\n- Pathways to Yes: The most plausible near-term path is judicial relief. Harvard is highly likely to sue under the Administrative Procedure Act and constitutional theories (e.g., retaliation for protected speech/academic freedom), seeking a TRO/preliminary injunction. Courts often preserve the status quo when there is significant, immediate, irreparable harm—here, thousands of international students’ legal status and education. There is relevant institutional memory: in 2020, Harvard/MIT quickly obtained relief against an ICE policy restricting international students during COVID. While the facts differ, that episode shows how swiftly courts can act in SEVP-related disputes with large, concrete harms.\n\n- Countervailing factors: Immigration and national security domains receive executive deference, and the government can frame this as a compliance/public safety action. The administration may also seek immediate stays of any injunction in the circuit or at the Supreme Court. It’s also unclear whether any SEVP administrative appeal would automatically stay a revocation; absent a stay, administrative processes likely won’t resolve before July 1. Given the current political confrontation and unprecedented nature of pulling SEVP from a major university, DHS may resist reversal without a court order.\n\n- Weighing status quo vs. change: The status quo points to No, and deference to DHS is a real hurdle. However, the short horizon and high, concrete, and widespread irreparable harm to students make a TRO/PI relatively likely. Even if ultimate merits are uncertain, near-term judicial relief by July 1 is plausible. That nudges the forecast above 50% despite the current decertification.\n\n- Why not higher: Executive deference, the possibility of a rapid appellate stay of any district court order, and the administration’s willingness to escalate reduce confidence. Also, if DHS grounds the action in credible national security findings, courts may be more reluctant to intervene quickly.\n\n- Why not lower: The harm is immediate and large; courts often act to prevent disruption for thousands of students. A TRO restoring certification is a narrow, status-preserving remedy that courts can grant quickly. Harvard’s litigation capacity and public attention further increase odds of timely relief.\n\n- What would move me up: Harvard filing in a favorable venue and judge assignment; indications DHS will reconsider; reporting that an administrative appeal automatically stays revocation; any TRO/PI granted or even a scheduled expedited hearing before mid-June.\n\n- What would move me down: Court denial of TRO/PI; reports that appeals courts or SCOTUS are poised to stay any injunction; DHS publishing detailed evidence supporting emergency termination/national security grounds; signs of institutional noncompliance that undercut Harvard’s likelihood of success.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 22, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked Harvard University's certification for the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP).

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
