    "review": "The remarkable convergence of all three forecasts (28%, 30%, 30%) is striking and informative. All forecasters independently identified the same key factors: the 4-8 month median for African Starlink rollouts, the 2.5-month compressed timeline from licensing to deadline, the Bangladesh precedent showing rapid deployment is possible, and Somalia's current 'Not Available' status after one month. No new evidence was raised that I hadn't already considered - we all analyzed the same data points and reached essentially identical conclusions through independent reasoning. The clustering of independent expert forecasts around 30% actually serves as a validation signal rather than a reason to update. When multiple forecasters with access to identical information arrive at near-identical probabilistic estimates through different analytical paths, this suggests the estimate is well-calibrated to the available evidence. Each forecaster properly weighted the tension between the historical base rate (favoring 'No') and the possibility of expedited treatment (creating upside risk).",
    "rationale": "The convergence at 28-30% reinforces my confidence in the original forecast rather than suggesting a need to update. The key evidence remains: (1) Base rate strongly suggests 4-8 months for African deployments, making the 2.5-month window very tight; (2) Status quo after one month shows no movement toward 'Available' with only 6.5 weeks remaining; (3) Bangladesh demonstrates rapid deployment is technically possible when prioritized; (4) US diplomatic backing and Musk's announcement provide potential for acceleration. The 30% forecast appropriately captures a low but non-negligible probability that Somalia receives expedited treatment similar to Bangladesh, while respecting the strong base rate evidence suggesting the typical timeline will prevail. No forecaster identified overlooked evidence that would justify moving away from this consensus range.",
