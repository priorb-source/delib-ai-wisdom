  "information": "Incumbent Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, in office since 2003, has commenced his 2026 re-election campaign. He has secured endorsements from prominent party figures, including former President Donald Trump, Governor Henry McMaster, and Senator Tim Scott. On the Democratic side, Dr. Annie Andrews, a pediatrician who ran for a House seat in 2022, announced on May 29, 2025, that she would be a candidate in the 2026 Senate race.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with the deadline being July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Ralph Norman has not declared his candidacy, and the default outcome is that this state of affairs will continue past the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ralph Norman assesses the political landscape and concludes that a primary challenge against a well-funded incumbent with powerful endorsements, including from Donald Trump, is not viable. He forgoes an announcement before the July 1, 2025 deadline and continues his work in the House of Representatives.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Believing Senator Graham is vulnerable from the right despite high-profile endorsements, Ralph Norman launches a campaign in June 2025, positioning himself as the true conservative choice for South Carolina and hoping to galvanize grassroots support.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on three primary factors. First, the deadline is extremely close. As of May 30, 2025, there is only one month remaining until July 1, 2025. Launching a credible Senate primary challenge against a long-term incumbent typically requires a much longer runway for fundraising and organization. Second, the incumbent, Senator Lindsey Graham, has consolidated crucial support from the Republican establishment, most notably a key endorsement from former President Donald Trump. In a South Carolina GOP primary, this endorsement presents a formidable barrier for any challenger from the right, which is the lane Norman would occupy. Third, there has been no significant public activity from Norman, such as forming an exploratory committee, that would suggest an impending campaign launch. The status quo is that he is not a candidate, and with such a short time remaining, the status quo is the most probable outcome. My probability is not lower because Norman has a history of conservative opposition to the establishment, and a surprise entry, while unlikely, is not impossible. My probability is not higher due to the immense political capital of Senator Graham and the extremely disadvantageous timeline for launching a successful campaign.",
