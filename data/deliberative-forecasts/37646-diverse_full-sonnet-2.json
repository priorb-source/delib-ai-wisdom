    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the lack of visible progress after one full month post-license is particularly compelling - no ordering enabled, no reseller announcement, map still unchanged. This is a stronger negative indicator than I initially weighted. Forecaster 3's point about 2025 potentially having a faster deployment cadence is interesting but somewhat speculative. Forecaster 2's analysis is quite similar to mine, with their 35% being marginally more optimistic. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize Somalia's specific operational challenges (security, logistics, payments). The key insight I'm taking from this discussion is that we're already 40% through the available timeline (1 month of 2.5 months elapsed) with no public-facing progress whatsoever. Even in fast deployments, there are typically visible steps (ordering page launch, map updates, reseller announcements) that precede the map showing 'Available.' The absence of any such signals is concerning for meeting the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast modestly upward from 28% to 32%. My reasoning: The lack of progress in the first month is a stronger negative signal than I initially weighted. For Somalia to go 'Available' by July 1, we'd need ordering to launch within the next 2-3 weeks to allow time for logistics and fulfillment. The historical precedent remains clear - African rollouts typically take 4-8 months, and we only have 1.5 months remaining. However, I'm updating slightly upward (rather than downward) because: (1) the political momentum and public commitments create genuine pressure for speed; (2) the technical infrastructure via laser links is confirmed ready; (3) the Bangladesh precedent from May 2025 proves ultra-fast deployment is possible when conditions align; and (4) there may be behind-the-scenes progress not yet visible publically. The 32% forecast reflects that while a fast rollout remains plausible given the strong enabling factors, the lack of visible progress combined with Somalia's operational challenges makes it more likely that launch will slip beyond July 1, similar to the pattern seen in Zambia, India, and Vietnam.",
