    "review": "Both forecasters provide well-reasoned analyses that converge on very low probabilities (2% and 7%). Forecaster 3 raises an important operational point about the resolution criteria - only actual removal from the SDN List counts, not waivers or rhetoric. This clarification doesn't change the analysis but ensures we're measuring the right outcome. Forecaster 3 also introduces an interesting 'technical delisting' scenario if Nord Stream 2 AG is formally dissolved in Switzerland, though OFAC typically maintains posthumous listings. Forecaster 2's emphasis on Congressional momentum toward expanding (not easing) sanctions reinforces the directional trend away from lifting sanctions. The most compelling shared argument is the combination of the May 2 'unequivocally false' denial from Rubio (just 4 days ago), the May 5 reports of considering expanded sanctions, and the compressed 55-day timeframe. These recent developments are stronger evidence than I initially weighted. While I acknowledged these factors, Forecaster 2's more conservative 2% better reflects how substantial and recent these barriers are. The denials aren't months old or tentative - they're explicit, recent, and from the Secretary of State himself.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast downward from 7% to 4%. The key factors driving this revision are: (1) The May 2 denial from Rubio using 'unequivocally false' language is extraordinarily strong and occurred just days ago, making a rapid reversal even more unlikely than I initially assessed; (2) The May 5 reports of expanding sanctions represent the most recent directional signal, moving away from lifting sanctions; (3) The 55-day timeframe is extremely compressed for such a high-profile reversal, especially one requiring overcoming explicit recent denials and cabinet-level opposition. I'm not going as low as 2% because: (1) Trump administration foreign policy has proven capable of surprising pivots; (2) The April 24 Politico report confirms internal discussions occurred, suggesting this isn't completely off the table; (3) A technical delisting scenario, while unlikely, provides a non-zero pathway; (4) An unexpected Ukraine settlement breakthrough could theoretically change the calculus rapidly. The 4% forecast balances the very strong recent evidence against lifting sanctions with residual uncertainty around Trump unpredictability and potential surprise diplomatic developments.",
