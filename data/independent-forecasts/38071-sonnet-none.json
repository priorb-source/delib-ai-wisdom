    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "21 days until the Democratic primary on June 17, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The outcome is highly uncertain. In a multi-candidate Democratic primary without polling data or detailed candidate information, no single candidate should be strongly favored as the status quo.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One or more other Democratic candidates running in the primary receive more votes than Aaron Rouse on June 17, 2025. This could occur if the field includes well-funded opponents with stronger name recognition, better endorsements, or more effective campaigns that successfully mobilize voters in the final three weeks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Aaron Rouse successfully wins the most votes in the June 17, 2025 Democratic primary for lieutenant governor. This would likely require him to have established campaign infrastructure, secured key endorsements, maintained fundraising momentum, and effectively mobilized his base of support across Virginia to turn out on primary day.",
    "rationale": "With only 21 days until the primary and no additional information from my research assistant about polling, candidate field composition, endorsements, or campaign dynamics, I must rely on baseline reasoning. The fact that Aaron Rouse is specifically named in a forecasting question suggests he is a notable, viable candidate in this race - not a fringe contender. However, Virginia Democratic primaries for down-ballot offices like lieutenant governor can be competitive with multiple serious candidates. Without evidence of Rouse leading in polls, having a significant fundraising advantage, or securing major endorsements, I cannot assign a high probability to his victory. Conversely, his apparent viability (evidenced by this question existing) prevents me from assigning a very low probability. In a typical competitive Democratic primary with 3-4 serious candidates, base rates would suggest probabilities in the 25-40% range for any given candidate. I'm forecasting 35% as a moderate probability that acknowledges Rouse as a serious contender while reflecting substantial uncertainty about the race dynamics. My forecast would increase with evidence of: polling leads, major endorsements, fundraising advantages, or opponents dropping out. It would decrease with evidence of: trailing in polls, stronger opponents, campaign problems, or a larger candidate field diluting support. The very short time horizon (21 days) means the race dynamics are likely already substantially determined, though final mobilization efforts can still matter.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
