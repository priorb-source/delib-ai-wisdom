    "review": "The other two forecasters have reached the same conclusion as I have, for virtually identical reasons. We are in strong agreement that the ongoing civil war in Sudan is the overwhelmingly dominant factor. They correctly identify the lack of a functioning, unified government and legislature, the focus of all state-like actors on the conflict, and the extremely short timeline (less than one month) as making the ratification of the AfCFTA agreement a near impossibility. Their reasoning is highly convincing and aligns perfectly with my own initial assessment. No new evidence or arguments were raised that I had not already considered.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of the other forecasters, my reasoning remains unchanged, and my confidence in my initial forecast is reinforced by the strong consensus. The deliberation process did not introduce any new information or counterarguments that would warrant an update. The core logic stands: Sudan is in the midst of a devastating civil war that has paralyzed all normal state functions. Ratifying an international treaty requires a stable, internationally recognized legislative and executive branch, neither of which currently exists in a functional capacity. With the deadline of July 1, 2025, less than a month away, the sequence of events required for a 'Yes' outcome—a durable peace agreement, the formation of a unified government, and the prioritization and completion of the ratification process—is not credible. I am maintaining my forecast of 1% to account for unpredictable, highly improbable 'black swan' events, a sentiment shared by the other forecasters.",
