    "review": "Forecaster 2’s logic mirrors mine: short runway to the deadline, net cash, positive FCF, and no near-term maturities make a filing very unlikely; the only near-term catalyst is an adverse Q1 print. Forecaster 3 adds a base-rate framing and the possibility of a “strategic” Chapter 11, but doesn’t cite concrete triggers (covenants, advisor hires, going‑concern language, imminent delisting) that would force such a move in 57 days. I find F2’s 3% aligned with the evidence; F3’s 10% seems high absent signs of acute liquidity stress or creditor pressure.",
    "rationale": "Key points unchanged: Chegg has several hundred million in net cash, positive free cash flow, and no large maturities before 2026. An NYSE price deficiency can be addressed via a reverse split and carries a six-month cure period, making delisting-driven stress before July 1 unlikely. Management is pursuing cost cuts and strategic alternatives, which are more consistent with M&A/privatization than with a near-term Chapter 11. The only realistic near-term catalysts are the May 12 earnings and any disclosures thereof (cash burn, guidance, going-concern warning, covenant issues, or hiring restructuring advisors). In the absence of those, a bankruptcy filing in the next ~57 days remains a tail risk. I do not see new evidence from the other forecasters that raises that tail materially; thus I keep my estimate. I would revise sharply upward only on concrete signals of liquidity/covenant stress or restructuring preparations; I would revise downward if Q1 confirms solid liquidity/FCF and no going-concern language.",
