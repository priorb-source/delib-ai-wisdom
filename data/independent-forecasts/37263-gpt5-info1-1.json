  "information": "In April 2025, the Ministry of Tourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) warned tourism stakeholders against promoting or facilitating the use of illegal taxis, with businesses facing a $1000 fine for such referrals. The government has emphasized that operating an unlicensed taxi is a serious offense, with penalties for drivers including a fine and disqualification from driving. The country, with a resident population of approximately 45,000, has also implemented a new \"Rate Your Ride\" framework. As of May 2025, two locally-based ride-hailing services are confirmed to be operating: GetMe Ride, which launched in 2019, and Conch Cab, which began service in May 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "TCI maintains strict enforcement against unlicensed taxis, no regulatory accommodation for e-hailing occurs, and Uber neither announces nor lists Turks and Caicos on its site; local apps (GetMe Ride, Conch Cab) continue to serve demand.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Uber rapidly secures a compliant model (e.g., partners with licensed taxi operators), announces a launch or pilot on Providenciales, and updates its website to list Turks and Caicos; credible local or Uber sources report availability by July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The base rate for Uber entering a new, small island market on a 60-day horizon without prior signaling is low. Turks and Caicos (~45k residents, tourism-driven) is attractive on visitor spend but small in scale, which historically limits Uber’s near-term expansion priority. The April 2025 government warning against illegal taxis and $1,000 fines for referrals indicates a protective, enforcement-oriented stance toward unlicensed ride services; this increases the likelihood that any Uber entry would require using licensed taxis, coordination with regulators, and driver onboarding—hard to complete by July 1. The presence of two local ride-hailing services (GetMe Ride since 2019; Conch Cab launched May 2025) shows demand for app-based rides but also suggests the regulatory space is being filled by local, presumably compliant operators. These factors make the status quo (No) more likely. Not higher: No public signals from Uber (press, job postings, city pages), short timeline, small market, and current regulatory posture. Not lower: It’s still possible Uber launches a compliant taxi-partner model quickly, especially in a tourism-heavy locale, and a single announcement plus website update would satisfy resolution criteria. What would move me up: Official Uber announcements or support pages listing Turks and Caicos; credible local reporting of a formal partnership with licensed taxi associations; regulatory guidance explicitly permitting e-hailing with licensed taxis; Uber job postings or operational hiring in TCI. What would move me down: Continued or escalated enforcement rhetoric, explicit government statements ruling out Uber-like platforms, or taxi association opposition paired with no signaling from Uber by early June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Uber be available in the Turks and Caicos Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tourism Stakeholders Warned About Encouraging Use of Illegal Taxis](https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/tourism-stakeholders-warned-about-encouraging-use-of-illegal-taxis/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Uber is available in Turks and Caicos as shown on the [Uber website](https://www.uber.com/us/en/search-results/?query=TURKS+AND+CAICOS) or according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn April 2025, the Ministry of Tourism in the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) warned tourism stakeholders against promoting or facilitating the use of illegal taxis, with businesses facing a $1000 fine for such referrals.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
