  "information": "The most recent post on Virgin Galactic's News page was dated January 30, 2025. The post before that was from December 12, 2024. Over the 10 complete months leading up to May 2025, five months contained at least one post. There was a four-month gap in posts from August to October 2024, and a three-month gap from February to April 2025.\n\nVirgin Galactic announced it will release its financial results for the first quarter of 2025 on Thursday, May 15, 2025, followed by a conference call. The company's Q4 2024 earnings release on February 26, 2025, was not posted on the main News page, nor was the press release announcing the date for the Q1 2025 results. These communications were issued via the Investor Relations section and PR wires.\n\nThe company is in a flight hiatus, with no crewed flights scheduled until 2026. The next generation of spaceplanes, the Delta SpaceShip, began assembly in March 2025. Commercial flights for this new craft are planned to begin in mid-2026, with private astronaut flights following in the fall of 2026. According to a regulatory filing, Geode Capital Management LLC increased its stake in Virgin Galactic by 19.1% during the fourth quarter of 2024.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — no new posts appear on Virgin Galactic’s News page in May 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic publishes at least one News page item in May (e.g., a Delta SpaceShip assembly milestone, partnership announcement, leadership/change management news, or a corporate blog-style update; or they choose to cross-post Q1 results or a recap to the News page).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic remains in flight hiatus, shares updates only via Investor Relations/PR wires and social channels, and the News page receives no new entries throughout May.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and base rates: The assistant’s research indicates the last News page post was Jan 30, 2025, with the prior on Dec 12, 2024. Over the last 10 complete months, only 5 months had any post, and there have been multi-month gaps (four-month gap in 2024; three-month gap Feb–Apr 2025). This supports a meaningful chance of another quiet month. \n- Catalysts: The only dated May item is the Q1 2025 earnings release and call on May 15. Recent precedent is that earnings communications were not placed on the main News page (handled via IR and PR wires), lowering the odds that this scheduled event produces a News post. The company is in a crewed-flight hiatus until 2026, reducing newsworthy operational events. While Delta vehicle assembly began in March, there is no specific signal of an imminent News-page milestone update in May. \n- Status quo weighting: Given a three-month dry spell on the News page and no clear May catalyst typically posted to News, the status quo favors no new posts. \n- Why not higher: Corporate comms sometimes post mid-cycle updates (manufacturing milestones, partnerships, leadership changes). Roughly half of recent months had at least one post, so a post in May is plausible even without flights. A decision to cross-post an earnings recap or a Delta progress note could flip this. \n- Why not lower: The flight hiatus and recent pattern of silence, plus prior earnings not appearing on the News page, collectively make a quiet May more likely than not. \n- What would move me upward (toward more ‘Yes’): Additional signs of continued comms minimalism (e.g., May IR materials again not mirrored on News; no social/media teasers of News content by mid-May). \n- What would move me downward (toward more ‘No’): Any pre-announced media day, factory/Delta milestone timing aligned to May, visible comms push, website refresh patterns, or indications they will start cross-posting IR content to News.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe most recent post on Virgin Galactic's News page was dated January 30, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
