  "information": "According to the U.S. Department of Labor, initial jobless claims for the week ending May 31, 2025, rose by 8,000 to 247,000, the highest level in eight months. The figure for the prior week was revised to 239,000. The four-week moving average increased to 235,000, the highest since November 2021. For the week ending May 24, the number of continuing claims was 1.904 million, a slight decrease of 3,000 from the previous week.\n\nBroader labor market indicators suggest a softening trend. A report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas showed that U.S.-based employers announced 93,816 job cuts in May, which is 47% higher than in May 2024. Separately, the ADP employment report revealed that only 37,000 jobs were created in the private sector in May, the lowest figure in a year. Both the Federal Reserve's Beige Book report and an Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey pointed to weakening conditions, with widespread comments about economic uncertainty delaying new hiring.\n\nThe recent rise in jobless claims was not uniform across the country. The largest increases in initial claims for the week ending May 31 were in Michigan, Nebraska, California, Florida, and Virginia. The largest decreases were reported in Massachusetts, Illinois, Texas, Washington, and New York. Several major corporations have announced layoffs in 2025, including Procter & Gamble, Microsoft, Citigroup, Walmart, Meta, and Disney.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3 weeks. The data for the week ending June 21, 2025, is typically released on the following Thursday, June 26, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The most recent data for the week ending May 31, 2025, was 247,000, and the four-week moving average was 235,000, both of which are above the 220,000 threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recent increase in claims proves to be a temporary spike caused by isolated layoff events. Unexpectedly strong economic news in early June encourages businesses to retain staff and resume hiring, causing claims to fall back below the 220,000 level for the week in question.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The current trend of a softening labor market continues. The cumulative effect of previously announced corporate layoffs continues to be reflected in the data, and weak economic conditions prevent a significant rebound in hiring, keeping initial claims elevated above the 220,000 threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong evidence of a cooling labor market, with initial jobless claims as a primary indicator. The status quo strongly supports a 'Yes' outcome. The most recent weekly claim figure of 247,000 and the four-week moving average of 235,000 are both comfortably above the 220,000 threshold. This is not an isolated signal; it is corroborated by a range of other indicators mentioned in the research report. These include a 47% year-over-year increase in announced job cuts, a very weak ADP private sector employment report, and pessimistic outlooks from the Federal Reserve's Beige Book and ISM surveys. The wave of layoffs from major corporations like Microsoft, Walmart, and Meta further suggests this trend will persist in the short term. The probability is not higher than 75% because initial claims are a volatile, high-frequency data series, and a single week's number can swing significantly. A few large states reporting better figures could pull the national number down. The probability is not lower because the breadth of corroborating evidence points to a systemic softening rather than a temporary anomaly. For me to lower my forecast, the next two weekly claims reports would need to show a sharp and sustained decline back towards the 220,000 level. Conversely, I would raise my forecast if we see further acceleration in claims or news of another major round of large-scale layoffs.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 exceed 220,000?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer. The claim requests a determination of basic eligibility for the Unemployment Insurance program.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 is greater than 220,000 according to [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA).&#x20;\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, initial jobless claims for the week ending May 31, 2025, rose by 8,000 to 247,000, the highest level in eight months.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
