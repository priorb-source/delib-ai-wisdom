  "information": "The Scottish Government has issued guidance advising against significant or high-profile government announcements between May 15 and June 5, 2025, due to a by-election campaign in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency. Separately, tens of thousands of Scottish council workers are being balloted on strike action, with the vote closing on June 12. Public opinion polls on independence are mixed; while one poll showed an 11-point lead for 'Yes,' other sources from late April 2025 indicate polling remains in the 45-55% range against independence, with one citing 54% opposition.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish Government continues its current stance of not unilaterally scheduling a referendum without UK consent, focuses on domestic governance and upcoming elections, observes pre-election guidance limiting high‑profile announcements in mid-May to early June, and makes no dated referendum announcement before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish Government publicly names a specific date for a consultative independence referendum (potentially alongside a draft bill or government paper), despite UK-level opposition, similar to the 2022 tactic of announcing a date pending legal/political resolution. The announced date could be well in the future; the legality would be contested but the announcement itself would satisfy the question’s criteria.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The world changes slowly and the institutional and political obstacles to scheduling a Scottish independence referendum are substantial. Since the 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling, the Scottish Government has shown caution about unilateral moves. With a UK Labour government opposed to a Section 30 order and the SNP governing without a stable pro‑independence majority arrangement, the status quo strongly points to no dated referendum announcement in the next two months.\n\nPrecedent and possibility: In 2022, the Scottish Government did announce a specific referendum date while legality was unresolved, so a non‑zero probability remains that they could reprise a symbolic announcement to energize their base. However, the political context has since shifted toward caution and refocusing on domestic issues after difficult electoral cycles. Announcing a date now would incur legal/political costs without clear strategic benefit before the 2026 Holyrood election.\n\nTiming constraints: The window is short. Your assistant notes Scottish Government guidance discouraging significant announcements May 15–June 5 due to a by‑election, reducing practical days for a high‑profile intervention. Even outside that period, logistics and messaging discipline argue against a sudden pivot.\n\nPolling: While one poll shows an 11‑point Yes lead, other late‑April reads remain roughly 45–55 against. A mixed polling environment weakens the incentive for an immediate, confrontational scheduling announcement.\n\nWhy not higher: Lack of Westminster consent, legal headwinds, minority‑government dynamics, a short window, and no clear strategic gain make a dated announcement before July 1 unlikely. Party messaging has tended to emphasize mandates via elections rather than unilateral referendums post‑2022.\n\nWhy not lower: The 2022 precedent proves that the Scottish Government can announce a date even amid legal uncertainty; a sudden pro‑independence surge or intra‑party/grassroots pressure could trigger a symbolic move. The question resolves Yes even if Westminster declares it illegal, so a purely political announcement would suffice.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of a new draft Referendum Bill with an explicit date; senior Scottish ministers signaling imminent scheduling; a sustained, sizable Yes polling lead (e.g., several polls with 55–60% Yes); coalition or confidence‑and‑supply developments tying support to a dated referendum; or a strategic set‑piece speech/paper foreshadowing a scheduled consultative vote.\n\nWhat would move me down: Explicit government statements ruling out any referendum scheduling before 2026; legislative focus that crowds out constitutional initiatives; further guidance extending the announcement moratorium; or fresh political costs (e.g., fiscal or public‑service crises) making such an announcement even less attractive.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Scottish Government has issued guidance advising against significant or high-profile government announcements between May 15 and June 5, 2025, due to a by-election campaign in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
