    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identified the central tension of this question: the overwhelming logistical and scheduling improbability of a presidential visit versus Donald Trump's penchant for unconventional, last-minute diplomacy. We all agree on the core evidence points — the lack of advance preparations, the tight timeline, and the conflicting travel schedules of both leaders. Forecaster 2's analysis was particularly persuasive in its conclusion. While my reasoning and Forecaster 3's were very similar in assigning a 10% probability, Forecaster 2's lower 2% forecast forced me to critically re-evaluate how much weight I was giving to the 'unpredictability' factor. Forecaster 2 rightly framed the logistical hurdles as nearly insurmountable, not just difficult. His emphasis that the phrase 'to be announced later' is strong evidence against imminence was a subtle but important point I had not fully weighed. This has convinced me that my initial 10% was too high and underweighted the hard constraints of reality.",
    "rationale": "My initial analysis, like that of the other forecasters, centered on the significant logistical barriers to arranging a presidential visit to China within the 15-day timeframe. After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain this core reasoning but have adjusted the weight I assign to the competing factors. The consensus is that such a visit, which normally requires weeks or months of security and diplomatic preparation, is extremely unlikely given the complete absence of any reported advance work and the very tight travel schedules for both President Trump and President Xi. My initial 10% forecast acknowledged Trump's history of surprise diplomatic moves. However, I now believe I overestimated the chance that his personal style could overcome such formidable, real-world constraints. Forecaster 2's argument for a very low probability was convincing, prompting me to revise my estimate downwards. I am lowering my forecast from 10% to 5%. This change reflects a greater appreciation for the near-impossibility of the logistics involved. A 5% chance still accounts for a highly improbable, hastily arranged signing ceremony driven by the urgency of the trade deal, but it more accurately reflects that this would be an extraordinary exception to standard operating procedure, rather than just an unconventional move.",
