    "review": "The other two forecasters reached the exact same conclusion as I did, for the same reasons. We all agree that the ongoing civil war in Sudan is the single most important factor, making normal state functions like treaty ratification impossible. All three of us noted the lack of a functioning legislature and the extreme time constraint, with less than a month until the deadline. Their reasoning is highly convincing and aligns perfectly with my own assessment. No new evidence or arguments were raised that I had not already considered; the consensus simply reinforces the extreme unlikelihood of a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of the other forecasters, my reasoning remains unchanged. My confidence in my initial forecast of 1% is strengthened by the strong consensus. The core argument is unshakable: Sudan is embroiled in a devastating civil war that has collapsed its state institutions. Ratifying a major international agreement requires a stable, functioning government and legislature, neither of which currently exists. The deadline of July 1, 2025, is less than a month away, leaving no plausible amount of time for the necessary conditions—a comprehensive peace deal, the formation of a unified government, and the execution of the legislative process—to materialize. The other forecasters rightfully pointed out that pre-war momentum on this issue is now irrelevant. Since no new arguments or evidence have been presented to suggest a viable path to ratification, I will not update my forecast.",
