    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 4–6 months (UFC 316 is expected in the second half of 2025; exact date/location not yet publicly confirmed).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — for any specific UFC PPV, Trump typically does not attend.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "UFC 316 is held outside the U.S. (e.g., Abu Dhabi, U.K., Australia) or in a U.S. city he rarely attends, or a scheduling/security issue keeps him away.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "UFC 316 takes place in Las Vegas, Miami, New York/New Jersey, or another major U.S. market he favors, and he makes a public appearance cageside or elsewhere on the venue grounds.",
    "rationale": "Evidence: Trump has a well-documented relationship with Dana White and has attended multiple UFC PPVs over the past few years, including after taking office (NYT reports he attended a UFC event in Miami in April 2025). Historically, he attends several but not most PPVs. A rough base rate from 2023–2025 suggests something like 2–4 attendances per year out of ~12 PPVs, implying ≈15–30% per event, conditional on U.S. location. The unknowns here are date and location of UFC 316. If it’s in a friendly U.S. market (Vegas/Miami/NYC/NJ), the chance is meaningfully higher; if it’s international, the chance is very low. Given a mixed recent pattern of U.S. vs. international PPVs, a blended estimate lands in the high teens to mid-20s. I place extra weight on the status quo (No) since he still skips most specific cards. Not higher: Many PPVs are international or in less convenient markets, and even in the U.S. he doesn’t attend the majority; presidential schedule/security can also preclude attendance. Not lower: He has recently attended as sitting president, clearly enjoys the optics, and UFC leadership is welcoming; if 316 is in Vegas/Miami/NYC/NJ, attendance becomes quite plausible. Updaters upward: official location/date announcement in a favored U.S. market; public hints from Trump/Dana White; presence of close allies/fighters on the card; 316 aligning with other travel he’s already making. Updaters downward: 316 announced for Abu Dhabi/UK/Australia or another international site; conflicting presidential commitments or security concerns; negative health/news cycles limiting optional appearances. Research assistant provided no extra info; thus I rely on base rates and observed behavior.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend UFC 316?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Trump and Some of His Cabinet Members Attend U.F.C. Fight in Miami](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/trump-ufc-fight-reyes.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if President Donald Trump is anywhere within the grounds of the venue where [UFC 316](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-316) takes place. Otherwise this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
