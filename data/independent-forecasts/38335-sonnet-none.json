    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 26 days remain until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement - Casey DeSantis has not announced her candidacy as of June 5, 2025, and if current patterns continue, she will not announce before the July 1 deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis declines to run for governor, influenced by Trump's endorsement of Byron Donalds, unfavorable polling showing her losing ground to Donalds, and the challenging political landscape. She never makes a formal announcement before July 1, 2025",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite political headwinds, Casey DeSantis decides to proceed with her gubernatorial campaign and makes an official announcement in the remaining 26 days before July 1, 2025, potentially positioning herself as an independent alternative to Trump's preferred candidate",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires weighing several key factors. First, the timeframe is extremely short - only 26 days remain. Second, Casey DeSantis has not yet announced despite presumably having had months to consider and prepare for a gubernatorial run. This non-announcement is itself significant information. Third, the political environment appears challenging: the poll indicates Trump has endorsed Byron Donalds, who is now surging ahead of her. In Florida Republican politics, Trump's endorsement carries enormous weight, creating a substantial obstacle to her candidacy. The status quo strongly favors a 'No' outcome - she hasn't announced yet, and good forecasters recognize that the world changes slowly and the status quo persists most of the time. Major gubernatorial campaigns typically announce well in advance, and we're already in June 2025 for what would presumably be a 2026 race. The research assistant provided no information suggesting an imminent announcement, no reports of campaign infrastructure being built, and no signals from her team about candidacy plans. Why not lower than 18%? Because 26 days is still technically sufficient time for a political announcement, and politicians can make decisions relatively quickly when circumstances change. We lack definitive information ruling out an announcement entirely. Why not higher? The combination of no announcement yet, minimal time remaining, unfavorable Trump endorsement of her opponent, and poor polling creates substantial barriers. To update upward, I would need news reports of imminent announcement plans, campaign preparation activities, or statements from her team. To update downward, I would need explicit statements ruling out a run or simply more days passing without announcement",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Casey DeSantis announce her candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Poll: Trump's endorsement boosts Byron Donalds over Casey DeSantis for Florida governor](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/05/09/poll-byron-donalds-surges-past-casey-desantis-with-trump-backing/83412367007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Casey DeSantis announces her candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
