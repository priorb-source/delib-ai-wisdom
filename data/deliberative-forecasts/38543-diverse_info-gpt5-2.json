    "review": "Forecaster 2 rightly emphasizes the logistical and protocol hurdles and notes political will as a counterweight. However, their claim that both sides have publicly confirmed a visit feels overstated based on what we have; I’ve seen references to leaders’ approval being needed, not a confirmed China trip. Their 20% seems high given the lack of any advance signs. Forecaster 3 adds useful (if unverified) scheduling constraints and reinforces the absence of visible prep (advance teams, press guidance), which is the strongest evidence for a low probability. Even if some of their specific calendar items aren’t confirmed, the general point stands: late-June is crowded and a China visit would be conspicuous in planning signals. I find F3’s reasoning more persuasive overall.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is about 16 days. The status quo strongly favors No: there are no credible reports of a pending China trip, no visible advance work, and such a visit typically requires significant and public preparation. While the tariff timeline and a putative deal create an incentive for a leader-level moment, in-person approval in China isn’t required; a call, a signing in Washington, or a third-country venue would meet the political need with far fewer logistical hurdles. Trump’s propensity for surprise trips marginally raises the tail risk, but China visits are high-protocol and less amenable to short-notice secrecy than battlefield or border photo-ops. I previously had 8%; incorporating the additional emphasis on scheduling conflicts and the continued absence of any signals, I lower slightly. I would move up only on credible reporting of a late-June China stop (MFA/White House announcements, press pool notices, or sightings of U.S. advance teams in China).",
