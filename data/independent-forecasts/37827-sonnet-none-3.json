    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days. We are currently on May 22, 2025, and the question resolves after July 1, 2025, once NUFORC data for June 2025 can be verified.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - if current patterns continue, it is more likely that no pilot report from Africa appears in June 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No pilots flying over African countries in June 2025 observe unusual aerial phenomena, or if they do, they choose not to report to NUFORC. Alternatively, any reports submitted are delayed in posting or don't meet the specific criteria (not identified as pilot reports, not clearly from Africa, or not dated in June).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial, private, or military pilot operating in African airspace during June 2025 observes an unexplained aerial phenomenon and files a report with NUFORC, which is then posted to their database with proper attribution indicating it came from a pilot in an African country during June 2025.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant provided no additional data on historical base rates for African pilot UFO reports to NUFORC, which is a significant limitation. However, the background information confirms such reports do occur - the Rwanda example from January 2025 demonstrates that pilots in Africa do report to NUFORC. Key considerations: (1) NUFORC is a US-based reporting center, so international reports, particularly from Africa, likely represent a small fraction of total submissions. (2) Pilot reports are inherently rarer than general public reports since pilots represent a tiny subset of the population. (3) Africa has lower commercial aviation density compared to North America and Europe. (4) The time window is narrow - only one month. (5) However, the existence of the Rwanda report shows this isn't impossible. Without knowing the actual base rate, I must estimate conservatively. If African pilot reports occur perhaps a few times per year, the probability for any given month would be low but non-negligible. My forecast is not higher because: pilot reports from Africa appear to be rare events, and we lack evidence of frequent occurrence. My forecast is not lower because: we have proof such reports do happen, Africa is a large continent with multiple countries and flight operations, and we only need one report in a 30-day window. To update upward, I would need evidence of more frequent African pilot reports or increased aviation activity. To update downward, I would need data showing African pilot reports are extremely rare (less than 1-2 per year).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
