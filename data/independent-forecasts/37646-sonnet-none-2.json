    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 47 days (from May 15, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Somalia is not currently listed as available on the Starlink map, as indicated by the resolution criteria not yet being satisfied",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the license announcement, SpaceX encounters delays in actual service deployment due to infrastructure requirements, regulatory finalization, business timing decisions, or operational considerations. The gap between licensing and updating the availability map proves longer than the 47 days remaining.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following Musk's license announcement, SpaceX moves swiftly to finalize regulatory requirements and operational setup. With the hardest regulatory step (licensing) already cleared, the company updates their availability map within the next 47 days to reflect Somalia as an available market.",
    "rationale": "This forecast weighs several competing factors. On the positive side, Elon Musk has publicly announced securing a Starlink license for Somalia, which represents a significant regulatory milestone. Public announcements from Musk typically indicate serious commitment, and updating a website to show availability is operationally straightforward once regulatory approval is secured. The 47-day timeframe, while tight, is sufficient for website updates if the decision is made. On the negative side, status quo bias is important here - the criteria explicitly state Somalia is not yet shown as available despite the license announcement, suggesting a gap between licensing and actual service availability. Historical precedent shows that regulatory approvals don't always immediately translate to service launches. There may be infrastructure requirements (ground stations, local partnerships), business considerations about timing, or additional regulatory steps beyond just licensing. The relatively short 47-day window increases uncertainty. My forecast is not higher (75-85%) because there's no confirmation of imminent deployment, no evidence of ground infrastructure setup, and no official Starlink announcement of pending availability beyond Musk's license statement. It's not lower (35-45%) because the license is already secured (the major hurdle), Musk's public commitment carries weight, and 47 days provides reasonable time for a determined effort. To update higher, I would need: confirmation of imminent launch dates, evidence of infrastructure deployment, or official Starlink announcements. To update lower: news of regulatory complications, technical obstacles, or longer deployment timelines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Somalia as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Musk announces Starlink license for Somalia](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Musk_announces_Starlink_license_for_Somalia_999.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Somalia listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
