  "information": "A series of polls conducted between March and June 2025 show Andrew Cuomo as the frontrunner in the Democratic primary. A SurveyUSA poll in May showed Cuomo as the first choice for 43% of likely Democratic voters, with Zohran Mamdani at 11%. A Marist poll from early May placed Cuomo at 37% and Mamdani at 18%, and a simulation showed Cuomo surpassing the 50% threshold to win in the fifth round of ranked-choice voting. An Emerson College/PIX11/The Hill poll from late May placed Cuomo at 39% to Mamdani's 23%. Earlier polls from March by Honan Strategy Group and Data for Progress also showed Cuomo leading Mamdani with 41% to 18% and 39% to 15%, respectively.\n\nAndrew Cuomo has secured endorsements from several key groups and individuals. These include Luis Dávila Pernas, the chairman of the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico; Latin music star Marc Anthony; and several Orthodox Jewish communities, including the Bobov Hasidic movement, the Crown Heights community, and the Far Rockaway Jewish Alliance. In contrast, Cuomo's primary opponent, Zohran Mamdani, has received the endorsement of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nFinancially, Cuomo's campaign is supported by the New York Apartment Association, which plans to spend $2.5 million on his behalf. His campaign has also run ads targeting Hispanic voters, including a $100,000 ad buy related to the Puerto Rican Day Parade. In a recent debate, all nine Democratic candidates, including Cuomo and Mamdani, were united in their pledge to protect immigrants and maintain New York's status as a sanctuary city. In a separate strategic move, Cuomo announced the founding of his own independent party, 'Fight and Deliver', while remaining in the Democratic primary race.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "15 days until the June 24, 2025 Democratic primary",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Andrew Cuomo wins the Democratic primary based on his consistent and substantial polling lead",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Zohran Mamdani's recent momentum continues explosively in the final two weeks, or a major scandal emerges involving Cuomo that dramatically shifts voter sentiment. The ranked-choice voting system could also produce an unexpected consolidation of anti-Cuomo voters around Mamdani in later rounds.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cuomo maintains his current polling advantage through election day. His 16-point lead in the most recent poll holds, and the Marist simulation proving accurate - he surpasses 50% in the fifth round of ranked-choice voting, securing the Democratic nomination as polls have consistently predicted.",
    "rationale": "The polling evidence strongly supports a Cuomo victory. He has led every poll from March through late May by substantial margins (16-32 points), demonstrating both consistency and durability. The SurveyUSA poll from May showed him at 43% versus Mamdani's 11%, and the most recent Emerson poll has him at 39% to Mamdani's 23%. Critically, the Marist poll included a ranked-choice voting simulation showing Cuomo exceeding the 50% threshold in the fifth round, directly addressing the complexity of NYC's voting system. His campaign advantages are substantial: $2.5 million in outside spending from the New York Apartment Association, strategic ad buys targeting Hispanic voters, and key endorsements from Latino community leaders (Marc Anthony, Puerto Rico Democratic Party chair) and Orthodox Jewish communities. However, several factors prevent a forecast above 80%: Mamdani has shown momentum, growing from 11% in early polls to 23% in late May. AOC's endorsement could energize progressive turnout. Cuomo's controversial resignation history remains a vulnerability. Ranked-choice voting can produce surprises, and 15 days is enough time for significant developments. Two weeks before an election, while the status quo heavily favors Cuomo, uncertainty remains around turnout, late-breaking news, and the ranked-choice dynamics with nine candidates. For my forecast to move higher, I'd need to see June polls confirming Cuomo's lead and no major negative developments. For it to move lower, I'd need evidence of Mamdani closing within single digits or signs of an anti-Cuomo coalition forming.",
