    "review": "The other two forecasters reached the same 30% probability as my initial assessment, and their reasoning is highly convergent with my own. We all identified the same core tension: the official diplomatic signaling versus the potential for unpredictable events. Both forecasters correctly highlighted the recent Kremlin statements emphasizing 'adequate preparation' for a future summit as the primary evidence against a call occurring in the short resolution window. They also correctly identified the same countervailing factors that prevent the probability from being lower: the precedent of two recent calls, the lower logistical barrier of a call compared to a summit, the volatility of the geopolitical landscape (especially Ukraine), and Donald Trump's personalistic diplomatic style. I find their reasoning convincing as it independently validates my own analysis. No new evidence or novel lines of argument were presented that would cause me to substantially reconsider my position.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from the other forecasters, I am maintaining my forecast of 30%. The deliberation process has reinforced my confidence in my initial assessment, as we all independently identified the same key drivers and arrived at the same conclusion. The strongest evidence continues to be the official communications from the Kremlin, which consistently point toward a slower, more deliberate process focused on preparing for a future in-person summit, not an imminent phone call. This makes a call within the brief ~30 day window from May 12 to June 15 unlikely to be the base case. However, the probability remains a non-trivial 30% because this formal process can be easily short-circuited. An unexpected crisis in Ukraine or elsewhere could necessitate an urgent leader-level discussion, and the established precedent of two calls earlier in the year shows that the channel for such communication is open. Furthermore, Donald Trump's preference for direct, personal diplomacy could lead him to initiate a call to cut through bureaucratic preparation. The consensus among the forecasters strengthens my belief that 30% accurately balances the stated intentions of the Kremlin with the significant potential for unforeseen events and personality-driven actions to produce a 'Yes' outcome.",
