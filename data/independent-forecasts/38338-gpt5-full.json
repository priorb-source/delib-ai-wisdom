  "information": "In mid-May 2025, John Morgan stated he would observe the field of announced candidates before making a decision on running for governor. He also mentioned that if he were to run, his campaign would be brief, lasting approximately three months. Morgan has publicly considered running for governor in previous election cycles, including 2018 and 2022, but ultimately did not enter the races.\n\nProminent attorney John Morgan has announced plans to launch a new political party aimed at centrist voters, expressing dissatisfaction with the current two-party system. Multiple news outlets reported in February and May 2025 that Morgan has been working on this initiative for months, with lawyers preparing party-formation paperwork for what has been referred to as the 'Capitalist Party' or '#ForThePeople'.\n\nThe field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race has seen recent developments. On June 5, 2025, former Republican Congressman David Jolly announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination.

On the Republican side, Congressman Byron Donalds has launched his campaign, and Florida's First Lady, Casey DeSantis, is reportedly considering a run.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 25 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Morgan continues exploring a new centrist party and watching the 2026 field without making a formal candidacy announcement in June; he repeats his past pattern of flirting with runs but holding off.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Morgan seizes June media attention—possibly tied to a party launch or reaction to new entrants—and publicly declares he’s running for governor (as an independent, Democrat, or under his new party brand) before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: Only ~25 days remain. Announcements for a 2026 race this early are optional, and Morgan has said he’d prefer a brief, ~3‑month campaign, which argues for a later entry, not June 2025.\n- Track record/base rate: He publicly weighed runs in 2018 and 2022 but did not enter. This history leans toward non-announcement absent compelling triggers.\n- Current signals: Per Politico (mid‑May), he’s observing the field and contemplating a short campaign; he’s also been working on forming a centrist party (#ForThePeople/“Capitalist Party”). Party formation can proceed without an immediate candidacy announcement. On June 5, David Jolly entered the Democratic primary; Jason Pizzo plans an independent run; Byron Donalds is running on the GOP side; Casey DeSantis is considering. These developments don’t obviously force Morgan’s hand to announce within weeks.\n- Status quo weight: The world changes slowly; given his stated wait‑and‑see stance, the short runway he prefers, and his history of delaying and demurring, the default outcome by July 1 is No.\n- Why not higher: Limited time window; preference for a late, short campaign; past non‑entries; no strong public signals of an imminent announcement.\n- Why not lower: He did recently lay out a blueprint, has media momentum, and could pair a party launch with a candidacy announcement or respond to the evolving field in June—non‑zero chance.\n- Upward updates: Credible reports of a scheduled announcement event; Morgan publicly hinting at an imminent decision; formation of a candidate committee or major ad buy; party launch explicitly tied to his own candidacy; coordinated endorsements or donor meetings leaked.\n- Downward updates: Public statements pushing any decision to late 2025/2026; endorsing another candidate; reports that party formation will precede any decision by months; denial of near‑term intentions.",
