    "review": "All three forecasters agree on the central facts: the deadline is extremely close (less than three weeks), the primary window for NFL rule changes in March has passed, and instituting a ban now would be procedurally irregular and require a supermajority of owners. The main point of contention is the probability assigned to this irregular event occurring. Forecaster 3's analysis (5%) aligns closely with my own, emphasizing the immense institutional inertia and the unlikelihood of the league breaking precedent for what is ultimately a non-urgent, on-field strategic issue. I found Forecaster 2's analysis (15%) less convincing; while correctly identifying the issue's controversial nature, it seems to give too much weight to this controversy being able to overcome the significant procedural and timing hurdles that now exist. The time for that debate was in March, and it did not produce a ban.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am maintaining my initial assessment. The arguments presented have reinforced my view that the timeline is the single most important factor. With the deadline of June 1, 2025, less than three weeks away and the Annual League Meeting having concluded in March without a ban, the window for such a rule change is effectively closed. As Forecaster 3 rightly pointed out, while the 'Tush-Push' is a contentious play, it does not constitute an urgent crisis that would necessitate an emergency meeting and an unprecedented late-offseason rule change. The fact that the owners tabled the vote earlier in the year indicates a lack of the 24-vote consensus needed for a change. There is no new information to suggest that consensus has since been reached or that a special meeting is being planned. Therefore, the path of least resistance and greatest probability is for the status quo to hold until the issue is revisited in the next offseason cycle. My 5% forecast accounts for the small, non-zero chance of an unexpected catalyst forcing the league's hand, but recognizes the overwhelming institutional and procedural barriers to a 'Yes' resolution.",
