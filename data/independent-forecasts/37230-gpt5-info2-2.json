  "information": "In the week ending April 25, 2025, the S&P 500 index rose 4.6% to close at 5,525.21, its best weekly performance of the year to date. The Nasdaq Composite saw a 6.7% increase and the Dow Jones rose 2.5% during the same period. This rally was led by a recovery in large technology stocks. Despite the recent gains, market valuations are elevated, with the price-to-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 cited as being between 19 and 28, above historical averages. The VIX, a measure of market volatility, was recently observed at a high level of approximately 25.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month (until the market close on Fri, May 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Slightly more likely Yes — equities tend to drift upward month to month, so absent new shocks May would more often finish above April’s close.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A hotter-than-expected April CPI/PPI triggers a renewed rise in Treasury yields and a tech-led pullback; elevated VIX persists or spikes; late-May PCE runs hot; mega-cap guidance disappoints, leading to broad risk-off and a May 30 close below April 30.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Earnings/guidance from mega-caps stay solid, inflation data come in cooler or in-line, yields stabilize or fall, VIX fades, and breadth improves—allowing the S&P 500 to grind or push above the April 30 close by month-end.",
    "rationale": "Baseline/base-rate: Historically the S&P 500 finishes up in a given month roughly 60% of the time. That’s my starting point, reflecting that the world usually changes slowly and equity markets have a positive drift over monthly horizons.\n\nRecent context (assistant summary): The index rallied strongly into late April (week ending Apr 25 up ~4.6% to ~5,525), led by large-cap tech. Valuations are elevated (P/E cited in the high teens to upper 20s range) and the VIX is around 25, signaling above-average near-term volatility.\n\nImplications: \n- Pushes probability down from the base rate: Elevated valuations and a sharp late-month rebound raise the risk of giveback/mean reversion in May. A VIX near 25 implies wider tails and makes a downside month more plausible than in calmer regimes. Also, if April 30 closes strong, the bar for May to finish higher is a bit higher.\n- Pushes probability up from 50/50: Earnings momentum and still-resilient growth, plus the general monthly positive bias, support a modestly-better-than-even chance of a higher close by May 30. There is no May FOMC meeting, reducing policy-event risk, and a cooling inflation print could quickly buoy equities.\n\nNetting these, I weight the status quo/base-rate heavily and shade slightly downward for valuation/volatility and the risk of post-rally retracement. That yields a modest edge to Yes.\n\nWhy not higher: Elevated VIX, rich valuations, and the potential for a hot April CPI/PPI or weak guidance from mega-caps could flip the month negative. Seasonally, May is not especially strong.\n\nWhy not lower: Earnings have generally been supportive, the late-April rebound shows buyers are present, and monthly drift is historically positive; there’s no obvious imminent macro shock priced in.\n\nWhat would move me up: A softer April CPI mid-May, 10-year yields easing meaningfully (e.g., <4.3%), VIX trending back below ~18–19, broadening market breadth, and strong guidance from remaining large-cap reporters.\n\nWhat would move me down: An upside inflation surprise, 10-year yields pushing >4.7%, notable earnings/guidance disappointments (especially mega-caps), renewed geopolitical shocks, or credit spreads widening materially.\n\nNote: If April 30 sells off and sets a lower reference close, that mechanically raises the chance of a May-over-April gain; a late-April surge would do the opposite. I’ll update as that information arrives.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
