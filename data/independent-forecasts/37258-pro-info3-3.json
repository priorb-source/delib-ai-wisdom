  "information": "The Scottish Government has issued guidance advising against significant or high-profile government announcements between May 15 and June 5, 2025, due to a by-election campaign in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency. Separately, tens of thousands of Scottish council workers are being balloted on strike action, with the vote closing on June 12. Public opinion polls on independence are mixed; while one poll showed an 11-point lead for 'Yes,' other sources from late April 2025 indicate polling remains in the 45-55% range against independence, with one citing 54% opposition.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "59 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No referendum date is announced, as there is currently no agreed-upon legal framework or political consensus to hold one.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish government, facing inconsistent polling on independence, a pre-election quiet period until June 5, and potential widespread council strikes, decides that the political environment is not right for a referendum announcement. They focus on more immediate domestic issues and postpone any decision until after the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a surprise move intended to galvanize the independence movement and capitalize on a favorable poll, the First Minister of Scotland announces a date for a new independence referendum. This is done either just before the by-election quiet period in mid-May or immediately after it in early June, framed as fulfilling a democratic mandate regardless of the UK government's opposition.",
    "rationale": "The forecast for a 'No' outcome is very high due to several converging factors within a tight timeframe. The primary factor is the unfavorable political context for the Scottish Government. The window for an announcement is less than two months, and this is significantly constrained by a government-advised 'quiet period' for a by-election lasting from May 15 to June 5. This removes three crucial weeks. Furthermore, the threat of major industrial action by council workers, with a strike ballot closing June 12, creates a domestic backdrop where a major constitutional announcement could be perceived as a distraction or politically tone-deaf. The polling data on independence remains volatile; while one poll showed a significant 'Yes' lead, other recent data suggests opposition to independence remains ahead. Committing to a referendum without a clear, sustained majority in favor would be an immense political gamble for the governing SNP. The legal and constitutional barriers, with the UK Government staunchly opposed and the UK Supreme Court having previously ruled against a unilateral referendum, form a significant structural impediment. The status quo is strongly against an announcement.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because the question's criteria only require an announcement from a Scottish authority, irrespective of UK legality. A purely symbolic or political announcement remains a low-probability, high-impact option for the SNP to rally its base or provoke a constitutional debate. The probability is not higher because the confluence of short-term political hurdles (by-election, strikes) and the lack of a clear, sustained mandate in the polls makes such a move strategically unwise and highly unlikely before the July 1 deadline.\n\nI would raise my probability if several consecutive polls showed a strong, sustained lead for independence, or if the SNP leadership began to strongly signal an impending announcement. Conversely, I would lower it further if the council strikes become widespread and disruptive, or if the First Minister explicitly rules out an announcement in this timeframe.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Scottish Government has issued guidance advising against significant or high-profile government announcements between May 15 and June 5, 2025, due to a by-election campaign in the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse constituency.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
