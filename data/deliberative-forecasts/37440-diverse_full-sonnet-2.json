    "review": "The other forecasters provide valuable and well-reasoned analyses that largely converge with my own thinking. All three of us cluster tightly in the 15-18% range, which increases my confidence that this is the appropriate probability zone.\n\nForecaster 2 makes an important procedural distinction about the extended budget session versus a separate special session, emphasizing that the May 12 session is constitutionally mandated for budget purposes. Their point that calling a separate special session for a bill withdrawn just days earlier would be unusual is compelling. However, I note that Forecaster 3 identifies legitimate procedural pathways (Governor expanding the call, two-thirds vote to broaden agenda) that don't necessarily require a completely separate session.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis adds useful detail about alternative pathways I should weight more heavily: specifically, that narrower bills like HB 831 (requiring state IDs to indicate non-citizen status) would satisfy the resolution criteria and might face less resistance than the comprehensive CS/HB 1381. The explicit mention of litigation risk (NVRA preemption) as a factor for leadership caution is also valuable context.\n\nThe shared emphasis across all three analyses on the May 3 withdrawal as a strong negative signal reinforces my view that this is the most important recent development. The timing - just three days before my initial forecast - matters significantly. If leadership had the political will to pass this legislation before July 1, they would not have withdrawn it during the regular session when procedural pathways were most straightforward.\n\nThat said, all three of us recognize that the technical possibility remains: Republican supermajorities can overcome procedural hurdles if sufficiently motivated, and there are 56 days remaining.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, I find strong alignment in our reasoning but also some useful refinements to consider.\n\nThe core facts remain unchanged: CS/HB 1381 was withdrawn on May 3, the regular session concluded without passage, an extended budget session begins May 12, and Florida has unified Republican control with a supportive governor. The withdrawal three days ago is the strongest signal - it indicates that despite favorable political conditions, there wasn't sufficient consensus or urgency to advance this legislation through the most straightforward procedural pathway.\n\nForecaster 2's emphasis on the budget-focused nature of the extended session and the procedural difficulty of addressing non-budgetary policy is well-taken. However, Forecaster 3 correctly notes that with supermajorities, the Legislature technically has tools to expand the agenda if motivated. The question is whether that political will exists given the recent withdrawal.\n\nForecaster 3's point about narrower alternatives like HB 831 is important - the resolution criteria explicitly state that \"any subset of voters\" would count. This broadens the pathways to Yes beyond just the comprehensive CS/HB 1381. However, if narrower alternatives were viable, one might expect them to have advanced during the regular session.\n\nThe tight clustering of our forecasts (15-18%) suggests we've properly identified the key dynamics. The baseline is clearly No given the withdrawal and regular session conclusion. The non-zero probability reflects: (1) technical procedural pathways that exist with supermajorities, (2) strong political alignment on this issue, (3) national momentum, and (4) 56 days remaining. However, the recent withdrawal is a powerful signal against near-term action.\n\nI see no compelling reason to deviate significantly from my initial 18% forecast. The deliberation has reinforced rather than challenged my core reasoning.",
