    "review": "Both forecasters converge on the same core points I used: (1) the series is very stable and currently below $0.6300, (2) bananas are often priced as a loss leader, implying sticky retail pricing, and (3) the threshold is tight, so small month-to-month moves could flip the outcome. The most useful additional element was Forecaster 2’s explicit framing of typical month-to-month noise (~0.5–1.5 cents), which helps quantify how close we are to the line. Both also treat the reported 10% U.S. banana tariff as unconfirmed and therefore not base case. I agree; given the longstanding zero MFN duty on bananas and trade agreements with Latin American suppliers, a sudden broad 10% tariff would be highly newsworthy and seems unlikely absent corroboration. That makes me slightly more confident the upside risk was over-weighted in the RA. I also agree with their emphasis on the April print as the key near-term signal. Overall, their reasoning is consistent and nudges me a bit more bullish on “under.”",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Mar 2025 was $0.625; Jan was $0.621. With month-to-month moves often in the 0.5–1.5 cent range and bananas’ retail stickiness, a May outcome in the 0.627–0.629 area is a reasonable base case, which would resolve Yes. \n\nRisks: Dole’s commentary on higher fruit and shipping costs creates mild upward pressure, but improved volumes and grocer pricing strategies temper near-term pass-through. The RA’s claim of a new 10% U.S. banana tariff effective Apr 5, 2025 remains unverified and, given historical tariff structures, unlikely to be both real and immediately impactful in May. Other macro factors (e.g., U.S.–China developments) are largely irrelevant to banana supply chains.\n\nThreshold tightness: From $0.625 in March, only ~0.5 cents higher would hit $0.630. That’s within normal noise, so both sides remain plausible. However, absent a confirmed shock, the mean still looks slightly below the threshold.\n\nUpdate: In light of the other forecasters’ quantification of typical noise and shared skepticism about the tariff, I’m nudging my forecast a bit higher for “under,” pending the April print. I will adjust meaningfully after the April release: ≥$0.630 in April would push me toward a near coin-flip or lower for Yes; ≤$0.627 would increase confidence in Yes to mid-60s or higher.",
