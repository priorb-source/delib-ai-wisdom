    "review": "My initial forecast (75%) was primarily based on the strength of the status quo and Glastonbury's history of defending controversial acts. Forecaster 3 (68%) shared a similar view, weighting these factors heavily. However, Forecaster 2's analysis (40%) presented a compelling counterargument that I had underweighted: the specific nature of the police investigation. Forecaster 2 correctly distinguished this situation from general political controversy by highlighting the potential for criminal charges under UK law for supporting proscribed terrorist organizations (Hamas, Hezbollah). This introduces a unique legal, security, and licensing risk for the festival that is qualitatively different from past controversies. Their reasoning that pressure from police or security services behind the scenes could force a cancellation, even without public charges, is a crucial point I had not fully considered.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am updating my forecast. I find Forecaster 2's argument about the exceptional legal and security risks to be highly persuasive. My initial forecast over-indexed on Glastonbury's cultural ethos and underestimated the serious, non-public pressures the festival likely faces from its security and legal partners due to an ongoing police investigation into alleged support for proscribed groups. This is not simply a PR issue; it is a matter of potential criminal liability and public safety that could jeopardize the festival's license. While I still believe the status quo (the band remaining on the lineup) provides significant inertia towards a 'Yes' outcome, the risk of a forced cancellation is much higher than I first assessed. Therefore, I am lowering my probability significantly to reflect this heightened legal and operational risk. I am moving down from 75% to 60%, positioning me between my colleagues but acknowledging a much more uncertain environment than I initially perceived.",
