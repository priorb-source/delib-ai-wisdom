  "information": "As of mid-May 2025, flight tracking websites indicate that Saipan International Airport (SPN) has three to four non-stop flight destinations. These are Guam (GUM), served by United Airlines; Seoul-Incheon (ICN), served by Jeju Air, T’way Air, and Jin Air; Busan (PUS), served by Jeju Air; and an intermittently listed service to Tokyo-Narita (NRT), operated by United Airlines. A report by the Mastercard Economics Institute notes a general surge in travel within the Asia-Pacific region. Saipan's tourism appeal is supported by sightseeing opportunities related to its history, nature, and culture, including tours of WWII battlefields and natural sites like Managaha Island and The Grotto.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~6 weeks (about 42 days) until July 1, 2025; Metaculus may check any time on or after that date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the airport currently has 3–4 direct destinations listed; without additional routes being loaded into schedules by early July, the count will remain ≤4.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "United does not operate/list NRT for the summer and no Korean secondary/other routes are added, leaving only GUM, ICN, and PUS (or even with NRT, still just 4).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least five destinations appear on flightsfrom.com by early-to-mid July, e.g., GUM, ICN, PUS, NRT plus one added market such as Cheongju or Daegu (Korea), or a Japan/Taiwan city, via scheduled or subsidized seasonal services that are filed in GDS.",
    "rationale": "As of mid-May 2025, trackers show 3–4 non-stop destinations from Saipan: Guam (United), Seoul-Incheon (Jeju Air, T’way, Jin Air), Busan (Jeju Air), and an intermittently listed Tokyo-Narita (United). To resolve Yes (>4), Saipan needs at least five listed destinations when Metaculus checks on/after July 1. Given the short lead time, small market size, and airlines’ caution, adding enough new routes by early July is difficult. United’s NRT–SPN is uncertain for the summer (post-pandemic shift toward Haneda and tighter fleet), and additional Japan/Taiwan service appears unlikely without clear subsidy-backed announcements. Korean LCCs could add a secondary city (e.g., CJJ/TAE) as seasonal/charter service, but these must be filed as scheduled flights to appear on flightsfrom.com. The Asia-Pacific travel rebound helps, but Saipan’s recovery has lagged due to limited airlift and dependency on subsidies. Weighting the status quo heavily: - If NRT is not operating in July, getting from 3 to ≥5 requires two new destinations—unlikely in six weeks. - If NRT does operate, reaching 5 still requires one more new destination; plausible but not common without prior announcements. I would update higher on evidence that (1) United loads NRT–SPN for July, and/or (2) a Korean LCC (Jeju/T’way/Jin Air) loads a new city to Saipan for July, or (3) a Japan/Taiwan route is filed. I would lower if NRT disappears from summer schedules or if Korean capacity is trimmed. Overall, modest chance of last-minute, subsidy-backed seasonal routes nudges the probability above very low, but the base case remains ≤4.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 4 direct flight destinations from Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Northern Marianas struggles to revive tourism amid flight suspensions and travel restrictions: What you need to know?](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/northern-marianas-struggles-to-revive-tourism-amid-flight-suspensions-and-travel-restrictions-what-you-need-to-know/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
