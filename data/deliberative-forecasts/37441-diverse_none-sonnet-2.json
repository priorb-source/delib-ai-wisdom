    "review": "Both forecasters provide critical information that I failed to establish in my initial analysis. Most importantly, they anchor the forecast to concrete data: the current rate (USD ≈ 0.92 EUR, or EUR/USD ≈ 1.09) and the required magnitude of change (~13-15% appreciation in EUR/USD within 7 weeks). Forecaster 3's historical context is particularly valuable—EUR/USD rarely exceeding 1.25 since 2014 and last touching it briefly in early 2018 provides crucial base rate information I lacked. The statistical framing that this would require a multi-sigma move in a short timeframe is compelling. Both forecasters correctly note that such rapid moves in major currency pairs typically require severe systemic shocks, not just policy uncertainty. The translation to EUR/USD > 1.25 also makes the threshold clearer for analysis. I underweighted historical base rates and overweighted tail risk scenarios in my initial 18% forecast. However, I do think there's merit to slightly weighting the 'any point' criterion and intraday spike possibility higher than both forecasters did, given the existing tariff turmoil context and dollar weakness mentioned in the background.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I am convinced my initial 18% was too high and insufficiently anchored to empirical data. The key factors that should lower my forecast are: (1) The concrete magnitude—13-15% currency appreciation in 7 weeks is historically rare for EUR/USD; (2) Base rates—EUR/USD has rarely exceeded 1.25 since 2014, with only brief touches around 2018; (3) Statistical improbability—this would be a multi-sigma event given typical volatility; (4) No clear imminent catalyst despite the tariff turmoil. However, I remain slightly less confident than the 5% consensus because: (1) The 'any point' resolution criterion means even a brief intraday spike counts, which the question structure favors; (2) The Morningstar article suggests ongoing dollar weakness and volatility; (3) Currency markets can overshoot during crises; (4) A 7-week window, while short, does allow for one or two major events that could spike the rate. The rigorous anchoring to current rates and historical precedent provided by the other forecasters is persuasive, but I assign marginally higher probability to tail scenarios producing a brief breach above 1.25.",
