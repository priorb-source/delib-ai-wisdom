    "review": "Both forecasters correctly emphasize the strong structural incentives against crossing the Rubicon (EU/US consequences, Serbia’s likely restraining influence, and Dodik’s track record of brinkmanship without fully committing). I agree the short runway to July 1 marginally lowers odds, but I don’t find “logistics” persuasive as a binding constraint: scheduling a referendum (even for a later date) is administratively simple once the political decision is made, so the time factor chiefly matters via political sequencing, not operational capacity. I also share the view that Crimea is a poor comparator absent decisive external force. What I’d add is that “officially scheduled” can occur via a single RSNA decision or presidential promulgation, which preserves speed if a trigger appears (e.g., a state-property enforcement clash, a court verdict against Dodik, or an OHR move). Where I differ slightly is weighting the possibility of a face-saving escalation: if Dodik feels cornered, announcing a date (even months out) is a relatively low-effort, high-signal step. That keeps my estimate a bit higher than 15–20%, though I agree the modal outcome is No.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining: ~60 days. Status quo favors No. Key deterrents: immediate Western/EU penalties, loss of leverage from ambiguity, and likely Serbian pressure to avoid a crisis. Key enablers: RS has legal/political groundwork, centralized decision-making can move fast, and a discrete trigger could prompt an announcement that schedules a vote later in 2025. I discount “logistical difficulty” and focus on political calculus and triggers. Since I see no concrete, imminent trigger on the calendar (e.g., a publicly scheduled enforcement action, OHR intervention, or verdict date) and no sign of weakening Western resolve, I trim my prior slightly. Upside risks remain material: a sudden confrontation over state property, a Dodik court setback, or a perceived affront by the OHR could rapidly produce an RSNA session to set a date. Downside movers would be visible de-escalation, inducements from EU/US/Serbia, or channeling energy into a constitutional referendum that avoids explicit independence wording before July 1. Net: modest downward adjustment, keeping a meaningful tail for a trigger-driven announcement.",
