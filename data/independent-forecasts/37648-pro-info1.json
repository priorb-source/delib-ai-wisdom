  "information": "Ali Shamkhani, an advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader, has stated that Iran is ready to accept a new nuclear agreement with the United States in exchange for the immediate lifting of all economic sanctions. According to Shamkhani, Iran would commit to never producing nuclear weapons, eliminate its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and limit uranium enrichment to civilian levels under international oversight. Iran is currently enriching uranium to 60%. In a separate proposal presented during talks in Oman, Iran suggested the creation of a permanent joint nuclear enrichment company with regional Arab countries and American investors. Under this plan, Iran would continue to enrich uranium to a low level for civilian use and export it to other Arab nations, subject to increased international monitoring. Iranian officials have stated that the complete dismantlement of its nuclear program is a 'red line' but they are willing to cooperate to maintain their right to develop a peaceful civilian program.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (until July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new nuclear deal is announced. The United States maintains its sanctions regime, and Iran continues its nuclear program, including enrichment at high levels, without the constraints of a formal agreement.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing talks and positive signals, negotiators fail to resolve complex technical details regarding verification, monitoring, and the precise sequencing of sanctions relief versus nuclear concessions before the deadline. Domestic political opposition in Washington or Tehran hardens, causing one or both sides to balk at the final terms, and the July 1, 2025 date passes without an announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Intense back-channel negotiations, primarily through intermediaries like Oman, lead to a breakthrough. Facing severe economic pressure, Iran's leadership formally approves a deal based on the terms outlined by Ali Shamkhani. The US administration, eager to de-escalate regional tensions and score a diplomatic win, agrees to the terms and uses executive authority to formalize the agreement, leading to a joint announcement before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily shaped by the tension between strong positive signals for a deal and an exceptionally tight deadline. The status quo, which heavily favors a 'No' outcome, is that these negotiations are complex, fraught with decades of mistrust, and typically take many months, if not years, to conclude. However, the evidence presented suggests a significant departure from this baseline. The statements from Ali Shamkhani, an advisor to the Supreme Leader, are unusually specific, offering a clear framework: full sanctions relief for a verifiable halt to weaponization-potential activities, including the elimination of the highly enriched uranium stockpile. This indicates that Iran's leadership may have a prepared, actionable proposal. Furthermore, the Israeli intelligence assessment that a deal has a 'high chance' is a significant piece of evidence, as Israel is a key, well-informed, and often skeptical stakeholder. These factors strongly suggest that negotiations are at an advanced stage. The primary countervailing factor, and the reason my forecast is not higher, is the extremely short timeframe of just over six weeks. Finalizing the intricate legal and technical language of such a deal, securing consensus among all government branches in both countries, and arranging a formal announcement is a monumental task to complete in this period. My probability of 40% reflects a significant update from a low baseline, driven by the specific evidence of progress, but it is tempered by the powerful practical constraint of the calendar. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see evidence of direct, high-level talks or a leaked draft text. Conversely, a public statement from a key official in either country rejecting the reported terms would cause me to lower my forecast significantly.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
