    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 32 days remain until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No arrest occurs. The status quo is that James Comey, a former FBI director, is not arrested.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service investigation into the seashells photo concludes that it constitutes protected political speech or artistic expression. No probable cause for arrest is established. The matter is closed or resolved through means other than arrest. Comey remains free without charges being filed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service investigation escalates rapidly, determining that the '86 47' seashells photo constitutes a credible threat against a sitting or former president. Prosecutors find sufficient cause to pursue charges, an arrest warrant is issued, and Comey is taken into custody before July 1, 2025. Alternatively, unrelated charges emerge that lead to his arrest.",
    "rationale": "Base rate analysis strongly favors no arrest. Arrests of former FBI directors are extraordinarily rare events in U.S. history. Even with the ongoing Secret Service inquiry into the seashells photo, several high barriers exist: (1) The 32-day timeline is extremely compressed for moving from investigation to arrest in such a high-profile, politically sensitive case. (2) First Amendment protections for speech, even controversial political expression, are substantial. Courts would likely scrutinize any charges heavily. (3) The news indicates the Secret Service is in the 'asking' phase, suggesting early investigation rather than imminent action. (4) Establishing probable cause sufficient to arrest a former FBI director would require clear evidence of criminal intent, not merely provocative imagery. (5) The political sensitivity of arresting someone involved in controversial Trump-era investigations would necessitate overwhelming evidence and careful prosecutorial review. However, the probability is not near-zero because: (1) An active federal investigation exists. (2) The '86 47' reference could plausibly be interpreted as threatening language ('86' as slang for elimination, '47' referencing Trump). (3) The question allows arrest for ANY reason, not just this specific incident. (4) Politically charged environments have led to unexpected legal actions. I would revise upward if reports emerged of imminent charges, arrest warrants, or prosecutorial intent. I would revise downward if the investigation closed or was characterized as routine without merit for charges.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
