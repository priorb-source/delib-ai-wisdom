  "information": "In May 2025, the US Department of State imposed visa restrictions on Indian travel agency executives and staff who were found to have knowingly enabled unlawful entry into the US. In a separate action, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghanistan, scheduled to take effect on July 14, 2025. Concurrently, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction that blocked a DHS attempt to terminate TPS for Venezuelan nationals.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks (42 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the page remains online at the specified URL",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration takes executive action to suspend or terminate the Diversity Visa program and removes the webpage as part of this action. Alternatively, the State Department restructures its website and moves or removes this specific page from the current URL, or experiences technical issues that result in the page being unavailable.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The page simply continues to exist at its current location with no changes. The DV program continues operating normally, and the State Department maintains the standard informational webpage for program entry instructions. This is the default continuation of the current state.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. The DV program entry page has been maintained at this location for years as part of an immigration program established by the Immigration Act of 1990. While Trump has historically opposed the DV program (as referenced in the 2017 tweet), and the current administration has shown willingness to make immigration policy changes (the research assistant notes visa restrictions and TPS terminations in May 2025), no specific action regarding the DV program has been reported. The critical factor is the short timeframe - only 6 weeks until resolution. Even if the administration wanted to eliminate or suspend the DV program, such changes typically require significant time for implementation. Legislative elimination would need Congressional action, which is highly unlikely in 6 weeks. Executive suspension might be possible but would typically involve policy announcements before webpage removal. Website restructuring is theoretically possible but would be unusual to target this specific page without broader changes. The research assistant's report mentions various immigration actions but nothing about the DV program website specifically, suggesting no imminent changes. Government bureaucracy and website management typically move slowly. My forecast is not higher (95%+) because there is some risk of sudden executive action given the administration's immigration focus, and website issues or restructuring remain possible. It's not lower (below 85%) because the very short timeframe, lack of any evidence of imminent DV program changes, and strong status quo bias make it highly likely the page remains accessible at the specified URL.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US State Department's Diversity Visa page still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | [Donald Trump's 2017 tweet discussing the DV program](https://x.com/realDonaldTrump/status/925684982307348480)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Step 1 Submit an Entry page with instructions for registering for the Diversity Immigrant Visa (DV) Program is at [this location](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/diversity-visa-program-entry/diversity-visa-submit-entry1.html) when attempted to be accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn May 2025, the US Department of State imposed visa restrictions on Indian travel agency executives and staff who were found to have knowingly enabled unlawful entry into the US.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
