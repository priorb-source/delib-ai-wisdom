    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No: South Sudan has not yet ratified AfCFTA and, absent new concrete legislative or executive action, it will not complete ratification and deposit in time.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No ratification bill is tabled or passed by the National Legislative Assembly in May/June; or it passes but the instrument of ratification is not prepared and deposited with the AU Commission before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The cabinet approves the AfCFTA ratification, the National Legislative Assembly fast-tracks and passes it, the President assents, and the instrument of ratification is deposited with the AU Commission before July 1—possibly timed to an AU/AfCFTA event or as part of an economic reform push.",
    "rationale": "Time is short (~2 months). Late-stage AfCFTA ratifiers have generally moved slowly, and South Sudan’s legislative and administrative processes are often protracted due to capacity constraints, competing priorities (security, humanitarian needs, election preparations), and frequent delays. As of my latest reliable knowledge (through 2024), South Sudan had not ratified; the assistant provided no new indication of a bill being tabled, scheduled, or an imminent deposit. Historically, the tail-end non-ratifiers tend to have lower near-term hazard rates of ratification; completing the full chain (cabinet approval → parliamentary ratification → presidential assent → deposit with AU) within weeks is possible but uncommon without clear political prioritization. Why not higher: no public evidence here of a live ratification bill or a stated government deadline, and deposits to the AU must occur before July 1 to count. Why not lower: South Sudan’s executive can sometimes push priority measures quickly; an external nudge (e.g., AU/AfCFTA Secretariat engagement, donor-linked reforms, or a domestic economic narrative) could compress timelines. What would move me up: credible reports that (1) the cabinet has approved the ratification memo, (2) the National Legislative Assembly has scheduled or completed readings/committee review, or (3) the Ministry of Foreign Affairs/Justice is preparing or has prepared the instrument for deposit, or confirmation from the AU/AfCFTA Secretariat. What would move me down: indications of parliamentary recess, new political disruptions, or authoritative AU lists showing no movement by mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill South Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Star Worldwide via MSN: [World Chambers Africa Summit maps economic path for South Sudan](https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/other/world-chambers-africa-summit-maps-economic-path-for-south-sudan/ar-AA1CTigs?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if South Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
