  "information": "Saipan has become a popular destination for Korean tourists, who constituted 70% of the island's visitors in 2024. The Governor of Saipan, Arnold Palacios, has identified the Korean tourist market as a primary focus for growth and sustainability. In line with this, the Mariana Visitors Authority launched a marketing campaign titled 'This is the Marianas' for the Korean market. The 2025 Saipan Marathon attracted over 200 Korean participants out of 612 runners from 19 countries. Additionally, KB Kookmin Card initiated a promotional event for its Visa cardholders traveling to destinations including Saipan, offering discounts on flights, hotels, dining, and shopping starting from July 18.\n\nThe weakness of the Japanese yen poses a challenge to tourism in the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI), as Japanese travelers tend to prefer non-U.S. dollar destinations. Japanese visitor numbers to the CNMI were 7,762 in 2023 and 13,779 in 2024, with the increase largely due to cruise ship arrivals. In response, United Airlines has launched a digital advertising campaign for its Narita-Saipan route, and the Marianas Visitors Authority has partnered with Japanese travel agencies. The islands also received diving awards at the 'Marine Diving Fair 2025' in Tokyo, highlighting their appeal. Separately, Hong Kong Airlines lists Saipan as one of its destinations, and travel platform Expedia noted a significant increase in search volume for Saipan from Hong Kong travelers.\n\nAs of mid-May 2025, flight tracking websites indicate that Saipan International Airport (SPN) has three to four non-stop flight destinations. These are Guam (GUM), served by United Airlines; Seoul-Incheon (ICN), served by Jeju Air, T’way Air, and Jin Air; Busan (PUS), served by Jeju Air; and an intermittently listed service to Tokyo-Narita (NRT), operated by United Airlines. A report by the Mastercard Economics Institute notes a general surge in travel within the Asia-Pacific region. Saipan's tourism appeal is supported by sightseeing opportunities related to its history, nature, and culture, including tours of WWII battlefields and natural sites like Managaha Island and The Grotto.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 42 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FlightsFrom lists only Guam (GUM), Seoul-Incheon (ICN), Busan (PUS), and possibly Tokyo-Narita (NRT) on/around July 1, totaling 3–4 destinations, i.e., not greater than 4.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In addition to GUM, ICN, and PUS, United’s NRT service is loaded and visible for early July and at least one more route is scheduled (e.g., a Korean secondary city such as Daegu/CJJ/Muan or Hong Kong), bringing the total to 5+ destinations on FlightsFrom.",
    "rationale": "Baseline as of mid-May 2025 is 3–4 destinations (GUM, ICN, PUS, and intermittent NRT). To clear the threshold (>4), Saipan needs at least two more visible destinations if NRT drops out, or at least one more if NRT is present. The research assistant notes: strong Korean demand and focused marketing; weak Japanese yen suppressing Japan outbound; United marketing NRT, but NRT listing is intermittent; Hong Kong Airlines lists Saipan as a destination and HK interest is rising, but no confirmed scheduled resumption is cited. Structural headwinds include aircraft/crew constraints among LCCs, currency pressure on Japan demand, and lingering uncertainty on broader North Asia capacity. With only ~6 weeks to July 1, launching and loading entirely new routes into schedules is possible but not likely without prior announcements. Seasonal Korean LCC additions could occur, but we lack concrete signals. FlightsFrom counts only scheduled non-stops, not ad hoc charters. Therefore, the status quo (3–4) is the anchor, and world changes slowly: most likely outcome is No. Why not higher: achieving 5+ requires NRT plus at least one additional city becoming visible on FlightsFrom within weeks, absent strong evidence. Why not lower: there are plausible pathways—United’s NRT could be active in early July, and a Korean LCC could add a seasonal secondary city, or HKG could (re)start, especially for summer peak. What would move me up: confirmed schedule filings or airline press releases for any additional SPN routes (e.g., HKG-SPN loaded by Hong Kong Airlines; new Korean secondary city service; sustained NRT schedule around July 1; any Japan second city like KIX/NGO). What would move me down: confirmation that NRT is not operating in early July; removal of any currently listed destination on FlightsFrom; negative airline capacity guidance or policy restrictions affecting CNMI.",
