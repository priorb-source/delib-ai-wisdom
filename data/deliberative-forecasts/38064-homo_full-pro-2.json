    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis was very similar to my own initial forecast, weighing the historical pattern and aggregator data heavily while noting the missing SEC filing as a point of concern. However, Forecaster 3 introduced a critical piece of evidence that I had significantly undervalued: the SEC's regulatory requirements for proxy statement filings. Specifically, Forecaster 3 highlights the '40-day notice and access' rule, which requires proxy materials to be sent to shareholders at least 40 calendar days before the meeting. This argument is exceptionally convincing because it presents a hard, verifiable constraint that overrides the softer, speculative evidence like historical patterns or conflicting aggregator data.",
    "rationale": "Upon reviewing the other forecasts, I am making a significant update. My initial analysis was flawed because I treated the missing Definitive Proxy Statement (DEF 14A) as a point of moderate uncertainty, when it is, in fact, a near-disqualifying factor. Forecaster 3's citation of the SEC's 40-day rule is the decisive argument. As of May 27, 2025, we are only 16 days away from the proposed meeting date of June 12. GameStop has clearly missed the 40-day deadline to notify shareholders. This regulatory procedural failure makes it almost impossible for the meeting to be legally held on June 12, 2025.\n\nThis new understanding invalidates the evidence I previously leaned on. The data from Bloomberg and Business Insider, as well as the historical meeting cadence, are rendered irrelevant in the face of this hard regulatory constraint. It is far more likely that the aggregator data is outdated or speculative, a conclusion supported by the conflicting dates and errors noted in the initial research report. The risk of technical failure, which I considered, is now a secondary concern, as the meeting is unlikely to even be scheduled for that day in the first place.\n\nTherefore, I am drastically lowering my forecast. The probability now reflects the near-impossibility of the company proceeding with the meeting on this date without having met federal securities regulations. I am not setting the probability at 0% to account for the very small chance of an error in our information regarding the filing status or the existence of a rare, unknown regulatory exemption. My forecast is now aligned with Forecaster 3.",
