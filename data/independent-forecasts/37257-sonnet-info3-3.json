  "information": "Historical and legal precedents provide context for a potential referendum. Bosnia's Constitutional Court has ruled on multiple occasions that celebrating Republika Srpska Day on January 9 is unconstitutional. Despite this, RS held a parade for the banned holiday in January 2025. Analysis of other independence movements shows varying timelines: the process for Catalonia's 2017 referendum took approximately 7-8 months from legislative groundwork to the announcement, while Scotland's 2014 referendum process took about 2 years. In contrast, Crimea's 2014 referendum, under Russian influence, was organized in about two weeks. The political structure of Bosnia and Herzegovina is based on the 1995 Dayton Agreement, which divided the country into two entities: the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No referendum announcement is made. Republika Srpska continues current political tensions and provocative actions but stops short of officially scheduling an independence referendum.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing tensions and nationalist rhetoric, RS leadership faces sufficient international pressure and internal constraints that prevent them from announcing a referendum date before July 1. The provocative actions like the January 2025 banned parade remain symbolic gestures rather than precursors to actual referendum planning.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following a rapid escalation pattern similar to Crimea's 2014 referendum (organized in about 2 weeks), RS leadership, potentially emboldened by Russian support and recent defiance of constitutional rulings, announces a referendum date in late May or June 2025. The announcement meets the technical criteria regardless of its legality within Bosnia and Herzegovina.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. While RS demonstrated willingness to defy constitutional authority with the January 2025 parade for the banned holiday, there's a significant difference between symbolic provocations and announcing an independence referendum. The research assistant notes that referendum timelines vary widely - from Crimea's 2 weeks to Scotland's 2 years - but crucially, there are no current reports of concrete referendum preparation in RS. With only 2 months remaining, the window is narrow. The question's low bar (only requiring an announcement from RS authorities, not broader legality) does increase the possibility slightly. However, even provocative actors typically face domestic and international constraints that prevent the most extreme actions. The recent parade suggests heightened tensions but doesn't necessarily indicate imminent referendum planning. My forecast isn't higher because there are no concrete signals of referendum preparation, and international pressure would be substantial. It isn't lower because RS has shown recent defiance, the Crimea precedent shows rapid organization is possible, and only an announcement (not the actual referendum) is required by July 1. I would revise upward if RS begins legislative preparations or leadership makes specific referendum timing statements. I would revise downward as time passes without such developments or if mediation efforts appear successful.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical and legal precedents provide context for a potential referendum.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
