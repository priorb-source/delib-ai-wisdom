    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 33 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (as of Apr 30, 2025 the 250th was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 250th slot on July 1 is occupied by Devasini or another non-U.S. billionaire from the cluster around ranks ~240–260 (e.g., Europe/India/China). Modest market/currency moves keep a non-U.S. name at the median on that day.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "U.S. equities continue to outperform into late June, lifting mid-tier U.S. fortunes such that a U.S. billionaire lands at rank 250 on July 1. Alternatively, churn around the cutoff puts a U.S. name at 250 on that specific day, or Bloomberg’s classification lists the 250th person’s country as United States due to an update.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: Around the middle of the Bloomberg 500, the U.S. typically comprises a large but sub-majority share (roughly mid-30s percent). If we viewed July 1 as a random draw from the pool near ranks 240–260, a naive base rate would be in that range for the 250th being American.\n- Status quo: On Apr 30, rank 250 was Italian (Giancarlo Devasini), so the most recent known snapshot favors a No. While the index updates daily and the specific person at 250 can change often, good forecasting practice gives some extra weight to the latest observed state, as change is usually incremental.\n- Market context: 2025 has generally seen strong U.S. equity performance, which modestly raises the chance that a U.S. billionaire occupies the median rank by July 1. Countervailing forces include strong representation from Europe and Asia around the mid-ranks and idiosyncratic wealth moves (e.g., crypto-linked wealth, private valuations). USD strength would also marginally favor U.S. fortunes when measured in USD.\n- Net effect: Combine (1) a base U.S. share around the mid-ranks in the mid-30s percent, (2) a small downward adjustment for the recent non-U.S. status quo at rank 250, and (3) a small upward nudge for U.S. market strength. These roughly offset, leaving a probability close to the mid-to-high 30s.\n- Why not higher: The U.S. does not constitute a majority at this rank; the most recent known occupant is non-U.S.; and the exact identity at 250 is noisy day-to-day.\n- Why not lower: The U.S. remains the single largest national cohort; U.S. market momentum into quarter-end could nudge a U.S. name into the 250th slot; daily churn gives multiple chances for a U.S. person to land precisely at 250 on July 1.\n- Updates that would move me: (Up) If late-June daily snapshots show multiple U.S. names clustering around 245–255, or if U.S. markets/currency materially strengthen relative to others. (Down) If non-U.S. names dominate 245–255, if there’s a U.S. market pullback or USD weakness, or if Devasini (or another non-U.S. billionaire) appears stably anchored near 250.\n- Research assistant inputs: None beyond the April 30 reference; no additional data to refine country composition around the cutoff.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked name on the list was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025. It resolves as **No** if the 250th-ranked person is from any other country.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the \"median\" from the question's title is defined as the 250th ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, no matter how many are on the list.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
