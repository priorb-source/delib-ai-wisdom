  "information": "As of early June 2025, Sudan has not ratified the AfCFTA agreement nor submitted its Provisional Schedule of Tariff Concessions. The country is in an ongoing civil war, resulting in fragmented government, the absence of a functioning legislature, and suspension from the African Union (AU). Despite the conflict, a draft national AfCFTA implementation strategy for Sudan was previously reviewed and validated by stakeholders in a process supported by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD).\n\nAcross Africa, 47 of the 54 signatory nations had ratified the AfCFTA agreement as of July 2024. However, overall implementation of the trade area since its 2021 launch has been described as sluggish. According to trade policy analysts, key impediments include production-related challenges like low industrial output, poor infrastructure, and non-tariff barriers. The original goal of removing tariffs on 90% of goods has been pushed back to 2034.\n\nA recent UN Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) report highlighted the AfCFTA's potential to boost trade-led growth and increase Africa's GDP by 1.2% by 2045 with full implementation. Other regional developments include a forum in Zambia focused on digital trade integration, an emphasis on arbitration for resolving trade disputes, and the promotion of the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) to facilitate transactions in local currencies. Meanwhile, Nigeria has ratified the agreement, and South Africa and Lesotho are strengthening bilateral trade ties to advance AfCFTA goals.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "25 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing civil war continues, and Sudan's government remains fragmented and lacks a functioning legislature. Without the necessary state institutions and with the country's leadership focused on the conflict, no formal process to ratify the AfCFTA agreement is undertaken before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A comprehensive and immediate peace agreement is signed between the warring factions in early June 2025. A unified transitional government is rapidly formed and internationally recognized. This new government makes ratification of AfCFTA a top symbolic priority and fast-tracks the legal and parliamentary procedures, depositing the instrument of ratification with the African Union Commission just before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly confident that Sudan will not ratify the AfCFTA before the July 1, 2025 deadline. The primary and decisive factor is the ongoing civil war, which has led to the collapse of unified state institutions. Treaty ratification is a formal legal process requiring a stable, legitimate government and a functioning legislature to debate and approve the agreement. As the research indicates, Sudan currently has a fragmented government and no functioning legislature. Furthermore, its suspension from the African Union complicates its ability to participate in and formalize such continental agreements.\n\nThe timeline is another critical factor. With less than a month until the deadline, the series of events required for a 'Yes' outcome—a complete cessation of hostilities, the formation of a new unified government, and the execution of all bureaucratic ratification procedures—is virtually impossible to achieve. While there was prior work on a national implementation strategy, this reflects a pre-conflict ambition and has no bearing on the current reality of a state unable to perform basic functions, let alone engage in complex international trade legislation.\n\nMy probability is not lower, at absolute zero, only to account for a minuscule, 'black swan' possibility of an unforeseen and miraculous political resolution. It is not any higher because the fundamental prerequisites for ratification are entirely absent, and there is no credible pathway for them to materialize within the given timeframe.\n\nI would only increase my forecast upon seeing evidence of an immediate, all-encompassing peace deal being signed and a unified government being seated within the next few days. Conversely, continued reports of conflict would simply reinforce this existing high-confidence forecast.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
