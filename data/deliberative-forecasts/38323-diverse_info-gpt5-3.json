    "review": "Forecaster 2 introduces a key claim I hadn’t factored in: that May 2025’s final Michigan sentiment was 52.2 with the Expectations subindex at 47.3. If true, that materially lowers the base level and makes a >60 June outcome require a very large monthly rebound, which is historically uncommon. However, parts of their write-up are internally inconsistent (they also say April–May stabilized), and the 52.2 headline value conflicts with my prior understanding and with Forecaster 3’s framing. Forecaster 3’s argument—that sub-60 readings are historically uncommon outside severe downturns and that the 60 threshold is low—is broadly true over long history, but 2022 showed that sub-60 can persist without a formal recession, and they don’t anchor to recent actual levels. I find F2’s argument consequential if the specific numbers are correct, but I’m not fully convinced those numbers are accurate. The divergence between Michigan (downbeat) and the Conference Board (improving) that the RA notes is a relevant counterpoint supporting some rebound potential.",
    "rationale": "My prior forecast (82% Yes) assumed May levels were safely above 60 and that June’s final would likely remain above that threshold. Given Forecaster 2’s claim (May final ~52) could be right, I need to incorporate the nontrivial chance that the starting point is well below 60, which would require an unusually large one-month gain for a Yes resolution. At the same time, the macro backdrop is mixed rather than crisis-like: Conference Board confidence rose sharply in May, equities are generally resilient, and there’s a plausible path to stabilization if the June prelim (mid-month) reflects calmer inflation expectations and decent labor data. Weighing these, I lower my probability but keep it above 50% because (a) the 60 bar is historically low, (b) the CB–Michigan divergence sometimes precedes Michigan mean reversion, and (c) there’s meaningful uncertainty around the exact May Michigan level cited by F2. Key updates that would push me higher: benign CPI and a decent payrolls/unemployment print; push me lower: hot CPI, weak payrolls/rising jobless rate, or June prelim at/below ~58. Net: I update down materially from 82% to reflect downside risk and possible low base, but not all the way to F2’s 10% given doubts about their figures and the mixed data picture.",
