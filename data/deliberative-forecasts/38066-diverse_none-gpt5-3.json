    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize two key negatives I already weighed: (1) default conference practice is separate headliner slots, and (2) the Altman–Musk feud (including litigation/competition) makes a joint stage appearance unlikely. They also stress the lack of pre-event marketing for a joint session as strong contrary evidence, which I agree is a meaningful negative signal this close to the event. Their upside case rests on YC’s incentive for spectacle and Musk’s unpredictability—factors I had considered. New or different: Forecaster 3 asserts a general precedent of these figures avoiding shared platforms; I’m not fully convinced without specific examples, especially since they did share a YC stage in 2016 (though the relationship has deteriorated since). Neither weighs the attendance/no‑show/virtual risk as explicitly as I did, which I think is material and pushes the probability down. Overall, their reasoning largely aligns with mine, and I don’t see compelling new evidence to move my estimate materially.",
    "rationale": "Baseline favors No: headliners are typically scheduled separately, and if a joint session were planned, YC would likely promote it to maximize buzz. The adversarial context (OpenAI vs. xAI, past litigation and public criticism) adds PR/security risk and gives both parties reasons to avoid sharing a stage unless it’s a clearly framed debate—again something that would usually be advertised. Attendance risk matters: Altman’s in-person attendance seems highly likely; Musk’s is less certain given his history of schedule volatility. Even if both attend in person, organizers can easily avoid overlap. Countervailing factors: YC’s appetite for marquee moments, prior Altman–Musk appearance (2016), and the low bar for “sharing a stage” (even a brief handoff or joint Q&A would count). Decomposition: P(Altman attends in person) ~0.9; P(Musk attends in person) ~0.7 ⇒ P(both) ~0.63. Conditional on both, chance of any same-stage overlap remains modest (~0.18) given tensions and event norms. Combined ≈ 0.63 × 0.18 ≈ 11–12%. Signals that would raise: official schedule or credible hints of a joint session/debate or a closing panel involving both. Signals that would lower: schedule showing strictly separate slots/days, reports of a virtual appearance or cancellation by either, or explicit guidance that speakers won’t overlap. With ~3 weeks left and no promotional cues of a joint segment, I’m holding close to prior.",
