    "review": "The other forecasters make several compelling arguments I should weigh more heavily. Forecaster 3's point about the research assistant finding 'no additional information' being significant is particularly strong - if an announcement were planned, we would typically see campaign staff movements, fundraising activity, or media reports about preparation. Forecaster 3 also correctly emphasizes that modern political campaigns rarely announce spontaneously; they require weeks of visible preparation. All forecasters appropriately highlight that with only 26 days remaining and zero signals of an imminent announcement, the status quo bias should be very strong. Additionally, both forecasters note that the negative political environment (Trump backing Donalds, unfavorable polling) may have already led her to decide against running or at least to delay beyond July 1. I was perhaps too generous in my initial 20% forecast.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should update my forecast downward. The complete absence of any announcement signals, campaign infrastructure building, or media reporting about imminent candidacy this close to the July 1 deadline is more significant than I initially weighted. Political campaigns of this magnitude almost invariably involve visible preparation - staff hiring, fundraising setup, venue booking for announcement events, coordination with local party officials - and we see none of that. The other forecasters correctly emphasize that 26 days is approaching the bare minimum for even a rushed announcement, and most candidates would have telegraphed their intentions by now. The unfavorable political dynamics (Trump's endorsement of Donalds, trailing in polls) likely mean she has already decided not to run or to wait until after July 1. However, I maintain some probability above the lowest forecast because political surprises do occur, and we lack explicit confirmation she has ruled out running. I'm updating to 14%, which better reflects the weight of evidence while acknowledging residual uncertainty.",
