    "review": "The other forecasters presented compelling arguments that I had previously under-weighted. Their structured decomposition of the problem into two distinct probabilities—P(meeting is scheduled for June 12) and P(meeting completes | scheduled for June 12)—was particularly insightful. I found their emphasis on the significance of the missing DEF 14A filing to be the most convincing point. They correctly framed its absence not merely as a lack of information, but as strong evidence against the June 12 date being accurate, given the proximity of the date and standard corporate notification timelines. Forecaster 3's point regarding the typical 20-day notice versus the 10-day legal minimum provided useful context that reinforces the abnormality of the situation. This has directly caused me to reassess the likelihood of the meeting even being scheduled for the target date.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward from 65% to 43%. My initial analysis over-weighted the historical pattern of GameStop holding its annual meeting on a Thursday in mid-June and did not sufficiently penalize the forecast for the lack of a definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A) from the SEC. The other forecasters correctly highlighted that the absence of this key document this close to the proposed date is a strong negative signal.\n\nAdopting their more rigorous, decomposed approach, I now assess the probability in two parts:\n1. Probability the meeting is actually scheduled for June 12: I now believe this is close to a coin flip. The positive signals (historical pattern, some data aggregators) are balanced by strong negative signals (no official SEC filing, conflicting information from the company's transfer agent). I estimate this probability at 50%.\n2. Probability the meeting completes successfully on that day, given it was scheduled: The 2024 server crash sets a precedent for failure. However, it's reasonable to assume GameStop has invested in more robust infrastructure to avoid a repeat of that public failure. The risk is non-zero but not enormous. I estimate the chance of successful completion at 85%.\n\nMultiplying these probabilities (0.50 * 0.85) results in a combined probability of 42.5%. This significant downward revision reflects the compelling arguments that the uncertainty from the missing SEC filing is a more decisive factor than I had originally appreciated.",
