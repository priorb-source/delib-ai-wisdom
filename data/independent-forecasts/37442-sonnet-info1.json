  "information": "In late 2024 and early 2025, Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks, increasing its cash position to $348 billion by May 2025. The company reduced its holdings in Apple by 50% and also sold shares in Bank of America and Citigroup. New positions were initiated in Constellation Brands, while existing stakes in Occidental Petroleum, SiriusXM Holdings, Pool Corp, and Verisign were increased. During the first quarter of 2025, Berkshire's purchases included additions to Verisign, Sirius XM, and Occidental Petroleum, as well as an estimated $2.7 billion investment in five Japanese trading houses.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 9 days. 13F filings are due 45 days after quarter end. Since Q1 2025 ended on March 31, 2025, the filing is due by May 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The specific threshold of 2,382,000 shares suggests this may be approximately Berkshire's current Domino's position. Given their Q1 2025 behavior, the status quo would be maintaining or reducing this position rather than adding to it.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire maintains its Domino's position at 2,382,000 shares or below, consistent with their Q1 2025 pattern of being a net seller and building cash reserves. They focus their limited buying activity on their stated priorities: Verisign, Sirius XM, Occidental Petroleum, and Japanese trading houses.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite their overall defensive posture, Berkshire adds to their Domino's position during Q1 2025 as part of their consumer staples strategy, viewing it as attractively valued. The purchase goes unreported in preliminary summaries but appears in the official 13F filing.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly suggests a No outcome. My research assistant reports that during Q1 2025, Berkshire was predominantly a net seller, increasing cash reserves to $348 billion while reducing major holdings like Apple by 50%. Their buying activity was highly selective and concentrated in specific names: Verisign, Sirius XM, Occidental Petroleum, and Japanese trading houses totaling $2.7 billion. Notably, Domino's Pizza is completely absent from this list of Q1 2025 purchases. The specific threshold of 2,382,000 shares in the resolution criteria suggests this is likely Berkshire's approximate current holding from a previous quarter, making it the baseline rather than a target to exceed. The overall pattern indicates Berkshire was being defensive and building liquidity, not initiating or expanding restaurant stock positions. For my forecast to be higher, I would need evidence of: (1) Domino's being mentioned in Q1 2025 purchase activity, (2) a clear value thesis for why Buffett would add to restaurants during a selling period, or (3) insider reports of the position being expanded. For it to be lower, I would need confirmation that Berkshire actually reduced the position. I'm assigning approximately 20% probability, acknowledging slight uncertainty since information could be incomplete and Berkshire occasionally makes unreported moves that surprise observers, but weighing heavily that the status quo of not adding significantly is most likely.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
