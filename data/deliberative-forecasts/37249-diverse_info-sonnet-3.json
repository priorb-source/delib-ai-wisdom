    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments I hadn't fully weighted, particularly regarding Politico's polling methodology. Forecaster 3's point about the smoothed average lagging behind individual polls is crucial - even if Reform surges in headline polls, translating that into a 4+ point lead in Politico's average requires sustained performance across multiple pollsters over weeks. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes the polling inertia and need for a catalyzing event. Both note that even recent individual polls show Reform only narrowly ahead or tied (~25-26%), not with the required 4-point cushion. The three-way cluster in the mid-20s means Reform would need both to rise AND see Labour/Conservatives fall significantly. However, I think 10-15% may be slightly too low given: (1) today's local elections could serve as the catalyst, (2) the 60 Conservative defections and by-election polling indicate genuine momentum, (3) two months allows for 2-3 polling cycles, and (4) unprecedented political volatility makes rapid shifts more plausible than in normal times.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm updating downward from 30% but not as low as 10%. The key insight I underweighted is Politico's smoothed averaging methodology. Even if Reform UK performs well in today's elections and surges in individual polls, the poll-of-polls average moves gradually and requires consistency across multiple pollsters over weeks. The current baseline shows Reform at ~25-26% in individual polls, sometimes tied with Labour but not with a 4+ point lead. To meet the resolution criteria, Reform would need to: (1) rise to ~28-30%, (2) see Labour fall to ~24-25%, (3) maintain this across multiple polls from different houses, (4) have this reflected in Politico's smoothed average. This is possible but requires both excellent election results today AND sustained momentum. The unprecedented political volatility and genuine momentum indicators (defections, by-election polling) keep the probability above 10%, but the technical barriers of the averaging methodology and the strict 4+ point requirement justify moving down from my original 30%. I'm settling at 18% as the right balance.",
