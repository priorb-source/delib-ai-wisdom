  "information": "On the continental level, the AfCFTA has achieved 92% consensus on trade rules, with 49 of 54 African countries having joined the agreement. To support implementation, initiatives such as the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) have been introduced. Within South Sudan, both the Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Trade have publicly advocated for ratification, with the Trade Minister reaffirming the government's commitment at an April 2025 summit. In February 2025, the East African Community (EAC) launched a new trade committee in South Sudan to help harmonize standards with the AfCFTA framework.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite public support from the government and business community, the legislative and bureaucratic processes required for formal ratification are not completed before the July 1, 2025 deadline. The bill may be stalled in parliament or delayed by other pressing domestic issues.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Leveraging the momentum from the April 2025 summit and pressure from the business community, the South Sudanese government fast-tracks the ratification bill through parliament. The President signs it into law, and the official instrument of ratification is deposited with the African Union Commission in June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong, recent, and high-level political will demonstrated by South Sudan, balanced against the significant logistical hurdle of a very short deadline. The status quo is that South Sudan has not yet ratified the agreement. Legislative and beaurocratic processes are often slow, and with less than two months until the deadline, inertia is a powerful force favoring a 'No' outcome.\n\nHowever, the evidence provided by my research assistant points to significant momentum. The Trade Minister's reaffirmation of commitment in April 2025 is a crucial and timely piece of information. This, combined with support from the Chamber of Commerce and the EAC's preparatory work in February 2025, suggests that ratification is a high-priority item. The broader continental context, with 49 other nations having joined, likely adds diplomatic pressure to finalize the process.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 65% because the timeline is extremely tight. We lack specific information on where the ratification bill currently stands within the legislative process. Any unforeseen political distraction or procedural delay could easily push the final ratification past the deadline. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 65% because ignoring the confluence of recent, positive indicators—explicit government commitment, business community support, and regional preparatory actions—would be a mistake. These factors strongly suggest a concerted effort is underway to push the ratification through, likely making it an exception to the typically slow pace of legislative action.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were official reports of the ratification bill being passed by parliament or signed by the President. I would decrease my forecast if reports emerged of a new domestic crisis taking precedence, or if a key government official expressed new reservations about the agreement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill South Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Star Worldwide via MSN: [World Chambers Africa Summit maps economic path for South Sudan](https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/other/world-chambers-africa-summit-maps-economic-path-for-south-sudan/ar-AA1CTigs?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if South Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn the continental level, the AfCFTA has achieved 92% consensus on trade rules, with 49 of 54 African countries having joined the agreement.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
