  "information": "The United Arab Emirates hosted an international Artemis Accords workshop in Abu Dhabi on May 21-22, 2025. Representatives from over 30 of the 55 signatory countries attended to discuss the implementation of the Accords' principles, including transparency, data sharing, and sustainability in space. In addition, the 2025 Humans to the Moon & Mars Summit (H2M2) was held in Washington, D.C., on May 28-29, bringing together leaders from government, industry, and international space agencies to discuss the future of human space exploration.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The outcome will be determined by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The number of signatories to the Artemis Accords remains at 55 through the end of June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing diplomatic efforts by the United States, no new country completes its internal review process and formally signs the Artemis Accords during the 30-day period of June 2025. Any potential candidates may have their signings scheduled for a later month.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A country, potentially one with an emerging space program or a remaining European nation, officially signs the Artemis Accords in a ceremony, likely at the U.S. Department of State in Washington, D.C., during June 2025, possibly as a follow-up to discussions at the recent H2M2 Summit.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on three main factors: the historical signing rate, recent diplomatic momentum, and key catalyzing events. First, the base rate of new signatories has been remarkably consistent, averaging approximately one country per month over the past year, with new signatories in both April and May 2025. This establishes a strong prior probability. Second, the Humans to the Moon & Mars Summit in Washington, D.C., at the end of May provides a significant catalyst. Such high-profile gatherings are prime opportunities for diplomatic announcements, as relevant officials from potential signatory nations are already present. The timing is ideal for a signing to occur in June. The status quo, however, remains a strong anchor; diplomatic processes are inherently slow and unpredictable, and a signing could easily be delayed past the narrow June window. My probability is not higher because there are no public announcements from a specific country confirming a planned June signing. It is not lower because ignoring the consistent signing rate and the opportune timing of the H2M2 summit would be overly pessimistic, given the sustained diplomatic push by the U.S. to expand the accords. I would increase my forecast with any official statement hinting at an imminent signing and decrease it if mid-June passes with no news or rumors.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025. There are 55 signatories at the time of this question: Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
