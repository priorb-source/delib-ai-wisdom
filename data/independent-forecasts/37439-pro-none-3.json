    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known by June 15, 2025, which is approximately one month from today's date of May 6, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No phone call between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is publicly acknowledged by both parties within the specified timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration's foreign policy apparatus determines that the preconditions for a presidential-level call with Vladimir Putin have not been met. They may opt for lower-level diplomatic engagement first or be consumed by other urgent domestic or international crises, pushing any potential call beyond the June 15 deadline. Alternatively, internal or allied pressure could persuade Trump to delay direct engagement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seeking to deliver on a major campaign promise to quickly end the war in Ukraine, President Donald Trump engages in direct personal diplomacy. A phone call is initiated with Vladimir Putin between May 12 and June 15, 2025, to open a direct channel of communication and explore possibilities for de-escalation or negotiation. Both the White House and the Kremlin subsequently issue statements confirming the call took place.",
    "rationale": "This forecast operates on the central assumption that Donald Trump is the sitting US President during the resolution period. The primary driver for a 'Yes' outcome is Trump's established preference for personal, leader-to-leader diplomacy and his repeated campaign promises to resolve the war in Ukraine rapidly, a task that would almost certainly require direct talks with Vladimir Putin. The May-June 2025 timeframe, roughly four months into a new administration, is a plausible window for such a significant foreign policy move after an initial period of assessment. However, the status quo, in which such high-level calls do not occur, remains the default outcome. Significant obstacles exist, including the short, specific time window of roughly one month, potential opposition from US allies and members of Trump's own national security team, and the sheer complexity of arranging such a sensitive call. The probability is not higher because of these substantial diplomatic hurdles and the specific time constraint; a call could easily be planned but slip into late June or July. The probability is not lower because Trump's political identity and core foreign policy promises are so strongly tied to the kind of direct action this question describes, making a call relatively early in his term a high-likelihood event. My forecast would increase with reports of back-channel talks to arrange a call, and decrease if the administration's public posture becomes more hostile towards direct engagement with Moscow.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other before June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [February 2025 Putin–Trump call](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_2025_Putin%E2%80%93Trump_call)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 12, 2025 and before June 15, 2025, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin speak on the phone with each other, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nBoth sides must acknowledge the phone call took place for it to count. \"Speak on the phone with each other\" is defined as both Trump and Putin, from different physical spaces, orally uttering words intended for the other individual into a telephone or equivalent device, those words being converted into electrical or digital signals in real time, and then transferred to the other individual via telecommunications links, where they are reconverted into sound waves at the other individual's listening device.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
