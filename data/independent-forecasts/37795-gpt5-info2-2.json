  "information": "The Rockies' 7-36 record through their first 43 games marked one of the worst starts in Major League Baseball's modern era. The team was on pace to finish the season with a 26-136 record, which would surpass the record for most losses in a season set by the 2024 Chicago White Sox (121 losses). Notable losses included a 21-0 defeat to the San Diego Padres, part of a three-game stretch where they allowed 55 runs, the most by any MLB team in a similar span since 1950. This followed seasons with 103 losses in 2023 and 101 in 2024. Pre-season PECOTA projections had forecast a .343 winning percentage for the Rockies in 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~27 days (until June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the Rockies remain at the bottom; their current and historical performance trajectory keeps them with the lowest MLB winning percentage by June 15.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Another cellar team (e.g., White Sox, Marlins, A’s, Nationals) collapses over the next 3–4 weeks while the Rockies play closer to .400, narrowing and then surpassing the gap. Alternatively, the Rockies go on an unusually strong hot streak (e.g., 10–5 or better over a 15-game span) while a peer goes 3–12, flipping the ranking.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies continue roughly .300–.350 ball against a generally tough NL West/summer schedule while other bad teams perform closer to .350–.400. Because Colorado started 7–36 (.163) — far below anyone else — the large early gap persists through mid-June, and ties at the lowest percentage would still satisfy the condition.",
    "rationale": "Baseline and momentum favor Yes. As of mid-May, Colorado’s 7–36 start (.163) is historically poor and, per the assistant’s report, among the worst modern-era 43-game starts. They’ve been blown out (e.g., 21–0) and allowed 55 runs over three games — signals of structural weakness (pitching depth, run prevention). They also entered 2025 with back-to-back 100+ loss seasons (103 in 2023, 101 in 2024), and PECOTA projected a .343 true-talent winning percentage. In other words, prior baseline was already bottom-tier, and early-season evidence suggests they’re even worse than that baseline. With only ~27 days to go, the current gap in winning percentage is large and unlikely to be erased by mean reversion alone.\n\nWhy not higher? MLB standings over a 3–4 week window remain volatile. One streak by Colorado (say, playing .450 for ~25–30 games) combined with a cold snap by another bad team could flip the bottom slot. Injuries returning, call-ups, or favorable short-term scheduling could lift Colorado modestly. There’s also rounding and tie scenarios to consider, although ties at the lowest percentage should still resolve Yes.\n\nWhy not lower? The Rockies’ early deficit is massive, and the team’s underlying quality (PECOTA ~.343, back-to-back 100+ loss seasons, severe run-prevention issues) makes a rapid, sustained climb less likely. Other probable cellar teams are bad but not catastrophically so; they would need both Colorado improvement and their own sharp deterioration to overtake the Rockies in a short window.\n\nWhat would move me up? Confirmation that as of late May/early June the Rockies still trail by a wide margin in win% (e.g., >.030 gap), continued tough matchups for Colorado, and signs that peer bottom teams are stabilizing around .350+. What would move me down? Evidence that another team is within 1–2 games in win% by June 1, a soft stretch or key returns for Colorado, or a major injury/sell-off hitting a peer that tanks their short-term performance.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
