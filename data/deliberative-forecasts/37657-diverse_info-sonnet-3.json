    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I hadn't fully weighted. Forecaster 2 provides crucial biological data: lab studies show HKU5-CoV-2 CAN bind human ACE2 receptors but with SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER efficiency than SARS-CoV-2. This is a concrete barrier to human infection that I underweighted. Forecaster 3 adds valuable taxonomic context - HKU5 viruses are merbecoviruses (same lineage as MERS-CoV, which does infect humans), providing some baseline plausibility. However, Forecaster 3's observation about ongoing SARI sequencing showing zero signals is strong negative evidence. Both emphasize the compound probability challenge: spillover must occur AND be detected AND sequenced AND attributed AND reported by credible sources - all within 45 days. The lower ACE2 binding efficiency is particularly significant when combined with the short timeframe and multiple detection hurdles.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward. The key new information is the confirmed lower ACE2 cell-entry efficiency compared to SARS-CoV-2, which represents a concrete biological barrier I hadn't fully appreciated. This compounds with: (1) the extremely short 45-day window, (2) zero current signals despite active post-COVID SARI sequencing in multiple countries, (3) the multi-step detection/reporting chain required, and (4) the base rate of ~4% for novel bat coronaviruses producing human cases within a FULL YEAR, which scales to approximately 0.5% for 6 weeks. The merbecovirus connection to MERS-CoV and confirmed ACE2 binding prevent this from going to 1% or below, maintaining a small tail risk. However, the lower binding efficiency is a significant enough barrier that I'm moving from 1.5% to 1.2%, closer to Forecaster 2's assessment while acknowledging the lineage-based risk Forecaster 3 identifies.",
