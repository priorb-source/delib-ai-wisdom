  "information": "According to reports from May 2025, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has achieved a 76% approval rating, making her the best-evaluated president since the 1994-2000 term. In specific areas, 63.4% of respondents positively evaluated her management of poverty reduction, and her administration's policies have been linked to a 24.9% reduction in homicides. However, on transparency and anti-corruption, 57.4% of respondents had a negative perception. Her administration has announced a $298 billion investment plan. Some polls cited her approval rating as high as 82%.\n\nA survey in Argentina conducted between April 28 and 30, 2025, by D'Alessio IROL/Berensztein indicated growing wear on Javier Milei's government. The survey showed his positive image has decreased to 44%, while his negative image has increased to 52%, for a net differential of -8%. 52% of respondents believe the economic situation is worse than the previous year. The evaluation of his government is divided, with 50% rating it as good and 48% as bad. Security Minister Patricia Bullrich has the highest positive image in the cabinet at 47%, as insecurity is the main social concern for 72% of respondents.\n\nAn international survey by Morning Consult conducted between January 21 and 27, 2025, placed Claudia Sheinbaum's approval rating at 66% and Javier Milei's at 65%. A later report from April 30, 2025, citing Morning Consult data, showed Milei's approval at 61% and Sheinbaum's at 60%. In the January survey, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had the highest approval rating at 75%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 45 days (until June 28, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes (Morning Consult’s latest cited snapshot has Milei 61% vs Sheinbaum 60% as of April 30, 2025).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "On or after June 28, Morning Consult shows Sheinbaum tied with or ahead of Milei. This could come from Sheinbaum sustaining or nudging up her approval (honeymoon period, positive security/economic headlines) while Milei softens a bit amid economic pain, protests, or political setbacks. Because ties resolve as No, even equal numbers would produce a No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On or after June 28, Morning Consult shows Milei ahead. This could occur if Argentine inflation and market indicators improve and Milei secures visible policy wins that keep him ~60–62% while Sheinbaum drifts to ~58–60% due to routine honeymoon fade or any negative news on governance/corruption or security, leading to a narrow Milei lead.",
    "rationale": "Both leaders are clustered near the top of Morning Consult’s tracker and have been within a point of each other: Jan 21–27, 2025 had Sheinbaum 66% vs Milei 65%, while an April 30, 2025 reference had Milei 61% vs Sheinbaum 60%. That makes the race essentially a coin flip with meaningful week-to-week noise. The resolution favors No in the event of a tie.\n\nStatus quo: As of the latest cited Morning Consult snapshot (Apr 30), Milei is narrowly ahead, which slightly favors Yes if nothing changes. However, the world tends to move slowly and both series are sticky around 60%, so small changes and rounding can flip the leader. Given a tie resolves to No, the asymmetry nudges the forecast below 50.\n\nEvidence from the research assistant that matters:\n- Sheinbaum: Domestic polls in May cite very high approval (mid-70s to low-80s in some surveys), strong marks on poverty reduction and security, and a large investment plan. Morning Consult has her lower (60–66%), but fundamentals look favorable for holding a high-approval equilibrium into early summer.\n- Milei: Domestic polling shows wear (e.g., net negative image, 44% positive/52% negative in late April). Morning Consult still had him high (61%), likely reflecting a different methodology and a base of resilient support. His trajectory depends on perceived macro stabilization vs. social costs of austerity.\n\nWhy not higher than my forecast? The tie-as-No rule and the close, noisy series reduce the chance of a Milei lead on a particular check date. Domestic Argentine polls suggest erosion that could eventually bleed into Morning Consult. Sheinbaum’s honeymoon and security/economic narratives raise the odds she is at least tied.\n\nWhy not lower? Milei already leads in the most recent cited Morning Consult snapshot, and improving inflation or visible legislative wins could keep him marginally ahead. Morning Consult has shown him stronger than many domestic polls, so a sharp drop is not my base case over the next six weeks.\n\nKey updates that would move me:\n- Up for Yes: Sustained Argentine macro improvements (inflation/growth), successful reform headlines, and Morning Consult weekly prints keeping Milei ≥61% while Sheinbaum stalls or ticks down.\n- Up for No: Morning Consult updates showing Sheinbaum ≥62% or a narrowing/negative trend for Milei (≤59–60%), or any negative Argentine political/economic shock; conversely, strong positive coverage in Mexico on security/economy.\n\nNetting these, I put modest weight on the status quo Milei lead but discount for tie risk and Sheinbaum’s fundamentals, landing slightly below 50%.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
