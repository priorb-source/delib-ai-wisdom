    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "UFC 316 likely scheduled for late 2025, so approximately 3-7 months from now (May 26, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The fight between Joe Pyfer and his opponent (likely Kelvin Gastelum based on the article) is currently scheduled for UFC 316 and will take place as booked",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The fight gets cancelled due to injury or other issues and Pyfer doesn't fight at UFC 316, OR Pyfer fights but loses his bout by decision, knockout, or submission",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Joe Pyfer competes at UFC 316 and defeats his opponent (likely Kelvin Gastelum) via knockout, submission, or decision, or defeats a replacement opponent if there's a late change",
    "rationale": "Based on the article, a fight has been rebooked for UFC 316 involving Joe Pyfer after a Mexico cancellation. For this to resolve Yes, two conditions must be met: (1) Pyfer must actually compete at UFC 316, and (2) he must win that fight. The primary risk to condition 1 is typical MMA fight cancellations due to injuries, weight cut issues, or other problems - historically around 15-20% of booked fights don't happen as scheduled. However, UFC typically finds replacement opponents when possible, which increases the likelihood Pyfer fights someone. For condition 2, without detailed information about the specific matchup, recent fighter form, or betting lines, I must estimate Pyfer's win probability as roughly even to slightly favorable, around 50-55%, given he's an active UFC middleweight in what appears to be a competitive matchup. Combining these factors: ~85% chance the fight happens × ~53% chance he wins if it happens = ~45% overall probability. This forecast isn't higher because of inherent fight cancellation risks and competitive uncertainty in MMA bouts. It isn't lower because the fight is already booked and there's no information suggesting Pyfer is likely to withdraw or is significantly overmatched. I would update higher with confirmation of good health, favorable betting lines, or opponent issues; I would update lower with injury news, fight cancellation, or analysis showing a very difficult matchup.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Joe Pyfer defeat someone at UFC 316?\n\nQuestion background:\nSports Illustrated: [UFC 316 adds rebooked fight after last-minute Mexico cancellation](https://www.si.com/fannation/mma/news/ufc-316-rebooked-fight-kelvin-gastelum-joe-pyfer-mexico-cancellation)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Joe Pyfer defeats someone at [UFC 316](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_316).\n\nIf Pyfer does not fight anyone at UFC 316, this resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-26.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
