    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that have caused me to reconsider my initial forecast. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the observable nature of amphibious preparations and the catastrophic economic consequences aligns with my reasoning. However, Forecaster 3 raises the most important point I initially underweighted: the resolution criteria's linguistic precision. The question requires not just military action, but specifically GROUND military forces AND a US public accusation of INVASION. This is more restrictive than general conflict risk. Many escalation scenarios - naval blockade, air strikes, coast guard actions, or maritime militia operations - would not meet this threshold. Additionally, Forecaster 3 correctly notes that even if limited ground force action occurred, the US might use calibrated language like 'incursion' or 'military action' rather than explicitly accusing China of 'invasion,' especially for limited scenarios like outlying island seizures. This linguistic specificity meaningfully raises the bar for resolution. However, I'm not fully convinced by Forecaster 3's 1% estimate. If actual PLA ground forces landed on Taiwan-controlled territory, I assess the US would very likely characterize this publicly as an invasion to rally international support and justify its response. The difference between our forecasts is marginal at this low probability range, but the linguistic precision argument is persuasive enough to warrant an update downward from my initial position.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I am updating my forecast downward from 3% to 2%. The key insight from the deliberation is that the resolution criteria is more restrictive than I initially weighted. The requirement for both ground military forces AND explicit US accusation of invasion creates a higher bar than general cross-strait conflict risk. While I maintain that the base rate for such an event in 57 days remains very low given the absence of mobilization indicators, the linguistic precision matters. That said, I believe 2% better captures the tail risk than 1%. If PLA ground forces actually invaded Taiwan in any meaningful way, the geopolitical incentives for the US to publicly label it an invasion are strong - doing so would be critical for coalition building, sanctions justification, and demonstrating resolve. The US would not likely soft-pedal such a consequential event. My 2% forecast accounts for: the extremely short timeframe, lack of observable preparations, immense costs to China, but also genuine tail risks from miscalculation, crisis escalation, or unforeseen triggers. The structural barriers remain enormous, but cannot be dismissed entirely in such a volatile security environment.",
