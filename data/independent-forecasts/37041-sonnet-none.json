    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 38 days (from April 24, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - North American countries do not currently have CDC yellow fever travel advisories, and yellow fever is not endemic in North America",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Yellow fever cases mentioned in the PAHO alert remain confined to South American countries. Any sporadic cases in Central America or Mexico are contained quickly and don't reach the threshold for CDC to issue a Travel Health Notice. The 38-day timeframe proves too short for any outbreak to develop, be detected, and trigger an advisory.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The rising yellow fever cases spread northward from South America to Central American countries or Mexico. An outbreak develops rapidly in one or more North American countries with sufficient case numbers and geographic spread that CDC determines a Travel Health Notice is warranted. This could be accelerated if the outbreak was already underway but not yet publicly reported when PAHO issued its March 31 alert.",
    "rationale": "The PAHO epidemiological alert from March 31, 2025 indicates rising yellow fever cases 'in the Americas,' which is concerning but doesn't specify North American involvement. Historically, yellow fever has not been endemic in North America, though suitable mosquito vectors (Aedes aegypti) exist in parts of Mexico and Central America. The critical factor is the very short timeframe - only 38 days. For a CDC Travel Health Notice to appear by June 1, an outbreak would need to: (1) already be developing or imminent, (2) be detected and confirmed, (3) reach sufficient severity, and (4) be processed through CDC's assessment system. While PAHO's alert suggests something significant is happening in the broader Americas region, the status quo strongly favors no current yellow fever advisories for North American countries. The probability is not lower because: the PAHO alert is recent and specific, climate change may be expanding vector ranges, and Central American countries are geographically vulnerable to spillover from South America. The probability is not higher because: 38 days is a very compressed timeframe for epidemic development and bureaucratic processes, there's no current evidence of North American involvement, and yellow fever has historically been absent from this region. I would update higher if: reports emerge of confirmed yellow fever cases in Mexico or Central America, or if the PAHO alert is clarified to explicitly include North American countries. I would update lower if: subsequent reports clarify cases are limited to South America, or if no additional alerts are issued in the next 2-3 weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any North American country be listed as having a CDC yellow fever travel advisory on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[PAHO issues new epidemiological alert amid rising yellow fever cases in the Americas](https://www.paho.org/en/news/31-3-2025-paho-issues-new-epidemiological-alert-amid-rising-yellow-fever-cases-americas)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country in North America is listed as having a travel advisory by the Centers for Disease Control at its [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices) page when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
