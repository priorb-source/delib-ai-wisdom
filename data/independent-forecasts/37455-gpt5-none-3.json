    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 55 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite the April 2025 license, Starlink delays flipping Lesotho to “Available” on the map due to post-license steps (type approval paperwork, local partner/onboarding, payments/logistics setup, tax/import compliance, or simple website/update lag). The map continues to show “Coming Soon” through June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink completes post-license formalities quickly and begins accepting orders for Lesotho. The availability map updates to show at least part of Lesotho as “Available” in May or June, even if distribution is limited or a soft launch via direct online orders is used.",
    "rationale": "Time left is short but sufficient for a fast-follow launch. Lesotho reportedly granted a Starlink license in mid-April 2025, which removes the primary regulatory blocker. Historically, once licensed, Starlink has sometimes moved from approval to the map showing “Available” within a few weeks, though in other cases it has taken months. With ~55 days remaining, a quick launch is feasible but not guaranteed. The status quo today appears to be that Lesotho is not yet marked “Available,” so if nothing changes, the outcome is No. Reasons to lean Yes: (1) license already granted; (2) Starlink’s network coverage is global and does not require major new local infrastructure; (3) Lesotho is small and could be turned on with minimal incremental operational burden; (4) demand case (rural, mountainous terrain) aligns with Starlink’s value proposition. Reasons for caution: (1) post-license steps (type approval, taxation/FX, e-commerce enablement, logistics) can add weeks; (2) Starlink sometimes staggers launches and website updates; (3) small market size could reduce prioritization; (4) ambiguity over whether the map update will occur by end of June even if commercial arrangements are in progress. I did not receive any additional concrete updates from the research assistant beyond the license report, so I’m weighting the status quo moderately and the mixed historical cadence of Starlink country launches. Not higher: because onboarding and map-update lags have pushed rollouts past 2 months in some countries. Not lower: because the main barrier (regulatory approval) appears resolved, and Starlink can often move quickly once licensed. I would move up if we see signs such as: Starlink enabling checkout for Lesotho addresses, local partner announcements, or Starlink updating timing to Q2/“Available soon.” I would move down if: the Starlink map explicitly shifts Lesotho to a later window (e.g., H2 2025), regulatory conditions surface (e.g., mandated local gateway/partner), or there are reports of import/type-approval delays.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Lesotho as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lesotho grants license to Musk's Starlink](https://www.ewn.co.za/2025/04/14/lesotho-grants-license-to-musks-starlink)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Lesotho listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
