  "information": "South Sudan signed the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement in 2019 but, as of early May 2025, is one of the few states that have not deposited their instruments of ratification with the African Union. The ratification process requires a bill to pass the Transitional National Legislative Assembly, be signed by the President, and have the formal instrument lodged with the AU Commission. Historically, South Sudan's legislative processes can be lengthy; for example, the country took six years to ratify the Maputo Protocol.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until June 30, 2025, inclusive)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No – South Sudan remains among the few AU members that have not deposited instruments of ratification with the AU Commission.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ratification bill is not introduced or not prioritized in the Transitional National Legislative Assembly; or it passes but either presidential assent or preparation/deposit of the instrument lags, so nothing is lodged with the AU before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The executive fast-tracks a ratification bill, TNLA passes it swiftly, the President signs promptly, and the Ministries of Justice/Foreign Affairs prepare and deposit the instrument with the AU in Addis Ababa ahead of July 1—possibly spurred by economic forums, EAC integration goals, or AU pressure for universal ratification.",
    "rationale": "- What I know: Per the research assistant, South Sudan signed AfCFTA in 2019 but, as of early May 2025, has not deposited instruments of ratification. Ratification requires TNLA passage, presidential assent, and formal deposit with the AU. South Sudan’s legislative processes are often slow (e.g., Maputo Protocol took six years).\n- Time constraint: Roughly two months remain, and completion requires multiple sequential steps plus a formal deposit. Any delay at one stage could push this beyond the deadline.\n- Status quo weight: The country has not ratified for nearly six years post-signature, indicating low institutional priority or capacity constraints. Inertia usually dominates over short windows.\n- Why not lower: It’s still plausible the government seeks a quick symbolic win on economic integration. Ratifications can be fast-tracked when politically prioritized; external pressure from the AU/EAC and recent business summits could catalyze action. The legal act of ratification is lighter than full implementation, so it can move quickly if leadership pushes.\n- Why not higher: There is no public evidence (per the assistant’s note) that a ratification bill is on the order paper, nearing a vote, or that the deposit process is being prepared. South Sudan’s governance bandwidth is limited and competing priorities (political transition, security, fiscal issues) often delay such measures. Even after passage, preparing and depositing instruments can take weeks.\n- What would change my view upward: Credible reports that (a) Cabinet has approved and transmitted the ratification bill to TNLA, (b) the bill is scheduled for readings or has passed, (c) the President has assented, and especially (d) the Ministry confirms that instruments are ready for imminent deposit or the AU Treaty database updates to show receipt.\n- What would change my view downward: Signs of parliamentary recess or gridlock, lack of any movement by late May, government focus on other urgent bills, or reports that technical work on the instrument is not underway.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill South Sudan ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Star Worldwide via MSN: [World Chambers Africa Summit maps economic path for South Sudan](https://www.msn.com/en-xl/africa/other/world-chambers-africa-summit-maps-economic-path-for-south-sudan/ar-AA1CTigs?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if South Sudan ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSouth Sudan signed the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement in 2019 but, as of early May 2025, is one of the few states that have not deposited their instruments of ratification with the African Union.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
