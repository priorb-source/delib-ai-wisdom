    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identified the central tension: the 68-day resolution window for this recall is very close to the historical median for similar recalls, suggesting a baseline probability near 50%. We all highlighted the same key factors: the limited geographic scope and allergen-based nature of the recall argue for a faster resolution ('Yes'), while the large volume, long production window, and frozen nature of the product argue for a slower one ('No'). The primary disagreement is in the final weighting. Forecaster 2 leans slightly optimistic (55%), while Forecaster 3 and I lean slightly pessimistic (48% and 40%, respectively). I found Forecaster 3's introduction of a 'status quo weighting' particularly insightful. This heuristic argues that since closure requires a specific bureaucratic action, any delay or inaction defaults to a 'No' outcome, giving 'No' a slight edge in a near-even scenario. This is a compelling argument that I had not explicitly formulated.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am updating my forecast. My initial forecast of 40% was likely too pessimistic and under-weighted the significant positive impact of the recall being limited to a single state, which greatly simplifies the verification process. The other forecasters correctly anchored the problem closer to a 50/50 proposition based on the historical data showing about half of comparable recalls close within 70 days.\n\nHowever, I am persuaded by Forecaster 3’s reasoning to remain slightly below 50%. The 'status quo bias' is a valid consideration in any process requiring active bureaucratic sign-off. For the recall to close ('Yes'), FSIS must successfully complete all its effectiveness checks and paperwork without significant delay. Conversely, for the recall to remain open ('No'), any number of issues—such as difficulties tracing product from the long production window, delays in verifying disposal, or simply administrative backlog—can be the cause. The aggravating factors specific to this case (65,000 lbs of frozen product that could be in distributor or consumer freezers) make such minor delays more likely than not. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast to acknowledge that a 'Yes' outcome is very plausible, but I am setting it slightly below 50% to reflect that the path to a 'No' outcome has more potential failure points.",
