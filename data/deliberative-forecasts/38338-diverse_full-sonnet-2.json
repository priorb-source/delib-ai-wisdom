    "review": "Forecasters 2 and 3 raise several compelling arguments I underweighted in my initial analysis. Most importantly, Forecaster 3's point about the 3-month campaign timeline is devastating to the Yes case - if Morgan truly prefers a brief campaign for a November 2026 race, announcing in June 2025 (17+ months out) contradicts his own stated strategy. This should have been central to my analysis. Both forecasters also correctly emphasize that Morgan's mid-May statement about 'observing the field' suggests a deliberate, patient approach incompatible with a 25-day decision window, especially since Jolly just announced on June 5. The argument that party formation could be entirely separate from his own candidacy is also well-taken - I may have conflated these initiatives too much. Their framing of the 'default is No' given the short timeline and Morgan's 2018/2022 track record properly places the burden of proof on the Yes scenario.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward significantly based on three key insights from the other forecasters: (1) The 3-month campaign timeline Morgan mentioned strongly suggests he would announce much later (mid-2025 or early 2026), not 17 months before the election; (2) His stated intent to 'observe the field' with Jolly having just announced June 5 implies his observation period will extend well past July 1; (3) The base rate from 2018 and 2022 non-entries is stronger than I initially weighted. However, I'm not going quite as low as 12% because Morgan's recent engagement has been notably more concrete than previous cycles - he provided a detailed campaign blueprint to Politico, is actively working on party formation, and is receiving significant media attention about this specific race. These actions create a non-trivial possibility of an announcement in the next 25 days, even if unlikely. My updated forecast balances the strong arguments against an early announcement with the real political activity Morgan is currently undertaking.",
