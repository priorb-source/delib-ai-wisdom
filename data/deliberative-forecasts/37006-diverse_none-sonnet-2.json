    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis closely mirrors my own, emphasizing the massive 22-seat deficit and structural advantages favoring the Bloc. Forecaster 3 raises important counterpoints I underweighted: specifically mentioning that 'late 2024 polling often showed CPC gains in Quebec' and emphasizing the volatility of three-way races under FPTP. This is concrete information about recent momentum that adds meaningful uncertainty. However, I note that Forecaster 3's concern about CPC momentum doesn't directly address whether the Conservatives can leap from 10 seats to 33+ seats - even strong gains (say, doubling to 20 seats) wouldn't be enough if the Bloc holds 21+. The question isn't whether CPC improves, but whether they specifically overtake the Bloc's seat count. Forecaster 3's 65% seems to overweight the uncertainty and underweight the magnitude of the required swing.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I maintain that the structural factors strongly favor the Bloc winning more seats than the Conservatives. The 22-seat gap from 2021 (32-10) is enormous. Even generous CPC gains would require the Bloc to collapse substantially for the Conservatives to overtake them in seat count. While Forecaster 3 correctly identifies that recent polling shows CPC momentum in Quebec, this doesn't necessarily translate to the specific outcome of beating the Bloc in seats. The Bloc's vote efficiency in francophone ridings, established regional strength, and the fact that any Liberal surge (per the Carney article) would hurt the Bloc but benefit Liberals rather than Conservatives, all support the status quo. The article about Conservative candidate problems in Quebec City actually reinforces CPC organizational weakness. However, I do acknowledge Forecaster 3's valid point about increased uncertainty from national CPC momentum and three-way race dynamics. This warrants a modest downward adjustment from my initial 82% to account for scenarios where unexpected swings occur. My updated forecast of 76% reflects that while the Bloc remains strongly favored, there is somewhat more realistic downside risk than I initially assessed.",
