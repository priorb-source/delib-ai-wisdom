    "review": "Both forecasters lean on the short horizon and lack of observable preparations at Punggye‑ri as decisive, which I agree with. Forecaster 3 adds the idea that the unprecedented 7.5+ year pause suggests a structural shift in DPRK’s testing strategy; that’s a useful framing, though not conclusive. Forecaster 2’s thresholds (needing tangible site activity to go >20%, and a floor near 15% due to unpredictability) push me to re‑examine my lower bound. Neither adds concrete new indicators of imminent testing, but they reinforce two considerations: (1) DPRK can act on short notice; and (2) geopolitical cover from Russia/China limits marginal sanction risk, which could marginally raise near‑term odds. Overall, their reasoning is largely consistent with mine; I find their probabilities slightly high given the two‑month window without site signatures, but their arguments justify a modest upward nudge from my prior.",
    "rationale": "Key factors remain: (1) Time is short (~61 days). Historically, pre‑test signatures (e.g., equipment flows, cable‑laying, water pumping, increased personnel) are often detectable days to weeks in advance; none are publicly reported. (2) Punggye‑ri is likely capable, and DPRK’s weapons testing tempo and rhetoric are elevated, keeping a non‑trivial tail risk. (3) International costs of a test may be somewhat blunted by Russia/China shielding at the UNSC, slightly increasing the near‑term feasibility compared to earlier years. (4) The long pause could reflect a strategic shift away from explosive testing, which weighs against a test on this short timeline. Given these, I keep the probability low but edge it up to reflect residual short‑notice risk and the geopolitical context. I would update sharply upward on credible imagery of preparations or official warnings of imminence; I would tick down further if the site remains quiet through mid‑June or if DPRK substitutes other provocations without Punggye‑ri activity.",
