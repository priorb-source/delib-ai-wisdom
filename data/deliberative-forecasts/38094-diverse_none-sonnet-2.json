    "review": "Both forecasters arrived at very similar conclusions (3-4%), which validates the general reasoning. Forecaster 2 makes the strongest new argument I hadn't fully weighted: Fetterman's documented health history (stroke during 2022 campaign) creates a senator-specific tail risk for resignation that's higher than baseline. This is a concrete, evidence-based factor. Forecaster 3's 4% forecast acknowledges slightly more tail risk scenarios including theoretical expulsion from caucus or strategic independence moves. However, I find some of these scenarios (like Democratic leadership expelling him) to be highly speculative without supporting evidence. Both correctly note the institutional benefits of maintaining caucus membership and the rarity of mid-term switches. The health argument is the most compelling update to my initial analysis.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm maintaining my 3% forecast. While Forecaster 2's health history argument is valid and I should have weighted it more explicitly, the 33-day timeframe significantly constrains even elevated health risks. Health-related resignations typically involve visible warning signs, hospitalizations, or announced leaves - none of which have been reported. For party switching, all three of us agree there's no concrete evidence beyond tensions, which historically are insufficient to predict such dramatic moves. The convergence of all three forecasts at 3-4% increases my confidence in this range. The explicit denial of resignation, institutional incentives to maintain caucus membership, and extremely low historical base rates for such changes in compressed timeframes all support staying at the lower end of this range.",
