    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I underweighted. Forecaster 2 correctly emphasizes the critical distinction between 'limiting' versus 'terminating' the program - the question specifically asks about termination, and current executive actions are only limiting eligibility. The fact that the March 7 executive order hasn't resulted in 'complete' status strongly suggests the tracker requires actual termination, not just limitations. Forecaster 3's point about the rulemaking timeline is also important - the first committee meeting occurs essentially at the deadline (June 30-July 2), with final rules expected later in 2025, making this path impossible. Both forecasters appropriately weighted the near-impossibility of Congressional action in 1.5 months for a major program termination. Forecaster 2's 2% feels slightly too pessimistic given the non-zero chance of surprise must-pass legislation, while Forecaster 3's 10% appropriately balances unlikely scenarios. My 18% now seems too optimistic - I didn't fully account for the termination vs. limitation distinction and underweighted the impossibly short timeline for Congressional action or complete rulemaking processes.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I'm updating significantly downward. The key insights that moved me are: (1) The specific requirement for 'termination' rather than just 'limiting' - the March 7 executive order limited the program but the tracker still shows 'in progress', indicating high standards for marking 'complete'. (2) The impossibly compressed timeline - achieving statutory termination requires Congressional action within 1.5 months, which is extremely unlikely even with must-pass legislation. (3) The rulemaking path is definitively too slow, with the first meeting at the deadline and final rules months away. (4) The historical base rate for terminating major federal programs through emergency legislation in under 2 months is essentially zero. I'm maintaining a small non-zero probability for black swan scenarios like PSLF termination being attached to emergency must-pass legislation or the tracker unexpectedly marking functional gutting as 'complete', but these are remote possibilities. The most likely outcome by far is that the tracker remains 'in progress' on July 1.",
