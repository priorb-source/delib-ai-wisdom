    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no bankruptcy petition filed by ChargePoint Holdings, Inc. in the U.S. before the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ChargePoint operates through Q2 CY2025 using existing liquidity and cost controls, possibly taps an ATM/strategic financing or amends covenants if needed, and continues serving customers; no immediate maturities force action, so no petition is filed before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden liquidity shortfall or covenant breach triggers acceleration or vendor tightening; efforts to raise capital fail, leading the company to retain restructuring advisors and file a Chapter 11 petition before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon is short. With roughly two months left, the base rate for a discrete event like a bankruptcy filing is low unless there are clear, near-term triggers.\n- Status quo favors no filing. Companies typically telegraph distress (missed payments, covenant breaches, retention of restructuring advisors, going-concern imminence) before a filing. Absent such signals, the default path over a short window is continuation.\n- Recent results context. The company just reported FY2025 Q4/full-year results (fiscal year likely ended Jan 31, 2025). Firms in immediate danger often signal it in their 10-K/press release via going-concern language or urgent liquidity warnings. Without evidence of an acute cash crisis, a filing within weeks is less likely. \n- Access to capital and levers. Even distressed issuers can often extend runway via ATM equity, supplier terms, inventory and opex reductions, or covenant amendments—tools that can push out a filing beyond July 1.\n- Why not higher: ChargePoint is a known distressed EV infrastructure name with pressured margins and historical cash burn, but immediate catalysts for a filing within the next 57 days are not evident here. The combination of just-reported results and typical lead times for bankruptcy reduces near-term hazard.\n- Why not lower: Industry headwinds (EV demand volatility, hardware reliability transitions, funding delays) and potential covenant/working-capital pressures leave a non-trivial tail risk of an abrupt liquidity event. If lenders tighten or capital markets shut, a quick filing remains possible.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of covenant breaches or forbearance negotiations; missed/extended interest or principal payments; retention of restructuring advisors; suppliers tightening terms; explicit going-concern warnings that imply runway shorter than the window to July 1.\n- What would move me down: Announced capital raise or strategic investment; debt maturity extensions/covenant waivers; positive operating cash flow inflection or materially improved gross margins; explicit disclosure of sufficient liquidity well beyond mid-2025.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional information was provided, so this forecast leans on base rates, the short time window, and typical distress dynamics.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill ChargePoint file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[ChargePoint Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1777393/000177739325000009/chpt8-kerfy2025q4exx991.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if ChargePoint Holdings, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
