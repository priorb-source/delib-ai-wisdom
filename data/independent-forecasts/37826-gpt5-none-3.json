  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No attack into Pakistan proper; any violence remains limited to the Line of Control/PAK-administered Kashmir or is non-kinetic/covert.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Routine India–Pakistan tensions persist. There may be small-arms or mortar exchanges along the LoC in Kashmir, counterinsurgency operations inside Indian-administered J&K, and harsh rhetoric, but no Indian Armed Forces strike into Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during June 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major provocation—such as a mass-casualty terror attack inside India credibly linked to Pakistan-based militants—triggers a limited, punitive response. India conducts an airstrike on a camp near Balakot (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) or a precision artillery/missile strike across the international border into Pakistani Punjab or Baluchistan, reported by reputable media or acknowledged by either side, within June 2025.",
    "rationale": "Baseline and time window: Kinetic strikes by India into Pakistan proper are rare. The notable modern precedent is the 2019 Balakot airstrike (in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) following the Pulwama attack; the 2016 ‘surgical strikes’ were across the LoC in Pakistan-administered Kashmir (not in the specified provinces). Given a one-month window, the prior is low absent a precipitating event. The world usually changes slowly, so status quo (no strike) deserves extra weight. \nEscalation incentives and constraints: India has strong incentives to deter cross-border terrorism but faces significant escalation and international diplomatic costs for attacks into Pakistan proper, particularly given the nuclear backdrop. Since the 2021 reaffirmed ceasefire, cross-border firing along the international border has generally been limited; most flare-ups remain on the LoC or within Indian territory. That favors No. \nWhy not higher: • No known current trigger of Pulwama-scale severity. • High political/diplomatic/military costs and escalation risks for striking Pakistan proper. • Very narrow time window (June only). \nWhy not lower: • There is precedent (2019). • Summer months can coincide with increased infiltration/violence in J&K, which could raise pressure for a visible response. • Domestic political incentives can, in rare cases, favor limited punitive strikes. \nWhat would raise my forecast: • A mass-casualty attack in India with credible attribution to Pakistan-based groups. • Official Indian attributions and emergency security cabinet meetings; unusual IAF/air-defense readiness; temporary airspace closures; evacuation advisories near the IB; Pakistani alerts or CAPs over K-P/Punjab. • Breakdown of the ceasefire extending from the LoC to the international border. \nWhat would lower my forecast: • Continued quiet across both the LoC and IB into mid-June. • Clear de-escalatory signaling or productive backchannel/diplomatic engagement. • Absence of any significant terror incidents inside India. \nResearch assistant note: No additional information was provided beyond the question background, so this forecast leans on historical base rates, structural incentives, and the short time window.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack in Pakistan proper in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [2025 India–Pakistan conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_India%E2%80%93Pakistan_conflict)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if after May 31, 2025 and before July 1, 2025 the Indian Armed Forces execute a kinetic attack on targets in one of the following provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Baluchistan, Punjab, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nTo count, an attack must be [kinetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_military_action), using explosive weaponry or physical violence. Non-kinetic actions such as a cyberattack would not count, even one resulting in deaths.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
