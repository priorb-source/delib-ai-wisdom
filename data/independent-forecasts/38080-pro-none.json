    "no_outcome_scenario": "The legal battle between Harvard and the Trump administration continues without a decisive short-term ruling. The courts do not grant an emergency injunction, or they move too slowly for a decision to be made and implemented by July 1, 2025. The administration refuses to back down, leaving the revocation in place.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Harvard's lawsuit succeeds in securing a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction from a federal court. The judge rules that the administration's action likely exceeded its authority or violated due process, and that the irreparable harm to thousands of students warrants immediately reinstating the SEVP certification while the full case is litigated.",
    "rationale": "While the status quo is that Harvard's certification is revoked, this forecast gives a higher probability to a reversal before the deadline. The primary driver for a 'Yes' outcome is swift and successful legal action. The administration's move to revoke certification is an extreme measure that inflicts immediate, severe, and irreparable harm on approximately 6,800 students. This is a classic predicate for a court to issue a temporary restraining order (TRO) or preliminary injunction. Federal courts, especially in high-profile cases involving executive action, can act very quickly, making the short timeframe of one month a surmountable obstacle. The legal arguments against the administration's action appear strong, likely centering on the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which prohibits arbitrary and capricious government actions, as well as potential First Amendment violations related to academic freedom. The action seems clearly punitive and politically motivated, which judges are often skeptical of. My probability is not higher because the executive branch holds significant authority over immigration and national security matters, and a court could choose to defer to the administration's judgment. Furthermore, the legal process is inherently uncertain, and any number of delays or adverse rulings are possible. The probability is not lower because the harm is so severe and the government's legal footing appears so weak that the case for emergency judicial intervention is compelling. An update towards 'Yes' would be prompted by the case being assigned to a judge with a history of checking executive power. An update towards 'No' would follow news of the court denying a TRO or scheduling hearings for after the resolution date.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
