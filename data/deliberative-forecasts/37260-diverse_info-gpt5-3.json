    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a useful detail about the motion lacking majority support in January and breaks down the multi-step path (referral, admissibility, decision) that would all need to occur within ~60 days—this reinforces the timing constraint. Their 4% seems high given no filing exists and no signs of fast-track proceedings. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on the political cost (AfD polling in mid-20s) is a relevant drag on the chance of even initiating proceedings, and their 1% aligns with the legal/timing realities. Neither presents evidence of a formal application or court signals of expedition, which would be necessary to move materially higher.",
    "rationale": "Core drivers remain: (1) No formal application has been filed by any authorized actor (federal government, Bundestag, or Bundesrat). (2) The Federal Constitutional Court’s party-ban proceedings historically run many months to years; a final verdict by July 1 would require unprecedented acceleration. (3) Politically, banning a party polling ~25% is extraordinarily fraught, reducing near-term appetite to file. (4) BfV classification enabling surveillance does not translate into a ban. The additional point from Forecaster 2 about lacking majority support in the Bundestag slightly strengthens the already dominant “no filing/no time” thesis, but not enough to change the bottom-line probability meaningfully. Upside risk exists only via an extreme shock prompting an immediate, consensus-backed filing and unheard-of expedited handling by the Court—still very unlikely within two months. I’m maintaining my forecast at 1%.",
