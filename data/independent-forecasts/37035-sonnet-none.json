    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 39 days (from April 23, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Colombia remains at Level 2 (Practice Enhanced Precautions)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The yellow fever outbreak remains contained to rural or endemic regions, primarily affecting local populations. The CDC monitors the situation but determines that current Level 2 precautions are sufficient. Colombia implements effective mosquito control and vaccination campaigns, preventing spread to urban centers or major tourist areas. The outbreak does not significantly threaten international travelers.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The yellow fever outbreak escalates dramatically, spreading to Bogotá or other major urban tourist destinations. Cases surge exponentially, with multiple confirmed infections among international travelers. Healthcare infrastructure becomes strained, and the CDC determines the risk warrants Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) or Level 4 (Do Not Travel) designation within the next 5-6 weeks.",
    "rationale": "Strong status quo bias favors maintaining Level 2. The CDC has already assessed Colombia and determined Level 2 is appropriate, suggesting awareness of the yellow fever situation without deeming it severe enough for escalation. Historically, CDC raises travel notices to Level 3+ only for exceptional circumstances like COVID-19 or major Ebola outbreaks - situations with widespread transmission posing immediate threats to travelers. Yellow fever, while serious, is endemic in parts of Colombia and vaccine-preventable. The base rate for Level 3+ designations is very low. The short 5-6 week window makes rapid escalation less likely - significant deterioration would need to occur quickly. However, the active outbreak mentioned in the article and the 'economic emergency' framing prevent assigning near-zero probability. For me to update higher, I would need evidence of urban spread, multiple traveler cases, or CDC statements suggesting imminent action. For lower probability, I'd need outbreak containment reports or declining case numbers. The combination of strong status quo bias, short timeline, low base rate of Level 3+ designations, and the CDC's existing calibrated response at Level 2 heavily weights toward No, though the active outbreak situation maintains some residual risk.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Travel Health Notice status of Colombia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/colombia), which is \"Level 2 Practice Enhanced Precautions\" at the time of this question, is a level of greater than 2 when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
