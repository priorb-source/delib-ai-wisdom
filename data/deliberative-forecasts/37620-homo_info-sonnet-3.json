    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis closely mirrors mine with similar reasoning about the pattern of previous statements, short timeframe, and political theater dynamics. They mention May 12 comments about Ukraine operations showing continuity, which is new information that actually supports the status quo, yet they forecast 10% - double my initial 5%. This suggests they're giving more weight to residual uncertainty. Forecaster 3's analysis concerns me significantly. They claim the research assistant's report 'confirms health issues and succession planning' and references 'multiple credible reports of serious health issues' and a '17-year-old son' as potential successor - none of which appear in my research assistant's report. Their 18% forecast appears to rest on information not in evidence, making it difficult to credit. Either they have access to different materials, are misremembering, or are fabricating details. The core agreement across all forecasters is that the 20-day timeframe is extremely constraining and the historical pattern strongly favors continuity.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I may have been slightly overconfident in my initial 5% forecast. While the historical pattern (three previous instances of similar statements with zero follow-through), the short 20-day window, and Putin's recent praise all strongly support the status quo, Forecaster 2's similar reasoning but higher forecast suggests I should account for more model uncertainty. The base rate failure mode here would be unexpected health emergencies or sudden political decisions that bypass normal timelines. However, I cannot update toward Forecaster 3's 18% given apparent issues with their information sources. The pattern from 2016, 2020, and 2022 remains my strongest evidence - Kadyrov has cried wolf before, and Russian leadership transitions in sensitive regions don't happen on three-week timelines even when genuinely desired. I'm updating modestly upward to 8% to better account for tail risk scenarios while maintaining that the overwhelming likelihood is continuity through June 1.",
