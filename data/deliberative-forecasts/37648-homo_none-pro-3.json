    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, have converged on an identical forecast of 35% based on very similar reasoning. This consensus stems from a shared interpretation of the core tension in the question: a strong status quo and tight deadline favoring 'No' versus a single, powerful piece of intelligence favoring 'Yes'. Both other forecasters correctly identified the Israeli media report as a significant signal suggesting advanced negotiations. They raised two subtle but important points I hadn't explicitly articulated: first, that a more limited, de-escalatory agreement is the most plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome given the timeline (Forecasters 2 & 3), and second, that the media report itself could be a deliberate leak intended to sabotage the talks by mobilizing opposition (Forecaster 2). Their reasoning is highly convincing and aligns with my own, reinforcing the initial analysis.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of the other forecasters, I am maintaining my forecast of 35%. The deliberation process did not introduce new evidence but did add valuable nuance that reinforces my original conclusion. The strong consensus at 35% suggests this figure represents a robust synthesis of the limited information available.\n\nMy reasoning remains unchanged. The baseline probability is low due to the extremely short timeframe (under two months) and the well-documented political opposition to a deal in both the US and Iran. However, the intelligence reported by Israeli media—that senior ministers were briefed on a 'high chance' of a deal—is a signal strong enough to warrant a significant update from that low baseline. \n\nThe points raised by my colleagues sharpen this analysis. The idea of a 'limited deal' makes the short timeline more credible, supporting the 'Yes' case. Conversely, the idea of the leak being an act of 'sabotage' adds another potential failure point, supporting the 'No' case. In my view, these two points effectively cancel each other out in terms of a directional update. The risk of sabotage is one of many political failure modes already encompassed by the 65% probability of 'No'. The core assessment remains a balance between the powerful inertia of the status quo and a single, credible report indicating a high probability of a breakthrough. For these reasons, I am confident in holding my forecast at 35%.",
