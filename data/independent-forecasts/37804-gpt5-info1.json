    "no_outcome_scenario": "CDC removes or revises its Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations page so that it no longer recommends 0.7 mg/L (e.g., recommends <0.7 mg/L, makes no recommendation, or pulls the page with no replacement) before July 1, 2025",

    "rationale": "- What we know: In April 2025, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to instruct CDC to stop recommending community water fluoridation. HHS said it would convene the Community Preventive Services Task Force (CPSTF) to study and issue a new recommendation. EPA is reviewing new scientific information on fluoride risks, and FDA has begun steps to phase out ingestible fluoride tablets/drops. As of May 20, there is no indication the specific CDC recommendation page has already changed.\n\n- Status quo and inertia: The CDC’s longstanding recommendation is 0.7 mg/L (since 2015). Large federal public health guidance changes, especially those touching many stakeholders, typically take time (internal clearance, coordination with CPSTF, consistent messaging across CDC pages, and consideration of legal/reputational risk). The fact that ~40 days have passed since the announcement without a reported change increases the odds that the recommendation remains in place through July 1.\n\n- Forces toward a rapid change: The HHS Secretary publicly signaled intent to stop recommending fluoridation, and related agency moves (EPA review; FDA phase-out of fluoride tablets/drops) indicate a broader policy shift. If HHS issues a formal directive for CDC to pause/withdraw the recommendation pending review, CDC could update or pull the page quickly, yielding a No.\n\n- Balancing considerations: CPSTF review will likely take months, which favors leaving the current CDC content in place for now. Abrupt removal of a high-visibility recommendation could generate significant pushback from professional bodies and states and could create immediate operational confusion. These considerations, plus observed inertia to date, modestly outweigh the political impetus over the next six weeks, but the explicit intent to halt recommendations keeps the risk of a quick change non-trivial.\n\n- Why not higher: There is explicit, recent top-level intent to stop the recommendation; interagency actions suggest coordination; a web page change could be executed in days, not months.\n- Why not lower: No clear evidence of an imminent CDC change; CPSTF has not yet reported; substantial bureaucratic and stakeholder frictions typically slow reversals; and we’re on a short timeline to July 1.\n\n- What would move me up: Public statements from CDC indicating no immediate change pending CPSTF; CPSTF scheduling or scoping that clearly pushes any recommendation revision past July; credible reports of internal resistance or delayed HHS directives.\n- What would move me down: A formal HHS directive to CDC to pause/withdraw the recommendation; any CDC update or placeholder language signaling “no current recommendation”; EPA releasing new risk findings prompting an immediate precautionary stance; the CDC page going offline or being reworded to remove 0.7 mg/L.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn April 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
