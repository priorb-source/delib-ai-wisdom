    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses are strong and highly convincing. We are in complete agreement on the fundamental drivers of this forecast: the persistent political paralysis in Lebanon, the failure to implement reforms required since the April 2022 Staff-Level Agreement (SLA), and the extremely short one-month timeline until the resolution date. They correctly highlight that the base rate of inaction over more than three years is the most powerful piece of evidence. Their consensus on a lower probability forecast of 5% has compelled me to critically re-evaluate my initial forecast of 12%, as their reasoning more accurately reflects the immense difficulty of breaking such an entrenched stalemate in such a short period.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downwards from 12% to 5%. The deliberation with my peers convinced me that my initial forecast gave too much weight to the abstract possibility of a last-minute \"desperation deal.\" As the other forecasters effectively argued, the Lebanese political elite has consistently demonstrated for over three years its capacity to absorb immense economic pressure while blocking the necessary reforms to protect entrenched interests. The \"constant pressure\" of the crisis has become the status quo, not an effective catalyst for change. With only one month remaining and no new information suggesting a shift in political will, the probability of overcoming years of gridlock to pass complex and contentious legislation is exceptionally low. A 5% chance more accurately reflects the deep entrenchment of the political stalemate and aligns my view with the strong consensus that a 'Yes' outcome is highly improbable.",
