  "information": "A proposal to ban the 'Tush Push' play, initially submitted by the Green Bay Packers, was discussed at the NFL's annual meeting in early April 2025. The proposal was tabled after receiving support from 16 of the NFL's 32 teams, short of the 24 votes required to pass a rule change. The proposal is scheduled to be revisited at the spring league meeting on May 20-21, 2025, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 3 weeks. The key event, the NFL spring league meeting, is scheduled for May 20-21, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The 'Tush-Push' play is currently legal in the NFL.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "At the NFL spring league meeting on May 20-21, 2025, the proposal to ban the 'Tush-Push' fails to secure the required 24 votes from team owners. The opposition bloc holds firm, and proponents fail to sway a sufficient number of undecided teams, leaving the play legal for the upcoming season.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Between the April and May meetings, proponents of the ban successfully lobby at least eight additional team owners by emphasizing player safety and competitive balance concerns. At the meeting on May 20-21, the proposal receives 24 or more votes, and the NFL subsequently announces the rule change before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the high threshold required to change a rule in the NFL and the outcome of the initial vote. The status quo, where the play is legal, is the default outcome. Any rule change requires a supermajority of 24 out of 32 owners (75%), a deliberately high bar. According to the provided research, a proposal to ban the play in April 2025 received only 16 votes, falling 8 votes short. This indicates that while there is significant support for a ban (50% of the league), there is an equally large bloc that is currently unconvinced or opposed. Gaining 8 additional votes in the short period between the April and May meetings is a difficult task without a significant new catalyst, such as new compelling injury data or a shift in stance from a highly influential figure. The probability is not lower because securing 16 'yes' votes demonstrates substantial momentum and that this is a serious proposal, not a fringe issue. The fact that the vote is being revisited so quickly also suggests proponents believe they have a realistic chance to sway others. My forecast would increase if there were public reports of influential, previously undecided teams flipping to support the ban. It would decrease if proponents appeared to lose support or if the league office signaled a desire to maintain the status quo for another season to gather more data.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the NFL ban the \"Tush-Push\" before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nESPN: [Vote on tush push ban tabled by NFL owners for more discussion](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44490292/sources-tush-push-ban-vote-tabled-nfl-owners) | CBS Sports: [Expansive 'Tush Push' ban could have strong support at NFL's next owners meeting, per report](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/expansive-tush-push-ban-could-have-strong-support-at-nfls-next-owners-meeting-per-report/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Football League officially approves or announces a rule restricting the quarterback sneak known as the [Tush-Push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sneak#Tush_push) before June 1, 2025. If there are no reports of this occurring before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA proposal to ban the 'Tush Push' play, initially submitted by the Green Bay Packers, was discussed at the NFL's annual meeting in early April 2025. The proposal was tabled after receiving support from 16 of the NFL's 32 teams, short of the 24 votes required to pass a rule change. The proposal is scheduled to be revisited at the spring league meeting on May 20-21, 2025, in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
