  "information": "The recall was initiated by Johnsonville LLC on April 5, 2025, for approximately 22,672 pounds of its cheddar bratwurst product due to potential contamination with hard plastic. The affected products were produced on a single date, February 5, 2025, and bear the establishment number 'Est. 1647'. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) classified this as a Class I recall, indicating a high health risk. The recall was prompted by two consumer complaints, but no confirmed injuries have been reported. The product was distributed to retail locations in ten states: Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The FSIS has noted concerns that the product may still be in consumers' freezers.\n\nThe FSIS follows a structured process for closing recalls. This process involves verifying that the recalling firm has notified all its customers, confirming that the product has been removed from circulation, conducting effectiveness checks to ensure the product is no longer available to consumers, and verifying that the company has implemented corrective actions. For Class I recalls, which are deemed high-risk, the FSIS enforces more rigorous verification requirements before it can be closed. Recalls involving foreign material contamination necessitate a comprehensive investigation into the source of the contaminant and the implementation of effective preventive measures.\n\nHistorical data on similar FSIS recalls provides context for typical closure timelines. Many previous recalls handled by Johnsonville were closed within 4 to 8 weeks. Broader data for Class I meat recalls of a similar size often shows closure within 2 to 4 months after the announcement. However, some cases can take longer; a recall for Tyson Fun Nuggets in 2023 took approximately four months to close. A January 2025 report from the Plastic Pollution Coalition also mentioned that several recalls from 2024 involving plastic contamination remained ongoing for several months after their initiation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 52 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall remains Active on July 1 because FSIS extends effectiveness checks across multiple states, requests additional corrective actions from Johnsonville, or the recall scope is expanded following new consumer complaints or findings of more lots affected. Ongoing concern about product in consumers’ freezers prolongs the Active status.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Johnsonville completes customer notifications and product removal; FSIS verifies effectiveness and corrective actions without scope expansion, and updates the recall page status to Closed in mid-to-late June 2025.",
    "rationale": "The recall began April 5, 2025, covers a single production date, about 22,672 pounds, distributed to 10 states, and is Class I for potential hard plastic contamination. No injuries have been confirmed. According to the assistant’s research, Johnsonville recalls have often closed in 4–8 weeks, and similar Class I meat recalls of this size typically close in 2–4 months, though some plastic-related recalls have taken several months and a notable Tyson case took ~4 months. The question is whether the FSIS page flips from Active to Closed before July 1, roughly 12.5 weeks after initiation. That sits well within the common 2–4 month window and slightly beyond the upper end of Johnsonville’s historical 4–8 week range, making closure by late June plausible. Factors pushing toward Yes: single-day production lot, moderate volume, experienced firm, no injuries, and typical FSIS timelines suggest mid-to-late June is feasible. Factors holding me back from a higher probability: Class I recalls get stricter verification; foreign-material cases sometimes spur additional complaints or scope expansions; FSIS noted concern about product in consumers’ freezers, which can lengthen Active status while effectiveness checks and corrective actions are verified. Why not higher: The tail risk of scope expansion or extended verification for foreign material could easily push closure into July. Why not lower: There’s no signal of injuries or multi-lot/systemic issues; the size and scope are bounded, and Johnsonville’s track record suggests timely closure is achievable. What would move me up: FSIS updates indicating completed effectiveness checks, retailer lists finalized with product recovered, or Johnsonville publishing corrective action details without expansions. What would move me down: Any recall expansion, new complaints or injuries, or FSIS notices implying difficulties in verification or additional affected production dates.",
