    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my reasoning: severe legal/process constraints, strong norms against caretaker candidacies, weak polling, no campaign groundwork, and very little time. They both keep a nontrivial tail for a late ‘draft’ scenario driven by PPP elite maneuvering. New angles they surfaced: the independent/emergency nomination pathway and a clearer checklist of signals that would move probabilities (party rule-bending, endorsements, scheduled resignation). However, neither introduces concrete new evidence (e.g., credible reports of PPP changing rules or Han assembling a team). Their assessments therefore reinforce, rather than change, my base view.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is roughly 12–13 days, and the status quo strongly favors no announcement. He missed the PPP primary registration, leadership has said he won’t be included, norms discourage a caretaker run, polls are poor with high unacceptability, and there’s no visible campaign infrastructure. While a factional ‘draft Han’ effort exists, making a late pivot procedurally possible, it would still require rapid elite coordination, likely rule-bending, and a resignation by May 4. The resolution only requires an announcement, but announcing without a clear path and immediate resignation would invite backlash and seems unlikely given Han’s cautious signaling. Since the other analyses add no dispositive new facts and mainly corroborate the constraints and the narrow tail where PPP orchestrates a last-minute draft, I’m not updating. Watchpoints remain: explicit PPP moves to create an emergency draft, top-leader endorsements, visible campaign build-out, or Han scheduling a resignation/press event. Absent these, No remains the default.",
