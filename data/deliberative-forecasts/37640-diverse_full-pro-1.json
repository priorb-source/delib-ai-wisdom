    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement, with forecasts of 87%, 89%, and my initial 90%. The reasoning is highly convergent, focusing on the short timeline versus the long, standard process for decommissioning a federal website. However, the other forecasters raised several points that sharpened my own analysis. Forecaster 2's distinction between 'program elimination' and 'website decommissioning' as separate processes with different timelines is a valuable clarification. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly convincing, introducing two crucial points I had not sufficiently weighed: 1) The strong positive incentives to keep the domain online (even as a static page) to communicate the program's closure and avoid consumer/manufacturer confusion, and 2) The technical detail that the resolution source ('Is It Down Right Now?') would almost certainly resolve a redirect or a static 'this program has ended' page as 'Yes'. This significantly narrows the pathway to a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 90% was based on the high friction of decommissioning a federal website, including legal and procedural hurdles, which would be difficult to overcome in the short time before the resolution date. The deliberation with my peers has reinforced this view and caused me to increase my confidence. The key insight from the discussion is that the most likely outcome, even if the program is rapidly 'eliminated', is not a complete domain takedown. Instead, converting the site to a static archive or redirecting it to a new EPA page is the easiest and most practical option from a technical, legal (NARA/FOIA compliance), and communications standpoint. Crucially, any of these likely scenarios would result in the resolution source reporting the site as 'UP,' leading to a 'Yes' resolution. A 'No' outcome now seems even less probable, as it would require the administration to not only bypass months of standard procedure for a symbolic win but also to choose the most technically and logistically difficult option—a complete digital erasure—over simpler alternatives. I am therefore updating my forecast upward to reflect a higher degree of confidence in the 'Yes' outcome.",
