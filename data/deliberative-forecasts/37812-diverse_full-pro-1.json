    "review": "The other two forecasters provide excellent, well-structured analyses that arrive at a conclusion similar to my own. There is a strong consensus that a 'Yes' outcome is unlikely, with all forecasts falling within a narrow 15-18% band. I found two points particularly clarifying: Forecaster 2's explicit calculation of the baseline (39 destinations) plus confirmed additions (5) to arrive at an expected total of ~44, which quantifies the remaining gap at 8+ destinations. Forecaster 3's identification of the specific 'missing pillars' (Qatar, Kuwait, Saudia, etc.) provides a concrete list of the carriers whose return is necessary to reach the threshold. Their reasoning is highly convincing and reinforces the core argument that the combination of a large current deficit, a short timeframe, and a poor security/demand environment makes exceeding 51 destinations a significant challenge.",
    "rationale": "My original forecast of 15% was based on the significant gap between the current number of destinations (~39) and the required threshold (>51), coupled with the negative catalysts of ongoing security risks and weak passenger/tourism data. The analysis from the other forecasters has prompted me to refine my view slightly. Specifically, their structured approach highlights that reaching the target is not about a gradual trickle of new routes, but rather the rapid, coordinated return of several major airlines ('missing pillars'). A significant de-escalation in regional tensions could act as a single trigger event, prompting carriers like Saudia, Qatar Airways, and Lufthansa Group to quickly relaunch services to capture peak summer travel demand. While the probability of such a trigger event in the next six weeks remains very low, the other analyses have convinced me that I was slightly underweighting the possibility of this 'lumpy' and rapid recovery scenario. The core logic of my forecast remains unchanged—a 'No' is the most probable outcome—but I am adjusting upward to better reflect this low-probability, high-impact path to 'Yes'. I am therefore increasing my forecast from 15% to 17%, aligning more closely with the group's consensus.",
