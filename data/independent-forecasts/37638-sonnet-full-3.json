  "information": "The Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which aims to ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program. The bill, authored by Senator Charles Perry and supported by Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, passed the Senate on May 7, 2025, with a 25-6 vote and was sent to the House State Affairs Committee. Proponents cite concerns over public health and safety regarding unregulated high-THC products. Lt. Gov. Patrick has stated he will push for a special legislative session if a ban is not passed during the regular session. The proposed law would make possession of consumable hemp products punishable by up to one year in jail and a $4,000 fine.\n\nThe Texas House of Representatives has shown resistance to a full THC ban, instead advancing measures to expand medical cannabis access. House Bill 46 (HB 46), which broadens the state's Compassionate Use Program, was approved by the House with a vote of 118-16. This bill expands the list of qualifying medical conditions, increases the number of licensed dispensaries to 11, and gives military veterans special access to low-dose THC treatments. Furthermore, a House committee adopted a substitute version of the Senate's SB 3 that is not a full ban, but would allow certain low-THC beverages and tinctures while prohibiting vapes and synthetics. The Texas hemp industry, estimated to be worth $8 billion, and Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller have expressed concerns that a total ban would shutter thousands of businesses.\n\nThe Texas Legislature's regular session is scheduled to end on May 26, 2025, leaving a narrow window for new legislation to pass through all required procedural steps in both chambers and be signed by the governor. While Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick has threatened to force a special session, only Governor Greg Abbott can officially call one and set its agenda. As of mid-May, Governor Abbott's stated public priorities for the session did not include a THC ban. Public opinion appears to favor more access; a University of Houston survey found that 62% of Texans support marijuana legalization and 79% support a comprehensive medical marijuana program. Veterans' groups have also testified in opposition to a ban, citing THC products as an alternative to opioids.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "47 days until July 1, 2025. The Texas legislative regular session ends in 12 days on May 26, 2025, which is the main window for this outcome to be determined, though a special session could theoretically occur before July 1.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Texas currently does not have a full ban on THC sales, and maintaining the status quo means no new prohibition becomes law before July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The House continues to resist the Senate's full ban approach. The modified version of SB 3 that allows certain low-THC products (but isn't a full ban) either passes or the bill dies in committee. The regular session ends May 26 without a full ban being enacted. Governor Abbott does not call a special session, or if he does, a THC ban is not on the agenda or fails to pass.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The House reverses course and passes the original Senate version of SB 3 as a full THC ban within the remaining 12 days of the regular session. After reconciliation between chambers, Governor Abbott signs it into law. Alternatively, Abbott calls a special session dedicated to this issue where both chambers pass and he signs a full ban.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. The House has already demonstrated clear opposition to a full ban by: (1) passing HB 46 to expand medical cannabis access by a wide margin (118-16), and (2) adopting a substitute version of SB 3 that specifically avoids being a full ban. With only 12 days remaining in the regular session, the legislative process timeline is extremely tight for such a contentious issue requiring House-Senate reconciliation.\n\nKey factors weighing against a ban: The $8 billion hemp industry creates strong economic incentives against prohibition. Public opinion strongly opposes a ban (62% support legalization, 79% support medical marijuana). Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller and veterans' groups actively oppose it. Most importantly, Governor Abbott has not publicly prioritized a THC ban among his legislative goals.\n\nThe main pathway to Yes would be a special session, but only Governor Abbott can call one and set its agenda. Lt. Gov. Patrick's threat to push for one doesn't guarantee it happens or that it would focus on THC. Given Abbott's stated priorities don't include this issue, a special session focused on THC prohibition seems unlikely.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the House has already taken concrete steps to block a full ban, time is extremely limited, and the governor hasn't championed this cause. My forecast is not lower (and sits at 15% rather than 5%) because: (1) the Senate passed SB 3 decisively (25-6), showing strong support in one chamber; (2) Lt. Gov. Patrick appears highly committed; (3) unexpected political developments could occur in 12 days; and (4) a special session, while unlikely, remains theoretically possible before July 1.\n\nI would update higher if: Abbott publicly endorses the ban, the House committee reports out the original SB 3 with full ban language, or Abbott announces plans for a special session with THC on the agenda. I would update lower if: the modified SB 3 passes the House, the regular session ends without action, or Abbott explicitly rules out a special session on this topic.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe Texas Senate passed Senate Bill 3 (SB 3), which aims to ban nearly all forms of THC outside the state's limited medical marijuana program.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
