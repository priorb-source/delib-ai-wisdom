    "review": "Both forecasters make largely the same structural case I did: start from a sub-50% retention base rate for recalls that reach the ballot, then adjust downward given the unusually severe and high-salience allegations, the sheriff’s public statement, and recent Colorado small-town precedents. New or sharpened points they added: (1) an explicit consideration that a pre–Election Day resignation would produce a No outcome; (2) the potential countervailing effect of mail-ballot turnout skewing toward older, status-quo–oriented voters; (3) the possibility of self-defense–sympathetic voters; and (4) the recall petition’s qualification as evidence of preexisting mobilization. I find their reasoning generally convincing and consistent with my own priors. Of their additions, the resignation scenario, if anything, nudges the probability of Metz retaining slightly lower; the older-homeowner/status-quo turnout point is plausible but speculative and counterbalanced by activist-driven recall turnout in very small electorates. None of the arguments introduce concrete new information that would materially shift my estimate.",
    "rationale": "Starting from ~40% baseline retention for recalls that make the ballot, I adjust downward for: (a) the gravity and salience of the allegations (teen shot; sheriff says no criminal intent by the teen), (b) sustained negative media attention, (c) evidence of organized opposition (petition qualification), and (d) recent Colorado recall successes in small towns. Small-N electorates increase variance, and there is some chance of due-process or self-defense sympathy plus potential status-quo bias among mail voters, but I judge these as insufficient to outweigh the headwinds. A low but nonzero chance of resignation before May 20 also points away from a Yes resolution. With no polling and ballots already out, I retain a cautious, removal-leaning stance. No decisive new evidence from the other forecasters warrants a change to my estimate.",
