  "information": "The 31% additional ad valorem duty for Swiss products was officially listed under subheading 9903.01.60 of the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS). On April 10, 2025, the U.S. administration announced that the country-specific tariffs, including the one for Switzerland, would be suspended for 90 days to allow for negotiations. This suspension period is scheduled to run until July 9, 2025, covering the June 1 resolution date. The HTS listing for Switzerland under subheading 9903.01.60 reflects the 31% rate but is marked as 'suspended'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 38 days from April 24, 2025 to June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the 31% tariff rate is currently listed in the HTS under subheading 9903.01.60, though suspended",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. government completely removes the 31% tariff listing from the Harmonized Tariff Schedule before June 1, or changes the rate to a different percentage through administrative action or policy reversal",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The status quo continues where the 31% tariff rate remains listed in the HTS through June 1, regardless of whether the suspension continues or is lifted. The listing persists as it currently exists",
    "rationale": "The critical insight here is that the resolution criteria explicitly state 'Whether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.' According to my research assistant, the 31% tariff for Switzerland is currently listed under subheading 9903.01.60 but marked as suspended through July 9, 2025. This suspension period covers the June 1 resolution date. Since the question only asks whether the 31% rate is LISTED (not whether it's active), the current status quo directly satisfies the resolution criteria. For a No outcome, the administration would need to either completely remove the Switzerland tariff from the HTS or change the rate from 31% to something else. Given that the 90-day suspension was just announced on April 10 (only 14 days ago), it seems highly unlikely the administration would make another major policy change before June 1. Suspensions are typically used to maintain leverage during negotiations while preserving the policy option - removing the listing entirely would eliminate that leverage. Administrative changes to tariff schedules also require formal processes that typically take longer than 38 days. My forecast is not higher (95%+) because there remains some tail risk of unexpected policy reversals, administrative errors, or technical changes to the HTS system. My forecast is not lower (70% or below) because the status quo very clearly satisfies the resolution criteria, time is limited for major changes, and the recent suspension suggests the administration wants to preserve this tariff as a negotiating tool rather than eliminate it. I would update higher if I saw evidence the administration explicitly committed to maintaining the tariff listing through June, or lower if I saw signals they were considering complete removal rather than just suspension",
