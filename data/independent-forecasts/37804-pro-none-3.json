    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The HHS review, expedited due to political pressure, releases a preliminary recommendation to lower the optimal fluoride level to below 0.7 mg/L, or advises removing the recommendation altogether pending further study. In response, the CDC updates its webpage to reflect this new guidance or takes the page offline before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The HHS review process is still ongoing by the resolution date. Lacking a new formal recommendation, and given the slow nature of bureaucratic and scientific review, the CDC maintains its existing guidance of 0.7 mg/L on its website through July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is institutional inertia and the very short timeline. The resolution date is just over a month away. Major public health recommendations from entities like the CDC are based on extensive scientific review and are not changed hastily. The current 0.7 mg/L recommendation from 2015 was itself the result of a lengthy review process. The new HHS review, prompted by political figures, is unlikely to complete its work, reach a consensus, formulate a new recommendation, and have the CDC formally adopt and publish it by July 1, 2025. Government scientific reviews typically take many months, if not years. Therefore, the status quo is highly likely to remain in place on the resolution date.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 90% because the announcement of the HHS review introduces a non-trivial level of uncertainty. There is a small but real chance that political pressure could lead to an accelerated, perhaps preliminary, decision to change the guidance or to simply remove the page 'pending review', either of which would resolve the question as 'No'.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 90% because the timeline is the dominant constraint. Changing such a foundational public health guideline in under three months (from the review's announcement in early April to the July 1 deadline) would be an unprecedented break from standard scientific and administrative procedure. The weight of existing scientific consensus and bureaucratic process strongly favors the status quo within this timeframe.\n\nI would increase my probability forecast if the CDC or HHS issued a statement confirming the 0.7 mg/L recommendation would remain in effect during the review. I would decrease it if there were credible reports of the review being fast-tracked or if a preliminary finding against the current level were leaked from the panel.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
