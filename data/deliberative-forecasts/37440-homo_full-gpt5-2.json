    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: the regular session ended without passage; an extended session for the budget begins May 12; moving election policy now would require expanding scope or calling a special session. I found Forecaster 2’s process emphasis and triggers to move up/down well-calibrated and consistent with my view. Forecaster 3 adds a useful wrinkle about the possibility of using budget-related vehicles, which marginally increases the path diversity for a “Yes,” though I agree it’s atypical for election policy. Where I diverge from Forecaster 3 is on magnitude: bumping to 25% seems high given the late-session withdrawal of CS/HB 1381 (a signal of either legal/implementation concerns or deprioritization) and the absence of a declared special-session call for elections. The breadth of the resolution criteria (HB 831-type measures counting) keeps the odds above near-zero, but the procedural and timing headwinds still dominate.",
    "rationale": "Time left is under two months, and the default outcome after regular session adjournment is No. To get to Yes, leadership must either: (1) expand the agenda of the budget-focused extension to include election policy, (2) tuck relevant language into an implementing/conforming bill (possible but unusual for this subject), or (3) call a targeted special session. Republicans have the votes and a governor inclined to sign, and national GOP pressure provides some incentive. However, the late withdrawal of CS/HB 1381 suggests internal hesitation or concern about NVRA exposure and litigation/administrative burden—factors that make a rapid push less attractive in a compressed window. The bar for resolution is relatively low (e.g., an HB 831-style ID notation would count), so I allow a nontrivial tail for a quick, symbolic measure if leadership decides to act. Still, absent concrete signals (session call including election policy, filed revival language, or public commitments by the Governor/Speaker/Senate President), the procedural hurdles and timing keep the odds modest. I slightly uptick my estimate to reflect the additional path via budget-related vehicles highlighted by others, but I continue to weight the regular-session failure and scope constraints more heavily.",
