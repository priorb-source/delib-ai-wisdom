    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days (from June 4, 2025 to June 27, 2025)",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "The debt remains below $37 trillion if the current debt level is significantly lower than expected (e.g., below $36.5 trillion) and there is an unusual slowdown in government spending or unexpected revenue surge in late June 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The debt exceeds $37 trillion through normal continuation of current trends, where the debt continues growing at its typical rate of $4-6 billion per day due to ongoing structural deficits and regular government operations.",
    "rationale": "With only 23 days until resolution, this forecast relies heavily on understanding the current trajectory of US debt. Based on historical patterns through 2024, the national debt was approaching $36 trillion by late 2024 and has been growing at an average rate of $1.5-2 trillion annually, or approximately $4-5.5 billion per day. Since we're in early June 2025, the debt is very likely already at or near $36.8-36.9 trillion. To reach $37 trillion by June 27 would require only $100-200 billion in additional growth over 23 days, or roughly $4-9 billion per day - well within normal parameters. The US continues to run structural deficits with no significant policy changes that would dramatically alter spending patterns in such a short timeframe. My forecast is not higher (near 100%) because there remains some uncertainty about the precise current debt level and the possibility of measurement timing issues or unexpected fiscal events. It's not lower because the debt growth is highly predictable and mechanical, driven by legislated spending and entitlements, and 23 days provides very little time for meaningful deviation from trend. I would update higher if I had confirmation the current debt is already above $36.9 trillion, and would update lower only if evidence emerged of current debt significantly below $36.7 trillion.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US national debt be greater than $37 trillion on June 27, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBase rate information can be found at [Merchant Wholesalers, Except Manufacturers' Sales Branches and Offices: Durable Goods: Furniture and Home Furnishings Inventories/Sales Ratio](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/R4232IM163SCEN).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the value for Total Public Debt Outstanding at the Debt to the Penny chart at the US Treasury's [Debt to the Penny](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/debt-to-the-penny) tracker for June 27, 2025 is greater than or equal to $37,000,000,000,000.\n\nIf the resolution source does not report that specific date, then the resolution will be based on the amount corresponding with the first date after it.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
