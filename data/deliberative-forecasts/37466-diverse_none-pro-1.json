    "review": "My initial forecast of 3% was based on the high inertia of geographic names, counteracted by the single piece of evidence that WorldAtlas already acknowledges the name 'Gulf of America' in an article title. I have now reviewed two other forecasters. \n\nForecaster 2 (40%) bases their entire analysis on a 'recent executive order' changing the name. This information was not in the prompt, and my own search reveals no such order. This appears to be a false premise, making their high forecast and rationale unconvincing and inapplicable to the question as presented. \n\nForecaster 3 (1%) presented a rationale very similar to my own, emphasizing base rates, inertia, and the short timeframe. Their reasoning was clear and well-structured. The most persuasive point they made, which I had not weighted as heavily, was the significant operational and editorial distinction between an article title and a primary map label. They argued that changing a map label is a much higher bar, often tied to major site redesigns, for which there is no evidence. This makes the propagation of the name from the article to the map less likely than I initially assumed.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I am updating my forecast downward. My initial 3% was driven by the fact that WorldAtlas explicitly uses '(Gulf of America)' in an article title, suggesting an editorial awareness and acceptance that makes a change more plausible than if the name were completely absent. However, Forecaster 3's analysis rightly convinced me that I underestimated the inertia and the higher threshold required to change a primary, graphical map label versus a textual article heading. Such a change on a major map page is a more significant decision and is unlikely to occur in the short ~54 day window without a strong catalyst, like the (non-existent) executive order mentioned by Forecaster 2. The existing parenthetical in the article title still prevents me from dropping to 1%, as it indicates a non-zero possibility of the name being used in a site-wide consistency update. However, the probability of such an update being implemented on the specific North America map page before July 1, 2025, is extremely low. I am therefore revising my forecast from 3% down to 1.5%, reflecting a greater weight on the status quo and the high bar for changing map labels, while still acknowledging the single piece of evidence that points, however weakly, towards a potential change.",
