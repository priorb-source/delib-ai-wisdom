    "review": "All three forecasters converged on remarkably similar reasoning and forecasts (12%, 18%, 12%). We all emphasized: (1) Dodik's extensive history of referendum threats without actual scheduling, (2) the short 2-month timeframe, (3) absence of current crisis indicators, (4) strong international constraints, and (5) the low bar of merely requiring an announcement. Forecaster 2's slightly higher 18% forecast doesn't appear to be based on different evidence or substantively different reasoning - rather, it seems to reflect typical forecaster variance within a narrow range. No new evidence or arguments were raised that I hadn't already considered. The tight clustering around 12-18% validates that this range is reasonable, but the lack of any actual indicators of imminent action, combined with the extremely strong historical pattern of rhetoric-without-follow-through, supports staying at the lower end of this range.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm maintaining my 12% forecast. The convergence of analysis strengthens my confidence that this is the appropriate probability. Forecaster 3 independently arrived at the exact same forecast using similar logic, which validates my reasoning. Forecaster 2's 18% appears to be normal forecaster variance rather than being driven by distinct evidence or arguments. The key factors remain: (1) Dodik has threatened referendums repeatedly for over a decade without ever officially scheduling one - this base rate is overwhelming, (2) we're only 2 months from resolution with zero current indicators of imminent action, (3) the research assistant found no additional information suggesting anything unusual, (4) international pressure has historically been effective at preventing escalation beyond rhetoric. The 12% accounts for genuine tail risk - that Dodik could make a sudden announcement for political leverage, that regional dynamics could shift rapidly, or that the low bar (just requiring an announcement) makes this marginally more likely than holding an actual referendum. But absent any concrete indicators, maintaining 12% appropriately balances the very strong status quo with the inherent uncertainty in volatile geopolitical situations.",
