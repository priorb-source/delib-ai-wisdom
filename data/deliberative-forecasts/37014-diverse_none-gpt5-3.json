    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully highlights the specific Electoral Calculus projection and Kent’s Brexit-leaning demographics, but I think they overweight a single modeled estimate. Treating one model’s “predicts control” as >50% odds isn’t warranted without cross-confirmation, especially given known issues converting Reform’s support into seats under FPTP and their relatively thin local organization. Forecaster 3’s caution aligns more with my priors: new parties typically underperform in local seat conversion, and local polls/models are noisier. I also agree with their focus on slate coverage and ground game as key constraints. The main incremental point from both is that we’re close to election day and there is at least one concrete model pointing to Reform doing very well, which nudges me up from a very low prior. But I still find the evidence insufficient to approach their 30% (let alone 70%) without corroboration (additional polls, candidate coverage confirmation, or credible local indicators).",
    "rationale": "Baseline remains that KCC has historically been strongly Conservative and Reform has no track record of topping seat counts in county councils. FPTP and multi-party fragmentation typically penalize new entrants’ seat efficiency, and local ground game plus incumbency matter a lot. The key swing factor is the Electoral Calculus projection reported by KentOnline. I treat that as a single, model-based signal rather than definitive polling; EC’s local projections can overstate insurgent seat wins when organization and incumbency effects aren’t fully captured. I lack confirmation that Reform has a near-full candidate slate across KCC—without that, a plurality becomes very hard. Also, in a split right, Labour/Lib Dem/Green can pick up urban/suburban divisions, making a Reform plurality less likely even if Reform’s vote share is high. Still, given the proximity to the election and at least one model explicitly pointing to a Reform plurality, I’m modestly raising my probability. I would move higher with evidence of full/slate coverage, multiple independent polls showing Reform leading in many divisions, or strong local by-election performance/ground operation reports; I would move lower with evidence of incomplete slates, tactical anti-Reform coordination, or credible local polling showing Con/Lab ahead in key areas.",
