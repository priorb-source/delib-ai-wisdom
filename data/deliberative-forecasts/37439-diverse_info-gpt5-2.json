    "review": "Both forecasters add useful, largely consistent signals. New to me from F2: (1) a second 2025 call on March 18, which marginally raises the plausibility of another call; (2) an April 4 Kremlin line that no calls were planned in the “near future,” which tilts downward in this specific window. F3’s point about Trump floating a possible mid-May meeting and Peskov’s denial of a Putin Middle East trip mostly bears on in-person contact; for phone calls, travel schedules are less binding, but the absence of coordinated travel planning does suggest engagement is not front-loaded for mid-May. Both emphasize the narrow 34-day window, the default of no call, and the extra hurdle that both sides must acknowledge the call—points I agree with. Net, their arguments nudge in opposite directions and largely offset, reinforcing my prior rather than shifting it.",
    "rationale": "Time window: May 12–June 15 (~34 days). The base rate for leader-to-leader calls is episodic, not routine, so status quo is No. Upside factors: two recent calls (Feb and reportedly Mar 18) confirm open channels; Kremlin talk (May 5) of a meeting being “necessary” keeps high-level contact on the agenda; Ukraine or other crises could prompt a rapid call; Trump is dispositionally comfortable with direct leader outreach. Downside factors: The Kremlin’s April 4 guidance of no calls in the “near future” still applies as we approach the window; Peskov’s emphasis on “adequate preparation” implies staff-led groundwork first, making a principal call within weeks less certain; no credible reporting points to an imminent leader call; and the mutual-acknowledgment requirement adds tail risk even if contact occurs. The new inputs from the other forecasters balance out—an extra prior call lifts odds slightly, the April 4 signal lowers them—leaving my overall assessment unchanged. I’d move up on credible reporting that a summit or substantive negotiation is being queued up (or explicit hints they’ll “speak soon”), or a sharp crisis escalation. I’d move down on explicit statements pushing any leader contact to later summer or if we enter June without preparatory signals.",
