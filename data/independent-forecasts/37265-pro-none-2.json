    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, the travel advisory for Tanzania remains at its current 'Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution'.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security and health situation in Tanzania continues along its current trajectory. Crime and terrorism risks do not escalate in a way that targets US citizens or prompts a policy change from the State Department. The current Level 2 advisory is deemed sufficient for the existing risks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant negative event occurs that elevates the risk profile of the country. This could include a large-scale terrorist attack in a major city or tourist area (like Arusha or Zanzibar), a sharp and sustained increase in violent crime against foreigners, or significant political instability and civil unrest that threatens the safety of travelers.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong tendency for bureaucratic inertia and the short time frame remaining before the question resolves. The US State Department's travel advisories do not change frequently without a compelling catalyst. As of May 2, 2025, Tanzania is at 'Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution,' a level it has maintained for a considerable time, indicating a stable assessment of the risks which include crime and terrorism. For the advisory to be elevated to Level 3, there would need to be a material deterioration in the security situation. While the provided article highlights existing threats from crime and terrorism, these are already factored into the current Level 2 rating. With less than two months until the resolution date, the probability of a triggering event of sufficient magnitude to cause a policy change is low, but not zero. My probability is not lower because the risks, particularly terrorism spilling over from neighboring regions or organized violent crime, are real and can manifest unpredictably. A single major incident could be enough to trigger an upgrade. My probability is not higher because this would imply a significant negative event is likely within the next eight weeks, and there is no public information to suggest such a specific and imminent threat. I would raise my forecast upon news of a major attack, a series of violent crimes targeting foreigners, or the emergence of widespread political violence. I would lower it as the deadline approaches without any such incidents.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Tanzania receive a \"Level 3 – Reconsider Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Travel Advisory for Tanzania: How Increased Crime and Terrorism Threats Impact Tourists in Popular African Destinations](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/travel-advisory-for-tanzania-how-increased-crime-and-terrorism-threats-impact-tourists-in-popular-african-destinations/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Tanzania has received a Level 3 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Tanzania.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
