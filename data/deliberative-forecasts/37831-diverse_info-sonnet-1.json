    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 raised several important points I hadn't fully considered. Most significantly, Forecaster 2 identified that actual legal challenges and Supreme Court appeals have been filed, creating a concrete (if unlikely) pathway to reversal. They also correctly emphasized that the resolution requires a government announcement of reversal, not merely a court ruling - meaning judicial compliance is uncertain even if courts ruled against the decree. Forecaster 3 added valuable context about the legitimization process through the transitional council vote and national consultations, which makes this more than just an arbitrary decree and thus harder to reverse. Both forecasters identified existing domestic opposition signals (protests of hundreds, intellectual dissent, arrests) that I had not incorporated. However, I note that both forecasters acknowledge these opposition signals are relatively weak - hundreds at protests is not regime-threatening scale. Their reasoning on the compressed 40-day timeline, low responsiveness to international pressure, and typical military junta behavior aligns with my analysis. Forecaster 2's higher 10% forecast seems optimistic given the extraordinarily short timeframe and the weak signals of opposition. Forecaster 3's 5% is very close to my 4% and reflects similar reasoning about the high inertia of authoritarian decisions.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating slightly upward from 4% to 6%. The new information about active legal challenges and existing domestic opposition creates marginally more pathways to reversal than I initially assessed. However, these pathways remain extremely unlikely to succeed within 40 days for several reasons: (1) The compressed timeline remains the dominant factor - authoritarian governments rarely reverse major political decisions within weeks; (2) Judicial independence in Mali is weak, making successful legal challenges improbable; (3) Even if courts ruled against the decree, government compliance is uncertain; (4) The protests mentioned (hundreds) are too small to threaten the regime; (5) The institutional legitimization through the transitional council makes reversal more difficult; (6) No evidence exists of regime reconsideration or wavering. The slight upward adjustment acknowledges that actual legal proceedings and some opposition activity create non-zero pathways I may have slightly underweighted. However, 6% still reflects extremely low probability given the combination of very short timeframe, entrenched military rule, and insufficient pressure (domestic or international) to force rapid reversal.",
