  "information": "Following the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, a constitutional deadline was triggered, requiring the formation of a new government to avoid a mandatory snap election. According to multiple wire-service reports from March and April 2025, a new government successfully won a confidence vote in the Serbian parliament in mid-April. This event removed the automatic, constitutionally-mandated trigger for snap elections before the summer.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately six and a half weeks, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The newly formed government will remain in place without calling for a new general election in the immediate future.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The new government, having secured a vote of confidence in mid-April 2025, focuses on establishing its agenda and governing. No significant political crisis emerges to destabilize the ruling coalition, and the government operates without the need for a new mandate. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an election announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the recent confidence vote, a severe internal crisis fractures the new ruling coalition, or a major public scandal erupts, making the government's position untenable. Faced with political paralysis or a loss of public trust, the Prime Minister calls a snap general election before July 1 to seek a new mandate and resolve the deadlock.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the information that a new government successfully won a confidence vote in mid-April 2025. This event is critical as it resolved the constitutional crisis triggered by the prime minister's earlier resignation and removed the automatic requirement for a snap election. A new status quo has been established where the government's immediate priority will be to govern, not to enter another costly and uncertain election cycle. With only six and a half weeks until the deadline, political inertia strongly favors the 'No' outcome.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 10% because Serbian politics can be volatile. An unexpected event, such as a major coalition rift or a strategic calculation by the ruling party to capitalize on a perceived moment of strength, could still trigger a snap election call. This accounts for the tail risk of sudden instability.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 10% because the primary driver for an election in the near term has been explicitly removed. For an announcement to happen before July 1, a new and significant crisis would have to emerge and be acted upon very quickly, which is a high bar so soon after the government's formation.\n\nI would increase my probability if credible reports emerge of a major split within the ruling coalition or if key political leaders begin publicly speculating about a new election. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if the new government successfully passes significant legislation or makes key appointments, signaling stability and an intent to govern for a longer term.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Serbia announce a general election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Serbia could face snap elections as PM’s resignation confirmed](https://tvpworld.com/85681783/serbia-could-face-snap-elections-as-pms-resignation-confirmed-)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a general election will be held is officially announced by the government of Serbia or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, a constitutional deadline was triggered, requiring the formation of a new government to avoid a mandatory snap election. According to multiple wire-service reports from March and April 2025, a new government successfully won a confidence vote in the Serbian parliament in mid-April. This event removed the automatic, constitutionally-mandated trigger for snap elections before the summer.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
