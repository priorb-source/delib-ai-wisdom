    "review": "The other forecasters provide a valuable spectrum of views, with forecasts ranging from 35% to 85%. The core disagreement centers on how to weigh recent, specific diplomatic momentum against the powerful inertial forces of the status quo and external political pressure. Forecaster 3 correctly identifies the significant hurdles, such as US/Israeli opposition and the short one-month timeframe, which often delay such major decisions. Their analysis serves as a crucial check against overconfidence. However, Forecaster 2 introduces a pivotal piece of new evidence that I had not considered: 'specific intelligence from Axios suggests Malta is preparing an announcement for June 20.' This is a highly significant and concrete data point. Forecaster 2's reasoning, which centers on this specific plan and the political cost of failure for the initiative's backers (like France), is highly compelling and makes a 'Yes' outcome seem more probable than my initial assessment.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast upward from 70% to 85%. The primary reason for this significant increase is the new information, raised by Forecaster 2, regarding a specific plan for Malta to announce recognition on June 20. My initial forecast was based on the strong general momentum and the action-forcing nature of the UN conference. That analysis made it likely that *some* country would act. The intelligence about Malta transforms this from a general probability into a specific, testable event. This aligns perfectly with Malta's previously stated position of waiting for the 'right circumstances.' A major UN conference focused on this very topic is the definition of the 'right circumstances.' While I respect the points raised by Forecaster 3 about the power of inertia and US/Israeli pressure, the recent recognitions by Spain, Ireland, and Norway in May 2025 demonstrate a new willingness among European nations to act despite such pressure. Therefore, while the risk of a last-minute delay or cancellation prevents a forecast above 90%, the combination of the broad, public diplomatic push and a specific, credible plan from at least one country makes the probability of a 'Yes' resolution very high.",
