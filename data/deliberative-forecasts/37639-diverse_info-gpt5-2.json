    "review": "- Forecaster 2 adds a key data point I hadn’t incorporated: a TRO reportedly extended on May 11 with the judge finding Khalil’s claims “plausible.” If accurate, that materially lowers short‑term removal risk because it both signals judicial skepticism and imposes a practical bar while the court considers further relief. Their timing logic (sub‑7 weeks left) is strong; the only caveat is TROs are typically short and can be dissolved, so they don’t guarantee protection through July 1. Still, the presence of a TRO meaningfully reduces the probability.\n- Forecaster 3 emphasizes executive pressure and political will. That’s relevant, but their analysis underweights procedural constraints: a pending BIA appeal generally prevents execution of removal until a BIA decision issues. Without evidence of an expedited BIA schedule or imminent affirmance, a 40% probability seems too high. Political pressure cannot override the need for a final order plus the likely need to overcome any federal-court stay. They also don’t engage with the short timeline and typical BIA/court pacing.\n- Net: F2’s new information pushes me lower; F3’s argument doesn’t overcome the legal/temporal hurdles.",
    "rationale": "Key constraints remain: (1) The BIA appeal likely prevents a final, executable removal order before the BIA rules; typical BIA timelines are measured in months, and even expedited paths rarely conclude within a few weeks. (2) A reported TRO as of May 11 suggests an active federal‑court barrier and judicial receptivity to Khalil’s claims, increasing the odds of continued protection (via extended TRO, a preliminary injunction, or subsequent appellate stays). (3) Even after a final order and absent court stays, removal logistics—especially if travel documents or receiving‑country acceptance are nontrivial—can add delay.\nPath to Yes exists but has multiple gates on a tight clock: the BIA would need to issue a decision by mid‑June, the district court would need to deny further injunctive relief (and no higher‑court stay would issue), and ICE would need travel docs and transport lined up for late June. That’s possible but not the base case.\nGiven the newly surfaced TRO detail and the short timeline, I’m revising down modestly from 15% to 10%.",
