    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Uncertain - the question assumes Mark Carney is Canadian Prime Minister, which requires verification. Without current approval data for either leader, the status quo is indeterminate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Mark Carney is not actually serving as Canadian Prime Minister on July 1, 2025, making the condition unsatisfiable and resolving as No. Alternatively, if Carney is PM but Trump maintains an approval rating equal to or higher than Carney's (possibly due to Trump's second-term honeymoon period extending through June 2025).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mark Carney is serving as Canadian Prime Minister and benefits from a new leader honeymoon effect with strong initial approval ratings (potentially 50-60%), while Trump's approval remains in his historically lower range (typically 35-45%). Carney consolidates Liberal support and projects competence during his early months.",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces significant informational uncertainty. The question presupposes Mark Carney is Canadian PM, but as of my last knowledge, Justin Trudeau held that position. If Carney became PM in early 2025, he would be in his early months by July 1st, typically a honeymoon period with elevated approval. New leaders often start with 10-15 percentage points higher approval than they'll maintain long-term. Trump's approval ratings have historically been polarized and relatively low (35-45% range in first term), though a second-term start might provide a temporary boost. Canadian PM approval ratings tend to track 5-10 points differently than US presidential ratings due to different political systems and cultural factors. Without the research assistant providing current May 2025 approval data for either leader, or confirmation of Carney's PM status, I'm forecasting with high uncertainty. The probability is not higher because: (1) uncertainty about Carney's actual PM status, (2) Trump might be experiencing his own honeymoon effect, (3) Morning Consult methodology might show different patterns than expected. The probability is not lower because: (1) if Carney is PM, new leader effects are real and substantial, (2) Trump's approval has historically been below-average. I would update upward with confirmation that Carney is PM and current polling showing him at 50%+ approval with Trump below 45%. I would update downward if Carney is not PM or current data shows Trump with unusually strong approval.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mark Carney has a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
