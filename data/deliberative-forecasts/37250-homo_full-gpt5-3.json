    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the two-veto-player dynamic (U.S. executive and El Salvador) and the tight timeline, which I agree are the core constraints. Forecaster 2 adds useful color on logistical lead time even after a deal is struck and explicitly clarifies that embassies/consulates don’t count as U.S. territory for resolution—both points slightly bearish. Forecaster 3’s framing that inertia dominates over ~60 days is persuasive and aligned with my baseline. Neither introduces decisive new evidence of movement on either veto player. The potential for court-driven coercion or a face-saving, last-minute compliance remains the main upside, but both correctly note that courts can’t compel El Salvador and that meaningful judicial penalties typically take time. Overall, their reasoning is consistent with mine; if anything, the logistical point nudges marginally downward, while the minimal-entry criterion (any physical entry counts) keeps a nontrivial tail.",
    "rationale": "My prior reasoning: two independent barriers must be cleared quickly—El Salvador must release/expel Garcia, and the U.S. executive must facilitate/permit entry. Current signals from both are negative: missed U.S. court deadline, public resistance from the administration, and Bukele’s hardened stance with Garcia in a max-security facility. Courts can escalate against the U.S. side, but that may not bite before July 1; they cannot compel El Salvador. Garcia’s custody rules out irregular entry. The unanimous Supreme Court ruling, congressional attention, and U.S. leverage over El Salvador keep a small path open for a late diplomatic or court-induced pivot. After weighing the other forecasters’ arguments, I see no new material evidence to raise the probability. The added points about logistics and embassy non-territoriality modestly reinforce the downside within the short window, but the minimal threshold for resolution (any brief physical entry) preserves a small but real upside tail if a deal suddenly materializes. Net: I keep a low single-digit probability, essentially unchanged from prior, as the situation appears static and time is short.",
