  "information": "Chegg Inc. received a non-compliance notice from the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) because its stock price fell below the minimum average closing price of $1.00 for 30 consecutive trading days, trading around $0.51-$0.65 as of early May 2025. The company has a six-month period to regain compliance, with potential measures including a reverse stock split. Chegg is scheduled to release its Q1 2025 financial results on May 12, 2025. Analyst predictions for the quarter include earnings of $0.01 per share and revenue of $114.77 million.\n\nCompetition from AI tools like ChatGPT has negatively impacted Chegg's core business model. In response, Chegg is introducing its own AI-powered features, such as 'Create' and 'Solution Scout'. In February 2025, the company filed a lawsuit against Google for unfair competition. Management is also undertaking a comprehensive strategic review, which includes considering privatization or acquisition as potential options. Furthermore, Chegg has initiated cost-cutting measures with the goal of achieving a 30% EBITDA margin and generating over $100 million in free cash flow by 2025.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, Chegg reported a 24% year-over-year decrease in revenue and a 23% drop in subscription sales. This marked the ninth consecutive quarter of revenue decline for the company. Chegg's financial metrics include a negative Altman Z-score of -3.31, an indicator of potential financial distress. Conversely, its Piotroski F-Score is 7, suggesting some aspects of its financial health remain robust. As of its last report, the company maintained a net-cash position of several hundred million dollars, reported positive free cash flow, and had no large debt maturities due before 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Chegg utilizes its significant cash reserves and positive free cash flow to continue operations through the July 1, 2025 deadline. The company continues its strategic review, pursues cost-cutting measures, and weathers the poor stock performance without needing to seek bankruptcy protection.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report reveals a catastrophic and previously undisclosed cash burn or liability, forcing management to file for bankruptcy protection to preserve remaining assets before a total collapse of liquidity.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on Chegg's immediate financial solvency, which makes a bankruptcy filing within the next two months highly improbable, despite the severe long-term challenges the business faces. The primary evidence supporting a 'No' resolution is the company's strong short-term financial position. As of the last report, Chegg had a net-cash position of several hundred million dollars, positive free cash flow, and crucially, no large debt maturities due before 2026. Companies with this level of liquidity and no immediate, major debt obligations do not typically file for bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a measure taken when a company cannot meet its financial obligations, which is not Chegg's current situation. While the intense competition from AI, nine consecutive quarters of revenue decline, a negative Altman Z-score, and an NYSE non-compliance notice all point to significant business distress, these are longer-term indicators. The timeline for this question is extremely short—less than two months. My probability is not lower than 3% because there is a non-zero chance that the upcoming Q1 2025 earnings report on May 12 could reveal a shocking deterioration of its financial position or a major undisclosed liability that accelerates a liquidity crisis. This is a low-probability, high-impact event. My probability is not higher because the available evidence strongly suggests Chegg has more than enough liquidity to operate well past the July 1, 2025 deadline. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see evidence of a rapid and severe cash burn in the upcoming quarterly report or news of a major creditor action. Conversely, a quarterly report confirming their stable cash position would lead me to lower my forecast.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Chegg file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWall Street Journal: [How ChatGPT Brought Down an Online Education Giant](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/how-chatgpt-brought-down-an-online-education-giant-200b4ff2)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Chegg, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
