    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds major new information I hadn’t incorporated: a unanimous Supreme Court ruling directing the government to “facilitate” Garcia’s return, district court oversight, and a missed April 7 deadline. That materially raises the theoretical feasibility and legal pressure. However, I find F2’s claim that El Salvador is “unlikely to be the principal blocker” unconvincing given Bukele’s public stance, the maximum-security detention, and his labeling Garcia a terrorist. Even with full U.S. cooperation, Salvadoran consent is required; courts cannot compel a foreign sovereign.\n\nForecaster 3 adds further signals of U.S. executive resistance: statements attributed to President Trump opposing return, DHS acknowledging an “administrative mistake” yet indicating Garcia would be deported again if he arrived, and the general ease of securing stays in high-profile immigration disputes. Those factors reinforce a low base rate within a two‑month window.\n\nNet: F2 rightly increases the plausibility via court pressure and logistics, but likely overweights U.S. capacity to effectuate return unilaterally. F3’s framing of dual resistance (U.S. and El Salvador) and short timeline feels closer to the mark. I update upward from my initial very low estimate due to the Supreme Court/district court posture, but still keep the forecast low due to the dual‑veto problem and evident U.S. reluctance.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~61 days. Status quo favors No: he remains in Salvadoran custody while U.S. executive resists practical steps. For a Yes, two things must happen quickly: (1) U.S. government must not only authorize return (e.g., parole, carrier letters, coordination) but stop delaying; and (2) El Salvador must release or expel him. The Supreme Court’s directive and active district court management increase the chance of (1) by creating legal jeopardy for noncompliance (contempt, sanctions). But the order’s “facilitate” language is weaker than a hard mandate to produce him by a date certain, and we already have one missed deadline—suggesting time‑consuming litigation, potential stays, and administrative slow‑roll. Meanwhile, (2) remains a hard constraint: Bukele’s public posture and high‑security detention imply high domestic political costs to releasing him on a short fuse absent a clear quid pro quo. Courts cannot compel El Salvador; only diplomacy can, and there’s no evidence of a high‑level bilateral deal in motion.\n\nUpside tails exist: a coercive court order without a stay plus visible DHS compliance; a diplomatic shift leading El Salvador to expel him to the U.S.; or a humanitarian/medical transfer. But each requires rapid movement against current signals. Downside signals—further slipping court timelines, appellate stays, or renewed Salvadoran hardline statements—would lock in No. Given the new judicial‑pressure information, I lift my estimate modestly but keep No as the strong modal outcome.\n\nWhat would move me up materially: a district court contempt order with near‑term compliance milestones and no stay; DHS issuing parole/transport docs; credible reports that El Salvador has approved or scheduled his departure. What would move me down: an appellate stay through/into July; Salvadoran legal steps cementing detention; continued lack of executive‑branch action by mid‑June.",
