  "information": "Circle Internet Group, Inc. has filed a public S-1 application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for an initial public offering (IPO), with plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol 'CRCL'. The initial confidential submission was in January 2024, with a public update on April 1, 2025. The lead underwriters include Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, and Deutsche Bank. This is Circle's second attempt to go public after a failed SPAC merger in 2021, which had valued the company at $9 billion. The current IPO valuation is estimated at $4 billion to $5 billion. As of mid-May 2025, the deal status is 'filed' but not yet 'active', with no road-show date or price range announced.\n\nCircle's main business is issuing the USDC stablecoin, which has a market capitalization of approximately $60 billion. The company's revenue is primarily generated from managing the reserve assets backing USDC, which produced $1.7 billion in income in 2024, accounting for 99.1% of total revenue. The company's financial performance has varied, reporting a net loss of $768.8 million in 2022 followed by a net income of $267.6 million in 2023. For 2024, Circle's revenue was $1.68 billion, while net income declined 42% to $155.7 million and adjusted EBITDA fell 29% to $285 million. A major expense in 2024 was $907.9 million paid to partner Coinbase for USDC distribution. The company's liquidity was $1.05 billion at the end of 2024.\n\nAccording to multiple reports in May 2025, Circle's IPO plans were paused or delayed due to market volatility, sometimes referred to as the 'Trump effect'. A May 12 article in Expansión specifically listed Circle among several companies putting IPO plans on hold. However, the market for fintech listings is not entirely closed, as exemplified by the IPO of eToro on May 13. The broader cryptocurrency sector saw venture capital funding double to $6 billion in Q1 2025 compared to the previous year, despite a drop in the number of deals. During the same quarter, the total market value of stablecoins increased by 12%. The regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S. remains under development.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 48 days, from May 14, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Circle will not be publicly traded by July 1, 2025. The company has filed its S-1 but has not progressed to an active offering stage, with no roadshow or pricing announced.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Circle continues to pause its IPO plans due to market volatility. The typical IPO process requires 2-3 months from active filing to listing, which is insufficient given the 48-day timeframe. The company decides to wait until the second half of 2025 or later for more favorable market conditions before proceeding with roadshows and pricing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Circle has been working behind the scenes more aggressively than public information suggests. Market conditions stabilize quickly, and Circle announces roadshow dates within days. The company completes an accelerated 2-week roadshow by early June, prices the offering, and lists on the NYSE by late June 2025, capitalizing on its strong fundamentals and established business model.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly suggests this will not happen by July 1. First, the timeline is extremely tight - with only 48 days remaining, even an accelerated IPO would be challenging. Most IPOs require 3-4 months from active filing to listing. Second, the most critical and recent information is from May 12, 2025 (just 2 days ago) reporting that Circle has paused or delayed its IPO plans due to market volatility. Third, as of mid-May, the deal status remains 'filed' rather than 'active,' with no roadshow date or price range announced, indicating the company is not in late-stage preparation.\n\nCircle's business fundamentals are strong - $1.68 billion in revenue, $60 billion USDC market cap, and major underwriters lined up. The eToro IPO on May 13 proves the market isn't completely closed. However, these positives are overshadowed by the concrete evidence of delay and insufficient time. The company already changed course once with its failed 2021 SPAC merger, showing willingness to wait for better conditions.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: (1) the May 12 pause report is the most recent information and carries significant weight, (2) 48 days is simply insufficient for the typical IPO process stages, and (3) the status quo (companies not rushing IPOs in volatile markets) should receive extra weight. My forecast is not lower (not near 0%) because: (1) technically an accelerated timeline is theoretically possible with major underwriters already engaged, (2) work could have progressed more than publicly known, and (3) black swan events or strategic pivots occasionally occur. I would update higher with immediate announcement of roadshow dates and price range. I would update lower with any official confirmation of postponement or continued silence through late May.",
