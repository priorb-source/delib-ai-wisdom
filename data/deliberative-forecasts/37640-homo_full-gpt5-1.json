    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my view on inertia, archiving/records obligations, and the resolution-source nuance that a redirect or static page still counts as UP. Forecaster 2 added a useful point about fiscal-year timing (pre–Sept 30), which modestly lowers odds of a hard cutover by July 1. Forecaster 3 highlighted operational signals to watch (DNS/NS changes, TLS expirations) that could presage decommission. I don’t see strong counterarguments; if anything, their perspectives slightly strengthen the case for Yes given the short horizon and typical federal IT pacing.",
    "rationale": "Core factors remain: (1) The site is currently up; (2) .gov decommissioning requires multi-step approvals and coordination with GSA/NARA, with common practice to maintain an accessible archive/notice rather than drop the domain; (3) Resolution only needs IsItDownRightNow to see the domain as reachable, so redirects/static pages still satisfy the criterion. New considerations from the deliberation: (a) July 1 falls well before fiscal-year end, making an abrupt shutdown less likely than a post–Sept 30 transition; (b) Monitoring for TLS or DNS changes is prudent, but absent concrete evidence of impending decommission or certificate lapse before July 1, these are low-probability risks within a ~7-week window. Residual downside risks: a symbolic, accelerated takedown directive, an ill-timed outage or misconfiguration when Metaculus checks, or an unexpected cert expiration/CDN issue. On balance, the additional fiscal-year pacing argument nudges me slightly higher. I increase my forecast from 89% to 90%.",
