  "information": "According to the US Census Bureau, the US trade deficit for goods reached a record $162 billion in March 2025, a 9.6% increase from February. This was driven by a surge in imports, which increased by $16.3 billion to $342.7 billion. This rise in imports was attributed to businesses stockpiling goods in anticipation of new tariffs. US exports of goods in March 2025 increased by $2.2 billion to $180.8 billion, a 1.2% increase from February and a 6.8% increase from March 2024.\n\nSweeping new tariffs were implemented by the US administration on April 2, 2025, which were followed by retaliatory measures from multiple countries. Subsequent shipping data showed that China-US bookings were down 45% year-over-year. Additionally, manufacturing PMI reports from the period indicated contracting activity in the sector.\n\nTotal US exports for February 2025 were reported at $278.5 billion. Historical data shows that between 79% and 93% of Aprils have seen a year-over-year gain in exports. The Atlanta Federal Reserve estimated that trade subtracted 3 percentage points from GDP in the first quarter of 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5–6 weeks, until the Census/BEA International Trade in Goods and Services release for April 2025 (likely early June 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — total exports continue their gradual upward trend and exceed April 2024’s $262.6B.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Retaliatory tariffs bite quickly, energy and aircraft exports slump, and a stronger dollar plus softer global demand drive a double‑digit drop in goods exports from March alongside flat services, pushing total exports below ~$262.6B.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Goods exports slip modestly or hold near March levels while services exports remain firm (travel, business services), leaving total exports comfortably above $262.6B despite tariff noise.",
    "rationale": "Threshold: The question resolves Yes if April 2025 total exports exceed $262.578B (the April 2024 level).\n\nLatest reads and context:\n- Research assistant: February 2025 total exports were $278.5B. March 2025 goods exports were $180.8B (+6.8% YoY). Tariffs went into effect April 2, with some foreign retaliation; China–US bookings reportedly down 45% YoY; manufacturing PMIs contracting; Atlanta Fed noted trade subtracted from Q1 GDP mainly via import surge.\n- Heuristic check: If March goods are ~$181B and services typically ~90–95B, March total would be roughly in the low-to-mid $270Bs. For April to fall below $262.6B, we would need either an unusually sharp drop in goods (e.g., >$10–15B MoM) and/or an atypical decline in services. Services tend to be steadier; large one‑month drops are uncommon absent a shock to travel or business services.\n- Historical baseline: 79–93% of Aprils historically show YoY export gains, implying a high base rate for a Yes.\n\nBalancing considerations:\n- Status quo favors Yes: Upward nominal trend, strong services, and March’s YoY gains in goods suggest April’s level likely remains above $262.6B even with some tariff-related friction. February at $278.5B provides a sizable cushion versus the threshold (~6%+).\n- New risks pull the probability down: The April timing of tariff imposition and early retaliatory steps raise the chance of an unusually large, rapid goods-export drop (energy volumes/prices, aircraft delivery timing, agricultural shipments, and supply-chain/booking disruptions). PMI contraction and a strong dollar could add drag. Monthly goods-export volatility of $5–10B is common; >$10B is less common but plausible under policy shock.\n\nWhy not higher: The policy shock is atypical and could produce a sharper-than-normal April goods-export decline; retaliation and delivery delays could magnify the move. Data revisions and the fact that the threshold is close enough that a single volatile category (e.g., industrial supplies, aircraft) could swing the outcome warrant caution.\n\nWhy not lower: The cushion versus the threshold is meaningful; services exports resilience and the March/February levels indicate April does not need to be strong—merely not exceptionally weak. The 45% YoY China‑US booking decline likely reflects China-to-US flows (imports), not US exports, so its direct relevance to US exports is limited.\n\nWhat would change my view:\n- Up: Evidence that April services exports were robust (travel/transport), strong petroleum and LNG export volumes/prices, and normal aircraft/ag shipments; limited or delayed retaliation.\n- Down: Confirmed immediate, broad retaliation targeting key US export categories; reports of sharply lower April energy/ag volumes, notable aircraft delivery postponements, a pronounced April dollar surge, or early data (port stats, weekly energy/grain exports) indicating a large goods-export drop.\n",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US exports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
