  "information": "Starlink can provide service to Somalia without an in-country gateway station due to its use of inter-satellite laser links, which can connect to ground stations in neighboring countries like Kenya or Ethiopia. A report by the Washington Post indicated that the U.S. government has been diplomatically promoting Starlink's expansion in various countries, including Somalia. Local challenges in Somalia include a fragile security environment, complex import logistics for user terminals, and difficulties with payment processing infrastructure. According to 2022 World Bank data, about 30% of Somalia's 18 million people have internet access.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - While Musk announced that Starlink received a license for Somalia, the service has not yet been listed as 'Available' on the Starlink Availability Map",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite having the license, Starlink does not complete all necessary steps to launch service and update their website by July 1st. Delays could stem from: finalizing payment processing infrastructure for Somalia, coordinating local distribution of terminals, addressing security concerns for operations, bureaucratic processes for importation of equipment, or simply prioritizing other market launches. Even with minimal infrastructure requirements, the company needs time to establish operational readiness.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "With the license already secured and no requirement for in-country gateway infrastructure, Starlink rapidly activates service for Somalia. Leveraging inter-satellite laser links and existing ground stations in Kenya or Ethiopia, they can provide coverage immediately. With U.S. government diplomatic support pushing the expansion, Starlink prioritizes the Somalia launch and updates their availability map to show 'Available' status within the next 6.5 weeks.",
    "rationale": "The key favorable factor is that the license has already been announced, clearing a major regulatory hurdle. Additionally, the technical requirements are minimal since Starlink can serve Somalia without building in-country infrastructure, using inter-satellite links to connect through neighboring countries' ground stations. U.S. government support adds momentum. However, significant uncertainty remains about the timeline from license to actual website availability listing. Historically, Starlink expansions often take months from license approval to service availability, involving setup of payment systems, distribution networks, and operational procedures. Somalia's challenging environment - fragile security, complex logistics, payment infrastructure issues - could slow deployment. The 6.5-week timeframe is tight but not impossible. Without knowing the exact date of the license announcement or current deployment status, I must account for substantial execution risk. My forecast is not higher because we lack visibility into Starlink's actual deployment timeline and preparedness, and 6.5 weeks is relatively short for completing all operational requirements. It's not lower because the license approval is confirmed, technical barriers are low, and the timeframe isn't impossibly short. I would update higher with evidence of active deployment preparations, pilot programs, or official launch date announcements. I would update lower with evidence of regulatory complications, delayed equipment shipments, or statements suggesting longer timelines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Somalia as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Musk announces Starlink license for Somalia](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Musk_announces_Starlink_license_for_Somalia_999.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Somalia listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nStarlink can provide service to Somalia without an in-country gateway station due to its use of inter-satellite laser links, which can connect to ground stations in neighboring countries like Kenya or Ethiopia.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
