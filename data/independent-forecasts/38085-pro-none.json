    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The most recent data from the USA Today article on April 28, 2025, indicates that 14 million Florida residents are already under drought conditions, which meets the threshold for a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The onset of Florida's wet season in June brings significant, widespread rainfall, particularly over populous areas. An early tropical system or a persistent pattern of heavy afternoon thunderstorms alleviates drought conditions enough to lower the number of affected residents below 14.0 million by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Florida's wet season has a delayed or weak start. Rainfall during June is insufficient to overcome the existing precipitation deficits across the state's population centers. The number of residents in drought remains at or above the 14.0 million threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored on the strong status quo. According to the provided information from one month ago, the condition for a 'Yes' outcome (14 million residents in drought) is already met. In forecasting, the present state is often the best predictor of the near future. However, the one-month forecast horizon extends into a period of significant climatological change for Florida: the start of the summer wet season and the Atlantic hurricane season, both of which officially begin in June. This introduces substantial uncertainty. A 'No' outcome is very plausible if the seasonal rains arrive on time and with enough intensity to reduce drought coverage in populated areas. Since the current number is exactly at the 14.0 million threshold, any modest improvement in conditions could flip the outcome to 'No'. Conversely, a 'Yes' outcome is supported by the inertia of drought conditions; it often takes sustained, above-average rainfall to reverse a significant drought, and a slow start to the wet season would ensure the threshold remains met. I am placing the probability slightly in favor of 'Yes' because the existing drought conditions are a known fact, while the timing and intensity of the relieving rains are a forecast. My forecast is not higher because of the high likelihood of significant rainfall in Florida during June, which could easily improve conditions just enough to fall below the threshold. My forecast is not lower because the status quo is a powerful anchor, and reversing drought conditions often requires more than a few weeks of rain. I would increase this probability if medium-range weather forecasts indicated a drier-than-average start to June for Florida. I would decrease it if forecasts showed a high probability of an early-season tropical system or a particularly wet pattern developing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
