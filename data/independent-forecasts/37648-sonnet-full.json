  "information": "Ali Shamkhani, an advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader, has stated that Iran is ready to accept a new nuclear agreement with the United States in exchange for the immediate lifting of all economic sanctions. According to Shamkhani, Iran would commit to never producing nuclear weapons, eliminate its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and limit uranium enrichment to civilian levels under international oversight. Iran is currently enriching uranium to 60%. In a separate proposal presented during talks in Oman, Iran suggested the creation of a permanent joint nuclear enrichment company with regional Arab countries and American investors. Under this plan, Iran would continue to enrich uranium to a low level for civilian use and export it to other Arab nations, subject to increased international monitoring. Iranian officials have stated that the complete dismantlement of its nuclear program is a 'red line' but they are willing to cooperate to maintain their right to develop a peaceful civilian program.\n\nThe U.S. administration has outlined 14 non-negotiable 'red lines' for any new nuclear deal with Iran. These conditions include the complete removal of all of Iran's enriched uranium, the dismantling of its centrifuges, and the absence of any 'sunset clauses' that would allow restrictions to expire. President Trump has stated he is open to a deal to make the region safer, but his administration has also recently imposed new sanctions on Iran. Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the introduction of new sanctions during negotiations 'unacceptable.' Vice President J.D. Vance has publicly stated that Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon is 'completely off the table.' The U.S. negotiating position emphasizes the need for a 'strong agreement' with robust verification measures.\n\nSince April 2025, the United States and Iran have engaged in multiple rounds of indirect negotiations, mediated by Oman. The talks have been held in Muscat, Oman, and Rome, Italy, with the most recent fourth round taking place in Muscat on May 11. A fifth round of negotiations has been agreed upon. Both sides have described the discussions with terms such as 'constructive,' 'productive,' and 'difficult but useful,' with an Iranian official stating that the parties' positions have 'converged' and 'progress has been made.' In parallel, Iran is also scheduled to hold talks with the 'Euratrium'—the UK, France, and Germany—in Istanbul. The negotiations are proceeding under a deadline reportedly set by President Trump in March, which gave Iran two months to reach an agreement.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No deal. The United States and Iran have had no nuclear agreement since the US withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018. The status quo is continued tensions, economic sanctions on Iran, and an absence of formal nuclear constraints beyond what Iran voluntarily maintains under IAEA monitoring.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The fundamental gap between the US's 14 non-negotiable 'red lines' (demanding complete removal of enriched uranium and dismantling of centrifuges) and Iran's 'red line' (refusing complete dismantlement of its nuclear program) proves insurmountable. The continuing imposition of new US sanctions during negotiations strains the talks. The fifth round of negotiations makes insufficient progress, and no agreement is reached by July 1. Domestic political pressures in both countries prevent the necessary compromises.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The positive momentum from recent negotiations accelerates in the fifth round of talks. Both sides find creative compromises: Iran agrees to eliminate its 60% enriched uranium, significantly reduce stockpiles, and accept enhanced monitoring in exchange for phased sanctions relief. The US reframes some 'red lines' or finds technical solutions that allow both sides to claim victory. Oman's mediation proves successful, and a framework agreement is announced in mid-to-late June 2025, just before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly suggests NO DEAL, as the US and Iran have been without a nuclear agreement since 2018, and major diplomatic breakthroughs are historically rare events. However, several factors create genuine possibility: four rounds of negotiations since April with consistently positive characterizations ('constructive,' 'productive,' 'positions have converged'), active mediation by Oman, reported Israeli intelligence suggesting high probability, and apparent urgency from Trump's March deadline. The key challenge is the fundamental incompatibility between stated positions. The US demands complete removal of enriched uranium and centrifuge dismantlement with no sunset clauses, while Iran explicitly calls complete dismantlement a 'red line.' The US continues imposing sanctions during talks, which Iran calls 'unacceptable,' suggesting continued tensions despite positive rhetoric. The timeframe of 1.5 months is extremely compressed for resolving such complex issues that typically require years. Historical precedent shows Iran has never agreed to complete dismantlement, and the Trump administration has a track record of maintaining hardline positions. The positive diplomatic language could represent genuine progress or mere diplomatic posturing to show good faith. While the ongoing negotiations and reported convergence prevent dismissing the possibility entirely, the combination of incompatible stated positions, very short timeframe, status quo inertia, and complexity of verification mechanisms makes a completed deal by July 1 unlikely though not impossible. I would update higher if either side publicly softens red lines, if a breakthrough is announced in the fifth round, or if draft agreement details leak. I would update lower if talks stall, more sanctions are imposed, or either side reiterates incompatible positions.",
