    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known when Berkshire Hathaway files its Q1 2025 13F, which is due by May 15, 2025. As today is May 8, 2025, the outcome will be known within approximately one week.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Berkshire Hathaway has held exactly 10,000,000 shares of Amazon since Q2 2019. If they make no changes to this position, the holding will not be greater than 10,000,000 shares, resulting in a 'No' resolution.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire's investment managers, likely Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, review the Amazon position during Q1 2025 and decide not to purchase additional shares. They may believe the stock is fully valued or that there are better opportunities elsewhere. As a result, the 13F filing shows a holding of 10,000,000 shares or less (if they decided to trim the position), causing the question to resolve as 'No'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "During Q1 2025, Berkshire's investment managers see a compelling reason to increase their stake in Amazon. This could be triggered by a temporary dip in Amazon's stock price or strengthened long-term conviction in the company's core businesses like AWS and advertising. They execute a purchase of any number of shares, bringing the total holding to a figure greater than 10,000,000 and causing a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "rationale": "The foundation of this forecast is the strong status quo. Berkshire Hathaway has maintained its Amazon stake at exactly 10,000,000 shares for over five years, since the second quarter of 2019. This long period of inaction suggests a high level of comfort with the current position size and a strong inertia against changing it. The base rate for Berkshire changing a long-held position in any given quarter is low. Since the status quo of no change results in a 'No' outcome, this is the most probable result. The research assistant's report indicated no new information, reinforcing reliance on this historical pattern. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 10% because the threshold for a 'Yes' is very small — a purchase of just one share would suffice. Berkshire has a significant cash pile to deploy, and adding to existing, successful positions is a common investment strategy. One of the investment managers, who originally initiated the position, could have easily seen a brief opportunity to add a small amount during the quarter. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because of the powerful counter-signal from the multi-year holding pattern. This pattern implies that the managers likely view the position as 'full' at its current size within the portfolio, especially given Amazon's strong stock performance which may have pushed its valuation beyond Berkshire's typical comfort zone for new purchases. To change this long-standing holding, there would likely need to be a significant change in valuation or business outlook. Without evidence of such a catalyst in Q1 2025, a purchase remains unlikely.\n\nI would increase my forecast if I learned that Amazon's stock had a significant, unjustified price drop during Q1 2025. I would decrease my forecast if public statements from Berkshire's leadership in early 2025 had indicated a bearish sentiment on large-cap technology valuations.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 10,000,000 shares of Amazon.com, Inc.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
