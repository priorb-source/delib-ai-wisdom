  "information": "A recent parliamentary by-election in Wellingborough, located within the West Northamptonshire council area, saw a swing from the Conservative Party to the Labour Party. The 2025 election will be contested on new electoral boundaries. Political analyst Professor Sir John Curtice has predicted that nationally, Reform UK could win hundreds of council seats in the May 2025 local elections.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. Local elections in England typically occur in early May, so the 2025 West Northamptonshire Council election is likely scheduled for May 1st or the first Thursday in May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservative Party currently likely controls the most seats on West Northamptonshire Council, given the area's traditional political leanings and the council's composition following its creation in 2021. The status quo would be Conservatives retaining the most seats after the 2025 election.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Labour or another party wins the most seats following a significant swing away from the Conservatives. This could be driven by poor national Conservative performance, strong local Labour organization building on the Wellingborough by-election momentum, and/or Reform UK splitting the Conservative vote sufficiently that Labour emerges with the largest number of seats even without winning a majority.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite national Conservative unpopularity, they retain the most seats through a combination of factors: opposition votes splitting between Labour, Liberal Democrats, Reform UK and independents; local Conservative incumbency advantages; traditional Conservative strength in parts of West Northamptonshire; and Reform UK underperforming predictions, thereby not significantly eroding the Conservative vote share.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly suggests Conservative weakness. The Wellingborough parliamentary by-election demonstrated a substantial swing to Labour in this very area. Nationally, the Conservatives have been polling poorly, and Professor Sir John Curtice predicts Reform UK could win hundreds of council seats, which would likely come substantially at Conservative expense. The new electoral boundaries add uncertainty but don't fundamentally alter the political dynamics. However, 'winning the most seats' only requires a plurality, not a majority. Even if Conservatives lose significant ground, they could still emerge with the most seats if the opposition vote fragments between Labour, Liberal Democrats, Reform UK, and independents. Local elections can sometimes deviate from national trends due to strong local campaigns or candidate effects. The forecast is not higher because all recent evidence points to Conservative decline, from national polling to the specific Wellingborough by-election result. The timing (just 2-3 weeks away) means trends are unlikely to reverse dramatically. The forecast is not lower because opposition fragmentation could still allow Conservatives to win a plurality despite losing vote share. We lack detailed seat-by-seat polling or current council composition data that would allow more precise estimation. For this forecast to move higher, I would need to see evidence of Conservative recovery in local polling, Labour organizational weakness, or Reform UK focusing efforts elsewhere. For it to move lower, I would need clearer evidence that Labour or another single party is positioned to definitively overtake the Conservatives in seat count.",
