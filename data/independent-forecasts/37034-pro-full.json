  "information": "According to Baker Hughes data from mid-April 2025, the total number of active drilling rigs in the U.S. rose by 2 to 585. This followed a 7-rig dip in the prior week. The count of oil rigs rose by 1 to 481, and gas rigs also increased by 1 to 98. The total rig count is down by 34 compared to the same period in the previous year. Drilling activity in the Permian basin was steady at 289 rigs, which is 29 fewer than the previous year. The Frac Spread Count, which estimates the number of crews completing wells, fell by 10 to 195.\n\nAs of late April 2025, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices were around $64-$65 per barrel, after the American Petroleum Institute reported a decrease of 4.565 million barrels in U.S. crude oil inventories for the week ending April 18. This price is near the breakeven point for many drilling operations, which is estimated to be around $65 per barrel. A Dallas Fed survey of 130 energy firms in Texas, New Mexico, and Louisiana indicated that firms are dealing with increased costs, reduced rig counts, and layoffs. The survey's company outlook index decreased by 12 points, while the outlook uncertainty index increased by 21 points, with executives citing tariffs on steel (25%) as increasing costs for casing and tubing.\n\nSeveral major energy and service companies reported on their performance in Q1 2025. Halliburton reported declining profits in North America due to decreased drilling activity. Baker Hughes' oilfield services division saw a 10% sequential drop in revenue. In contrast, Occidental Petroleum announced a capital expenditures plan of $7 billion to $7.2 billion for 2025, with $3.7 billion allocated to the Permian Basin. The company plans to operate 24 gross drilling rigs and bring 500 to 550 new wells online in the Permian during the year.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The most recent rig count is 585, which is not less than 583. If the rig count remains unchanged, the question will resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The number of active rigs remains at or above 583. This could happen if a modest increase in oil prices encourages producers to maintain or add a few rigs, or if drilling activity simply stagnates around the current level for the next five weeks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The number of active rigs drops by 3 or more from the current level of 585. This scenario would be driven by sustained WTI oil prices at or below the breakeven point of ~$65/bbl, which would disincentivize new drilling and lead some producers to drop rigs to cut costs.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards a 'Yes' outcome. The primary driver is the current economic environment for U.S. shale producers. As of late April 2025, WTI crude prices are hovering around $64-$65 per barrel, which is near the breakeven point for many operators. This provides little economic incentive to increase drilling activity. This is corroborated by several data points from my research. First, the Dallas Fed survey indicates rising costs, a negative industry outlook, and increased uncertainty, all of which typically precede a reduction in capital expenditure and drilling. Second, major oilfield service companies like Halliburton and Baker Hughes have reported declining revenues in North America, directly citing lower activity levels. This is a strong signal from the companies that physically enable drilling. Third, the long-term trend is a significant decline, with the rig count being 34 rigs lower than the same period last year. While the most recent weekly data showed a minor increase of 2 rigs to 585, this appears to be short-term noise within a broader trend of stagnation or decline. For the question to resolve 'Yes,' only a net decrease of 3 rigs is needed over a five-week period, which is a very small change given the prevailing headwinds. My probability is not higher because the current count of 585 is very close to the threshold. The rig count could easily remain flat or fluctuate slightly, resulting in a 'No' outcome. Oil prices are volatile and a geopolitical event could cause a price spike, reversing sentiment. My probability is not lower because the combination of low prices, rising costs, and negative industry sentiment creates significant downward pressure on drilling activity, making a small net decrease over five weeks more likely than not. I would increase my forecast if we see a consistent downward trend in the weekly reports leading up to May 30th or if oil prices drop further. I would decrease my forecast if oil prices rise sustainably above $70/bbl or if the rig count holds steady or increases over the next couple of weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive.
