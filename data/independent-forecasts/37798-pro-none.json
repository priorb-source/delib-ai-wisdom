    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "27 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The provided article indicates the Dodgers are winning consistently despite challenges, suggesting they are currently at or near the top of the league standings. Given the short timeframe, the status quo is that they will maintain this position.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Another elite team, such as the Philadelphia Phillies, Atlanta Braves, or New York Yankees, goes on an exceptional winning streak over the next 27 days. Simultaneously, the Dodgers' performance dips slightly due to their existing injuries or a normal period of regression, causing them to be overtaken in the standings.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Dodgers' deep and talented roster continues to produce at a high level. They maintain a winning percentage well above their competitors through the next month, solidifying their position as the team with the best record in MLB by the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the short timeframe and the implied current state of the Dodgers' performance. The resolution date is only 27 days away. In baseball, while upsets happen daily, the standings change relatively slowly. The provided Yahoo Sports article, with its headline 'the wins keep coming', strongly suggests the Dodgers are currently the league's top team or very close to it. A team with their level of talent, featuring multiple MVP-caliber players like Mookie Betts, Shohei Ohtani, and Freddie Freeman, has a very high performance floor. It is difficult for even a great team to fall from the top of the league in less than a month.\n\nMy probability is not higher because of the inherent variance in baseball. A 27-day period covers approximately 25 games. A slump for the Dodgers combined with a hot streak for another contender (e.g., the Phillies, who also have a very strong roster) could easily flip the outcome. The article itself mentions injuries, which remain a persistent risk that could degrade performance.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the Dodgers' sheer talent and depth make them uniquely resilient to the typical slumps that affect other teams. They are built to endure a 162-game season, and a 27-day stretch is one they are statistically favored to navigate successfully while maintaining an elite record. For them to be overtaken, it would likely require another team to play near-perfect baseball, which is a low-probability event in itself.\n\nI would increase my forecast if one or two of the other top contenders suffer key injuries or enter a noticeable losing streak. I would decrease my forecast if the Dodgers suffer a new, major injury to one of their superstar players or if they lose a series to a team with a losing record, indicating a potential slump.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the LA Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nYahoo Sports: [Even as Dodgers navigate injuries and manage pitcher usage, the wins keep coming](https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/article/even-as-dodgers-navigate-injuries-and-manage-pitcher-usage-the-wins-keep-coming-053322413.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Los Angeles Dodgers have the highest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
