    "review": "The other two forecasters' analyses strongly align with my own, identifying the same key drivers and risks. We all agree that President Zelenskyy's explicit public confirmation, the host nation's active security preparations, his history of wartime travel, and the immense strategic importance of the summit are the primary factors pointing to a 'Yes' outcome. We also concur that the main risks are a sudden, major military escalation or a specific security threat. Forecaster 2's reasoning is nearly identical to my initial analysis. Forecaster 3 presents similar evidence but arrives at a slightly more conservative 92% probability. Interestingly, Forecaster 3 notes that the lack of a ready EU sanctions package could strengthen Zelenskyy's resolve to attend and lobby in person, an argument which, to me, supports a higher, not lower, probability. This small difference in forecasts appears to be a minor calibration disagreement on the weight of low-probability tail risks rather than a difference in fundamental analysis.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 95%. The consensus among all three forecasters on the core evidence reinforces my confidence in the initial assessment. No new evidence or compelling counterarguments were raised that would warrant a change. The primary factors remain overwhelmingly in favor of attendance: Zelenskyy has given his word, the host country is preparing for him, and the strategic necessity of his presence is undeniable. The risks, while real, are low-probability events for which there are currently no leading indicators. The 5% probability assigned to a 'No' outcome remains an appropriate hedge against the inherent volatility of leading a country at war, such as a sudden military crisis or a direct security threat materializing in the ~12 days before the summit begins. The slight difference between my 95% and Forecaster 3's 92% is not significant enough to warrant an update without a more specific argument for the increased risk.",
