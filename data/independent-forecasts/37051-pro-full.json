  "information": "The Trump administration has threatened to revoke Harvard University's 501(c)(3) status, citing the university's DEI programs, alleged anti-Semitism, and refusal to comply with demands for reforms to governance and leadership. The administration has frozen $2.2 billion in federal funding and $60 million in contracts intended for the university. In response, Harvard has filed a lawsuit against the administration, arguing that its actions are arbitrary, capricious, and outside the scope of its legal authority. The university has rejected the administration's demands, with its spokesperson stating there is 'no legal basis for revoking the University's exemption.'\n\nThe authority to revoke a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status rests with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), not the President. According to legal precedent, revocation typically requires evidence that an organization is violating public policy or engaging in illegal activities. The key Supreme Court case, Bob Jones University v. United States (1983), affirmed that tax-exempt status could be revoked for organizations violating clear public policy, such as racial discrimination. The legal and administrative process in the Bob Jones case took over seven years to resolve. Historically, no major university has had its tax-exempt status revoked in recent decades.\n\nLegal experts and former IRS officials state that the revocation process normally involves a multi-step, years-long procedure including an audit, formal notice, appeals, and litigation. Statutory safeguards, such as IRC § 7217 and a 1998 anti-targeting law, are intended to prevent direct presidential direction or politically motivated targeting. The IRS is also reportedly experiencing significant internal challenges, including leadership turnover with three acting directors in one week and workforce reductions. Despite these procedural hurdles, multiple news outlets have reported the Trump administration has formally asked the IRS to begin revocation proceedings and that the agency is 'making plans' to rescind Harvard’s exemption.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Slightly over two months, as the resolution date is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Harvard University retains its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The established, multi-step IRS process for revoking tax-exempt status, coupled with Harvard's legal challenges, does not conclude before the deadline. The July 1, 2025 date passes with Harvard's status intact, even if an investigation is still ongoing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration successfully exerts unprecedented political pressure on the IRS to bypass or drastically accelerate its normal procedures, leading to a formally announced and credibly reported revocation of Harvard's 501(c)(3) status before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant procedural, legal, and historical barriers to revoking a major university's tax-exempt status within such a short timeframe. The authority rests with the IRS, which follows a deliberate, multi-year process involving audits, appeals, and litigation, as established by precedent like *Bob Jones University v. United States*, which took over seven years. The deadline of July 1, 2025—just over two months away—is extremely tight for such a monumental action. Furthermore, legal safeguards exist to prevent politically motivated targeting, and Harvard has already initiated litigation that will create further delays. The historical base rate is also compelling; no major university has had its tax-exempt status revoked in recent history. The status quo is a powerful force, and bureaucratic inertia at the IRS, which is reportedly facing internal challenges, makes a rapid, unprecedented action highly improbable. My probability is not lower than 5% because the political will from the executive branch is explicit and intense. Reports that the administration has formally requested proceedings and the IRS is 'making plans' introduce a non-zero risk of a highly irregular, politically-driven outcome that defies normal procedure. My probability is not higher than 5% because the legal and procedural hurdles are immense and specifically designed to be slow and resistant to political pressure. For me to update my forecast towards 'Yes,' I would need to see credible evidence that the IRS has bypassed key procedural steps, such as a court ruling dismissing Harvard's initial legal challenges or the appointment of a new IRS commissioner with a mandate to act swiftly. To update towards 'No,' I would look for a court injunction halting IRS action or reporting that the agency has informed the White House that it must follow its standard, multi-year process.",
