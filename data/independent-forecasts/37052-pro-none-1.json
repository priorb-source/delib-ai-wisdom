    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The question closes on July 1, 2025. As of April 25, 2025, there are approximately two months remaining.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No successful coup occurs in any country in Africa or Latin America before the deadline. Existing governments remain in power or transfer power through constitutional means.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing instability, political tensions, and security challenges in several countries, particularly in the Sahel region of Africa, no group within the military or state apparatus successfully overthrows a government. There might be coup attempts, mutinies, or major protests, but they either fail or do not meet the resolution criteria for a successful coup d'état before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A military junta in a politically unstable West African nation, citing corruption and failure to combat an ongoing insurgency, detains the president, dissolves parliament, and seizes control of state media. Within days, the junta solidifies its control over the military and government apparatus with no significant internal resistance, leading credible media to report a successful coup.",
    "rationale": "This forecast balances two competing factors: the very short time frame and the high recent frequency of coups in the specified regions. The primary factor limiting the probability is the short, two-month window. Successful coups are relatively rare events on any given day, and it is more likely than not that such a specific event will not occur in this brief period.\n\nHowever, this is weighed against a strong base rate of successful coups since 2020, particularly in Africa's 'coup belt' (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Guinea, Gabon). The underlying drivers for this instability—weak governance, persistent jihadist insurgencies, economic hardship, and a permissive international environment—remain firmly in place. This suggests a systemic risk that cannot be ignored. The recent failed attempt in Bolivia (June 2024) and high instability in countries like Peru and Haiti demonstrate that Latin America also contributes a non-zero, albeit smaller, probability.\n\nMy probability of 20% is not higher because the two-month period is the dominant constraint; the status quo is generally resilient over short durations. A higher forecast would imply a coup is a near-term expectation rather than just a significant risk.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because ignoring the striking cluster of recent African coups would be to underweight the clear evidence of regional instability. A probability below 15% would treat these events as isolated incidents rather than a symptom of ongoing, unresolved crises that could easily boil over.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon news of a significant triggering event, such as a major military mutiny, a presidential assassination, or a rapidly escalating constitutional crisis in a historically vulnerable country. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast if a credible, high-profile coup plot is publicly thwarted, potentially deterring others in the short term.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to [Powell & Thyne (2011, p. 252)](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf), a coup is \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\" In recent years, some of the coups in Africa have been:&#x20;\n\n* [Mali August 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Mali May 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Niger March 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Nigerien_coup_attempt) (attempt)\n* [Niger July 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nigerien_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Gabon August 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Gabonese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Chad January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%27Djamena_attack) (possible attempt)\n* [Burkina Faso January 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Burkina Faso September 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)&#x20;\n* [Guinea September 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n\nLatin America has had the following coup attempts in recent years:\n\n* [Peru self-coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Peruvian_self-coup_attempt), December 2022\n* [Brazil Congress attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack), January 2023\n* [Bolivia coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bolivian_coup_attempt), June 2024\n\nSee also: [VoA by the numbers Coups in Africa](https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is a successful coup d’état in any country on the African continent or Latin America before July 1, 2025, according to credible media reports. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nLatin America is defined as any country in North America or South America whose primary language is Spanish, Portuguese or French.\n\nA coup d’état (often shortened to \"coup\") is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) as an event in which a state's military or other components of its power structure overthrow the existing political authority.&#x20;\n\nA \"successful\" coup is defined as a coup in which the group or person attempting to seize power establishes control over both the government and military, and will be considered to have succeeded once any significant resistance to their authority has ceased.&#x20;\n\nA self-coup, [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup) as a political leader, having come to power through legal means, remaining in power through illegal means, will count. This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
