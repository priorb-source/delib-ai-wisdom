  "information": "A state of emergency was declared in Samoa on March 31, 2025, due to a severe energy crisis. The declaration was scheduled to be in effect for 30 days, from April 1, 2025, through April 29, 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the currently-declared state of emergency is scheduled to lapse on April 29, 2025, leaving no SOE in effect on April 30 unless it is extended or a new one is declared.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The government allows the March 31 SOE to expire on April 29 without renewal, possibly citing improved fuel supply/power stability or the adequacy of ordinary legal powers to manage remaining rationing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The government extends the existing SOE before it expires (e.g., for another 14–30 days), or issues a fresh SOE covering April 30 due to continuing power shortages and the need for emergency powers.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: Per the research assistant, Samoa declared a state of emergency on March 31, 2025, for the energy crisis, scheduled to run April 1–29. That means that, absent further action, there would be no SOE in effect on April 30.\n- Status quo weight: Because the world usually changes slowly and the current instrument has an explicit end date prior to April 30, the baseline is No. To get to Yes, the government must actively extend or re-declare.\n- Factors raising the chance of an extension: The crisis appears serious (nationwide power cuts), and Samoa has precedent of extending SOEs when underlying conditions persist (e.g., COVID-era practice). If blackouts/fuel financing issues remain unresolved near month-end, Cabinet has a clear mechanism to extend, likely covering April 30.\n- Factors lowering the chance of an extension: Governments often prefer to end SOEs promptly for political/constitutional reasons if ordinary powers suffice. If fuel supply is restored (e.g., via emergency procurement or external assistance) and rationing can be managed under existing statutes, they may let the SOE lapse on April 29.\n- Net assessment: With 9 days to go, the default is No, but the probability of at least a short extension that includes April 30 is material given the severity and the short timeline to resolve structural issues. I put more weight on the scheduled expiry but allow a substantial tail for continuation.\n- Why not higher: We have a specific scheduled end (Apr 29) and no current evidence of an announced extension; governments often pivot away from SOEs once immediate measures are in place.\n- Why not lower: The underlying issue (national power cuts) could easily persist past April 29, and Samoa has a track record of extending SOEs for ongoing crises; extending by another period that covers April 30 would be administratively straightforward.\n- What would move me up: Reports from Samoa Observer, RNZ Pacific, or official Samoa Government channels indicating ongoing severe outages, fuel shortages, or Cabinet/Head of State intent to extend; failure to secure financing for fuel; continued rationing measures that explicitly rely on emergency powers.\n- What would move me down: Official statements that the crisis is stabilized; announcements of secured fuel supply and restored generation; guidance that any remaining measures will proceed under normal legal authorities; explicit notice that the SOE will not be renewed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count. (Note that when it was declared, it was scheduled to be in effect through April 29, 2025.)\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA state of emergency was declared in Samoa on March 31, 2025, due to a severe energy crisis. The declaration was scheduled to be in effect for 30 days, from April 1, 2025, through April 29, 2025.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
