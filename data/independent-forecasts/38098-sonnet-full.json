  "information": "Incumbent Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, in office since 2003, has commenced his 2026 re-election campaign. He has secured endorsements from prominent party figures, including former President Donald Trump, Governor Henry McMaster, and Senator Tim Scott. On the Democratic side, Dr. Annie Andrews, a pediatrician who ran for a House seat in 2022, announced on May 29, 2025, that she would be a candidate in the 2026 Senate race.\n\nAccording to news reports from February and March 2025, U.S. Representative Ralph Norman is \"seriously considering\" a run for Governor of South Carolina in 2026, when the incumbent will be term-limited. Several outlets, including The State, Roll Call, and Politico, have noted that Norman's office has denied any plans for a Senate run. Norman has officially filed for his own House re-election.\n\nAs of late May 2025, there was no publicly available evidence of preparatory activities for a Senate campaign by Ralph Norman. Reports indicated an absence of actions typically preceding a major campaign launch, such as filings with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) for a statement of candidacy, the formation of an exploratory committee, significant staff hires, or major donor activity. The official filing period for the 2026 South Carolina primary does not open until the spring of 2026.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 32 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ralph Norman does not declare candidacy for the US Senate race before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ralph Norman continues on his current path, maintaining his focus on either his House re-election bid (for which he has already filed) or his seriously considered run for Governor of South Carolina. He makes no announcement regarding Senate candidacy through the June 30, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite recent denials and his current trajectory, Norman makes a strategic pivot and announces a primary challenge to Senator Lindsey Graham before July 1, 2025. This would represent a significant departure from his publicly stated intentions and current campaign activities.",
    "rationale": "The evidence overwhelmingly favors a No outcome. Multiple credible sources from February and March 2025 report that Norman's office has explicitly denied plans for a Senate run. Norman has officially filed for House re-election and is 'seriously considering' a gubernatorial run instead. Most critically, there is a complete absence of preparatory activities typical of a major Senate campaign launch: no FEC filings for statement of candidacy, no exploratory committee, no significant staff hires, and no major donor activity. With only 32 days remaining until the resolution date, the probability of a dramatic reversal is very low. The status quo strongly favors continuation of his current path. While politicians can pivot unexpectedly, such changes typically show early warning signs through exploratory activities or staff movements - none of which are present here. The September 2023 Axios speculation about Norman challenging Graham appears to have been overtaken by his more recent focus on the gubernatorial race. For this forecast to be higher, I would need evidence of campaign infrastructure being built, donor outreach, or walking back his gubernatorial interest. For it to be lower, I would need a formal gubernatorial announcement or even stronger Senate denials. The small probability I assign (3%) accounts only for the theoretical possibility of an unexpected last-minute announcement, which would be highly unusual given the absence of groundwork.",
