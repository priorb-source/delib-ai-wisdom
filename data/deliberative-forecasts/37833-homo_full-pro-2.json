    "review": "Forecaster 2’s analysis closely mirrors my own, reinforcing the key arguments against a 'Yes' outcome: Trump's absence from X, Musk's deliberate pivot away from political content, and their current policy priorities lying elsewhere. Their reasoning is sound and aligns with the evidence provided. The minor difference in our forecasts (2% vs. 3%) is negligible and reflects a similar assessment of a very low probability event. Forecaster 3's analysis, however, is critically flawed. They base their entire forecast on the incorrect premise that the deadline was April 1, 2025, a date mentioned in the question title but superseded by the July 1, 2025 date in the binding resolution criteria. This misunderstanding invalidates their core argument that the event has already concluded. While their secondary points about platform usage and priorities are valid, they are the same points raised by myself and Forecaster 2. Therefore, their analysis does not provide a reliable basis for updating my forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I will not be changing my initial probability. Forecaster 2 provided a strong confirmation of my own reasoning, validating the core pillars of the argument for a 'No' outcome. There is a clear consensus that the current behaviors and stated priorities of both Donald Trump and Elon Musk make the specific outcome highly unlikely within the short remaining timeframe of approximately five weeks. Trump is not active on X, and Musk is actively reducing his political commentary on the platform. Furthermore, their attention is on other immigration policies, not the Diversity Visa. The reasoning provided by Forecaster 3 was discounted due to a fundamental error in identifying the correct resolution date. No new information or compelling alternative arguments were presented that would justify an update. The primary driver for a 'Yes' outcome remains a low-probability, unpredictable news event that is significant enough to divert their attention and provoke a public comment on X using the exact required phrase. My initial 2% forecast continues to reflect this small but non-zero possibility.",
