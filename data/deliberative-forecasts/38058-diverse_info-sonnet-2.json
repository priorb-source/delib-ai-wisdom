    "review": "Forecaster 3 presents the most sophisticated analytical framework by explicitly modeling the compound probability over multiple days. Their key insight—that achieving NO requires the word appearing on at least one paper every single day for 35+ days—is mathematically sound and shifts the burden of proof. However, Forecaster 2 provides crucial new information I lacked: the EU tariff deadline of July 9, which creates a 'ticking clock' throughout the entire resolution period. This significantly strengthens the case for sustained coverage.\n\nForecaster 2's observation about WSJ's 'What's News' section is particularly important given the resolution criteria allow the word to appear anywhere on the front page. This creates a consistent venue for brief mentions even on days when tariffs aren't the lead story.\n\nThe evidence that no qualifying day has occurred yet in the resolution window (late May) is telling. If tariffs were merely 'one of many' stories, we'd expect at least one clean day by now. This suggests the current salience is higher than a neutral baseline.\n\nForecaster 3's ~3% per-day omission probability seems too optimistic given: (1) the July 9 deadline ensuring sustained newsworthiness, (2) the broad definition capturing even passing mentions, and (3) current evidence showing persistent coverage. A per-day probability closer to 1-1.5% seems more defensible, yielding an overall probability around 30-40%.",
    "rationale": "I'm updating upward from 30% to 38% based on the deliberation. Forecaster 3's compound probability framework is compelling—I had underweighted how even small daily probabilities accumulate over 35+ days. The question requires just ONE qualifying day, not sustained absence.\n\nHowever, Forecaster 2's July 9 EU deadline information is critical and wasn't in my original analysis. This deadline falls just after the resolution period ends, creating maximum newsworthiness precisely during our window. Combined with the evidence that no qualifying day has occurred yet despite us being a week into the resolution period, this suggests sustained front-page presence.\n\nThe resolution criteria are broad—the word can appear in summary sections, not just headlines. WSJ's 'What's News' section is a particular concern for achieving a clean day. For both papers to simultaneously omit requires either: (1) a massive breaking news story displacing all tariff coverage, or (2) both editorial teams independently choosing alternative framings on the same day.\n\nMy updated probability reflects: accepting Forecaster 3's superior mathematical framework while incorporating Forecaster 2's deadline information to adjust downward the per-day omission probability from ~3% to ~1-1.5%. This yields an overall forecast in the 35-40% range.",
