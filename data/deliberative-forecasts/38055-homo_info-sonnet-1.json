    "review": "Both forecasters provided crucial new information that changes my assessment. Forecaster 2 revealed that Pyfer has strong recent momentum (6-1 in last 7 fights, 4-1 UFC record, recent Performance of the Night KO), which is significantly better than I assumed. However, they also noted that Pyfer previously withdrew due to illness, which substantially increases cancellation risk - fighters who withdraw once are more prone to recurring issues. Forecaster 3 provided important context on Gastelum: 24 UFC appearances and TUF 17 winner, though his 2-1 recent record suggests he's competitive but not dominant. The striking convergence around 45% across all three forecasts suggests we're capturing the key uncertainties reasonably well. The most significant update for me is the heightened cancellation risk due to Pyfer's previous withdrawal, which I underweighted initially.",
    "rationale": "I'm revising my forecast down from 48% to 45%. Here's my updated reasoning: (1) CANCELLATION RISK IS HIGHER: Pyfer's previous illness-related withdrawal is more concerning than a simple schedule change. This increases non-materialization risk from my initial 13-15% to approximately 20-25%, bringing fight-happens probability to ~75-78%. (2) PYFER'S WIN PROBABILITY IS HIGHER: His 6-1 recent record and 4-1 UFC record with a recent knockout demonstrates he's a legitimate contender, not just a 50-50 fighter. If the fight happens, I now assess his chances at 56-58%, up from my initial 50-53%. (3) COMBINED CALCULATION: 0.77 × 0.57 ≈ 44%, which I'll round to 45% for alignment with the evidence. The key insight is that these two factors roughly offset: increased cancellation risk pulls down, improved assessment of Pyfer's skill pulls up, yielding a net decrease of 3 percentage points. The convergence at 45% across all three forecasters reinforces confidence in this range.",
