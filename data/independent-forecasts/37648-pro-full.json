  "information": "Ali Shamkhani, an advisor to Iran's Supreme Leader, has stated that Iran is ready to accept a new nuclear agreement with the United States in exchange for the immediate lifting of all economic sanctions. According to Shamkhani, Iran would commit to never producing nuclear weapons, eliminate its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, and limit uranium enrichment to civilian levels under international oversight. Iran is currently enriching uranium to 60%. In a separate proposal presented during talks in Oman, Iran suggested the creation of a permanent joint nuclear enrichment company with regional Arab countries and American investors. Under this plan, Iran would continue to enrich uranium to a low level for civilian use and export it to other Arab nations, subject to increased international monitoring. Iranian officials have stated that the complete dismantlement of its nuclear program is a 'red line' but they are willing to cooperate to maintain their right to develop a peaceful civilian program.\n\nThe U.S. administration has outlined 14 non-negotiable 'red lines' for any new nuclear deal with Iran. These conditions include the complete removal of all of Iran's enriched uranium, the dismantling of its centrifuges, and the absence of any 'sunset clauses' that would allow restrictions to expire. President Trump has stated he is open to a deal to make the region safer, but his administration has also recently imposed new sanctions on Iran. Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the introduction of new sanctions during negotiations 'unacceptable.' Vice President J.D. Vance has publicly stated that Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon is 'completely off the table.' The U.S. negotiating position emphasizes the need for a 'strong agreement' with robust verification measures.\n\nSince April 2025, the United States and Iran have engaged in multiple rounds of indirect negotiations, mediated by Oman. The talks have been held in Muscat, Oman, and Rome, Italy, with the most recent fourth round taking place in Muscat on May 11. A fifth round of negotiations has been agreed upon. Both sides have described the discussions with terms such as 'constructive,' 'productive,' and 'difficult but useful,' with an Iranian official stating that the parties' positions have 'converged' and 'progress has been made.' In parallel, Iran is also scheduled to hold talks with the 'Euratrium'—the UK, France, and Germany—in Istanbul. The negotiations are proceeding under a deadline reportedly set by President Trump in March, which gave Iran two months to reach an agreement.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (47 days)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new nuclear deal is announced. The United States continues its sanctions regime against Iran, and Iran continues to enrich uranium to high levels without the constraints of a formal agreement, maintaining regional tensions.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations break down due to the inability to bridge the fundamental gap between the US demand for complete dismantlement and Iran's insistence on maintaining a civilian enrichment program. The imposition of new US sanctions derails the talks, or domestic political opposition in either country scuttles a potential compromise.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Facing a looming deadline and motivated by mutual interests in de-escalation and economic relief, both sides make significant compromises on their stated 'red lines.' The US agrees to a phased sanctions relief in exchange for Iran verifiably eliminating its 60% enriched uranium stockpile, capping future enrichment, and accepting intrusive international inspections. An announcement is made following a final round of talks in Muscat or another neutral venue.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant momentum in the ongoing negotiations, balanced against the substantial and publicly stated differences in each side's core demands. The primary driver for a higher probability is the frequency and intensity of the talks; four rounds since April with a fifth planned, characterized by both sides as 'constructive' and with reports of 'convergence.' The existence of a reported two-month deadline set in March by President Trump creates immense pressure to conclude a deal shortly. Furthermore, the report from Israeli media, citing that senior ministers believe a deal is highly probable, is a strong external indicator from a party with deep intelligence on the matter. \n\nHowever, the probability is not higher because the gap between the parties' official positions remains vast. The US demands for complete dismantlement of centrifuges and removal of all enriched uranium are fundamentally at odds with Iran's 'red line' of maintaining a peaceful civilian program. These opposing stances represent a significant hurdle that requires major concessions, which could prove politically untenable for either administration. The continued imposition of US sanctions during negotiations also introduces friction and undermines trust, potentially torpedoing the process. My forecast of 65% reflects a situation where the political will and negotiation momentum appear strong enough to likely overcome the difficult, but not insurmountable, technical and political obstacles before the July 1st deadline.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of a joint draft text being finalized or a public announcement of a breakthrough on a key sticking point like enrichment levels. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast significantly if a scheduled round of talks were cancelled without a new date, or if either side made a public statement accusing the other of negotiating in bad faith.",
