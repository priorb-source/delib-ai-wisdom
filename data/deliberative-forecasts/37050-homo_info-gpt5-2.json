    "review": "Both forecasters sharpened the base-rate framing by focusing on “event days” rather than number of constituents swapped. That’s a better hazard model for a short window: 2013, 2015, 2018, 2020, 2024 = ~5 events in ~12 years (~0.42/year). Over ~2.2 months, that implies ~7–9% via Poisson, lower than my earlier 12% which implicitly over-counted multi-name changes in a single event. They also convincingly argue that two 2024 changes reduce near-term appetite for more tinkering absent a concrete catalyst, and that there’s no credible reporting or corporate action on the horizon. The reminder about price-weight constraints (especially for adds like Meta) and lack of an obvious, time-bound trigger (splits, M&A, distress) further supports a low probability. I didn’t identify any new hard evidence, but the reframed base rate and stability argument post-2024 are persuasive.",
    "rationale": "Updating to an event-day base rate (~0.42/year) over ~0.18 years gives ~7.3%. Qualitatively, there are plausible removal narratives (Boeing’s ongoing issues; 3M’s reduced profile post-spin; Verizon/legacy tech representation), and only one removal would resolve Yes. However, there is: (1) no concrete catalyst or imminent corporate action among constituents; (2) a recent substantial refresh in 2024 that likely lowers the committee’s near-term hazard; (3) no credible media chatter. Those push me below my prior 12%. I keep a small premium over the pure base rate to account for the committee’s ability to act without notice and the existence of a few plausible candidates if something breaks. Net: 9%.",
