  "information": "Sweeping new tariffs were implemented by the US administration on April 2, 2025, which were followed by retaliatory measures from multiple countries. Subsequent shipping data showed that China-US bookings were down 45% year-over-year. Additionally, manufacturing PMI reports from the period indicated contracting activity in the sector.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks. The US Census Bureau typically releases the international trade data for a given month in the first week of the second subsequent month (e.g., April data is released in early June).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. While the long-term trend might have been slow export growth, the recent implementation of sweeping tariffs and retaliatory measures in early April 2025 has fundamentally altered the status quo. The current trajectory, based on this major shock, is for a contraction in trade.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The new US tariffs and the swift, significant retaliatory measures from major trading partners severely curtail US export activity throughout April. The reported 45% year-over-year drop in China-US shipping bookings and contracting manufacturing PMIs are reflected in the final data, causing total export value to fall below the April 2024 level of $262.578 billion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The negative impact of the tariffs is slower to materialize than anticipated, with many April shipments occurring under contracts signed before the policy change. Alternatively, a surge in high-value exports, such as petroleum or aircraft, to non-retaliating countries compensates for the decline in trade with China and others. A sharp depreciation of the US dollar during the month could also inflate the nominal value of exports, pushing the total over the threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the recent, high-impact events outlined in my research assistant's report. The baseline expectation of modest export growth has been superseded by the economic shock of a new trade war initiated on April 2, 2025. The evidence pointing to a decrease in exports is strong and multifaceted. Firstly, the implementation of sweeping tariffs by the US and immediate retaliation by other nations creates direct barriers to trade, reducing demand for US goods. Secondly, the provided leading indicators are compelling: a 45% year-over-year drop in China-US shipping bookings is a direct and substantial signal of reduced trade volume with a key partner. Thirdly, the contraction in manufacturing PMI reports suggests that the industrial sector, which produces many export goods, is slowing down. The combination of these factors makes an increase in export value highly improbable.\n\nMy probability is not lower (closer to 0) because there is still some uncertainty. The provided shipping data is specific to China; it's possible that trade with other regions like the EU or Latin America remained resilient or even grew. Furthermore, large, lumpy exports in sectors like aerospace can sometimes distort monthly figures unexpectedly. The final number is also subject to statistical noise and revisions. \n\nMy probability is not higher (e.g., above 25) because the evidence for a trade contraction is direct, timely, and comes from multiple sources (policy changes, shipping data, and economic surveys). It is difficult to construct a plausible scenario where exports grow amidst such significant headwinds.\n\nI would update my forecast towards 'Yes' if reports emerged that retaliatory tariffs were significantly weaker than expected or that major export deals to non-retaliating nations were fulfilled in April. I would become more confident in 'No' if further data, such as declining export orders with other key partners like the EU, became available.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US exports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of exports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 262,578 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSweeping new tariffs were implemented by the US administration on April 2, 2025, which were followed by retaliatory measures from multiple countries. Subsequent shipping data showed that China-US bookings were down 45% year-over-year. Additionally, manufacturing PMI reports from the period indicated contracting activity in the sector.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
