  "information": "On May 6, 2025, Ramzan Kadyrov publicly stated that he was asking to be relieved of his duties, expressing a hope that his request would be supported to allow for new leadership in the region. He subsequently clarified on his Telegram channel that the final decision rests solely with Russian President Vladimir Putin, stating, \"I do not decide whether I will remain as the head of the Chechen Republic or not.\" By May 12, Kadyrov again addressed the rumors, attributing his recent serious demeanor not to a potential resignation, but to the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine, in which he said 11,000 Chechen troops were involved.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days remain until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Kadyrov remains as head of the Chechen Republic",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Kadyrov continues as head of the Chechen Republic through June 1, 2025. Putin does not accept or act on the resignation request, treating it as political messaging rather than a genuine intention to step down. Kadyrov's May 12 comments about focusing on Ukraine operations indicate business as usual.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Putin accepts Kadyrov's May 6 resignation request within the next 20 days. The formal process of transitioning leadership occurs quickly, with a new head of the Chechen Republic appointed and officially taking office before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors Kadyrov remaining in power. He has been head of Chechen Republic since 2007, making him a deeply entrenched and strategically important Putin ally who maintains stability in a historically volatile region. While Kadyrov did state on May 6 that he wants to step down, several factors suggest this is unlikely to materialize before June 1: First, he immediately clarified that the decision rests solely with Putin, signaling this may have been performative rather than a firm resignation. Second, his May 12 comments attribute his recent serious demeanor to Ukraine operations - not to resignation plans - suggesting continuity rather than departure. Third, only 20 days remain, an extremely short timeframe for a major leadership transition in Russian politics even if Putin were inclined to accept. Fourth, there's no indication Putin wants to replace such a key regional ally. Fifth, in Russian politics, such public statements are often political theater or loyalty tests rather than genuine intentions. The probability is not higher because there's a non-zero chance this was a genuine resignation Putin might accept, or unforeseen health/political circumstances could force a change. The probability is not lower because Kadyrov did make the statement publicly, creating some possibility. To move higher, I'd need evidence of Putin accepting the resignation or credible reports of immediate succession planning. To move lower, I'd need explicit Putin statements rejecting the resignation or Kadyrov unambiguously walking back his comments.",
