  "information": "The U.S. State Department uses a four-level travel advisory system. Level 1 is 'Exercise Normal Precautions.' Level 2 is 'Exercise Increased Caution,' for heightened safety and security risks. Level 3, 'Reconsider Travel,' signifies serious risks. Level 4, 'Do Not Travel,' is the highest level, typically applied in cases of widespread violent conflict, civil war, uncontrolled crime, risk of wrongful detention, or severe breakdowns in national infrastructure. The advisories are determined based on factors including crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and health concerns. The State Department reviews advisories for Level 3 and 4 countries at least every six months.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Mozambique remains below Level 4 (historically Level 2 with Do Not Travel restrictions for parts of the north, or at most Level 3).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Localized unrest and sporadic terrorism continue (e.g., in Cabo Delgado), but security conditions do not deteriorate nationwide; the U.S. maintains normal embassy operations; the State Department keeps Mozambique at Level 2 or 3 with area-specific Do Not Travel notices.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp, nationwide security collapse: major escalation of terrorist activity into key urban centers (e.g., Maputo, Beira, Nampula), widespread violent unrest or crackdown, targeted attacks/kidnappings of foreigners, or a severe disaster that cripples infrastructure and prompts U.S. drawdown/evacuation—leading the State Department to upgrade Mozambique to Level 4 for the entire country.",
    "rationale": "Base rates and recent history point strongly toward No over the next two months. Level 4 (“Do Not Travel”) is reserved for the most severe environments—active war, systemic state collapse, pervasive kidnapping/terrorism, or extreme infrastructure breakdown. Mozambique’s risks have been significant but largely localized, especially in Cabo Delgado, which the State Department has historically flagged with area-specific Do Not Travel guidance while keeping the national level below 4. The cited ATTA advisory about protests signals episodic unrest, but the U.S. rarely sets a nationwide Level 4 solely for protests unless they trigger broad, sustained violence and a breakdown of state capacity. The State Department can update advisories at any time, but the assistant’s note that Level 3/4 countries are reviewed at least every six months underscores that big changes are not routine and usually event-driven.\n\nWhy not higher: To hit Level 4 by July 1 would likely require a sudden, severe, nationwide deterioration—e.g., mass-casualty attacks in major cities, targeted risks to foreigners, or major operational curbs at the U.S. Embassy. There’s no strong evidence this is imminent. Comparable countries with significant but localized insurgencies typically sit at Level 2 or 3, not 4.\n\nWhy not lower: There is non-zero risk from the Cabo Delgado insurgency, potential flare-ups of civil unrest, and the small chance of a late-season severe weather or public health shock. A surprise escalation that reaches major population centers or disrupts governance could prompt a rapid advisory upgrade.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports of large, coordinated attacks in major cities; rapid spread of insurgent activity beyond the north; targeted kidnappings/killings of foreigners; U.S. Embassy drawdowns or ordered departures; multiple urgent Security Alerts from the Embassy; suspension of key industrial operations (e.g., LNG) due to security collapse.\n\nWhat would move me down: A fresh State Department update reaffirming Level 2/3; evidence that protests have subsided without nationwide violence; continued containment of insurgent activity to remote areas; normal embassy posture and travel operations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mozambique receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMSN: [ATTA issues travel advisory for Mozambique amid protests](https://www.msn.com/en-za/travel/travel-preparation/atta-issues-travel-advisory-for-mozambique-amid-protests/ar-AA1wHavB?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Mozambique has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Mozambique.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. State Department uses a four-level travel advisory system. Level 1 is 'Exercise Normal Precautions.' Level 2 is 'Exercise Increased Caution,' for heightened safety and security risks. Level 3, 'Reconsider Travel,' signifies serious risks. Level 4, 'Do Not Travel,' is the highest level, typically applied in cases of widespread violent conflict, civil war, uncontrolled crime, risk of wrongful detention, or severe breakdowns in national infrastructure. The advisories are determined based on factors including crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and health concerns. The State Department reviews advisories for Level 3 and 4 countries at least every six months.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
