  "information": "According to a June 11, 2025 snapshot, Google’s Gemini-2.5-Pro model ranked first on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard with an Elo score of 1478, while OpenAI’s best model was 53 points behind. The competitive landscape in early 2025 has been characterized by a narrowing gap between top models; the Elo score difference between the top-ranked and 10th-ranked model decreased from 11.9% in 2024 to 5.4% in early 2025. Previous leaderboard leaders in 2025 have included Grok-3 by xAI, which held the top spot in February.\n\nIn mid-June 2025, OpenAI released a new model, o3-pro, which is focused on high-performance reasoning and is available to paid users. The company has delayed the release of its first open-weights model until later in the summer, and reports indicate a potential GPT-5 release is delayed until July 2025. On June 10-11, OpenAI's services, including ChatGPT, experienced a global outage caused by a system error during a software update, for which the company announced a compensation plan for paid users.\n\nChatbot Arena is a crowdsourced benchmarking platform that uses an Elo rating system based on user votes from anonymous, side-by-side model comparisons. A recent study titled 'The Leaderboard Illusion' raised concerns about the platform's fairness, suggesting major tech firms like OpenAI may have an advantage due to private testing, which allows them to selectively publish only their best-performing models to the public leaderboard. The operators of Chatbot Arena have responded to the study, stating that it contains factual errors and misinterpretations.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two weeks, as the question resolves on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of mid-June 2025, Google's Gemini-2.5-Pro holds the #1 rank, with OpenAI's top model trailing by 53 Elo points.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Google's Gemini-2.5-Pro maintains its lead, or another competitor's model surpasses it. OpenAI's new o3-pro model, while potentially strong, fails to accumulate enough positive votes in the short time remaining to close the 53-point Elo gap by the end of the quarter.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "OpenAI's recently released o3-pro model proves to be a significant leap in performance. In the final two weeks of June, crowdsourced voting on the Arena platform rapidly propels its Elo score past all competitors, securing the #1 rank by July 1st.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the significant Elo gap and the short time remaining. The status quo is that Google's Gemini-2.5-Pro leads OpenAI by 53 Elo points. In a system like Chatbot Arena, overcoming such a deficit in just two weeks is a substantial challenge. Elo ratings have inertia and require a large volume of head-to-head wins to change dramatically. The general trend of a narrowing competitive field also works against OpenAI; even if Google's model falters, another competitor like Anthropic or xAI could claim the top spot. Furthermore, reports suggesting a potential GPT-5 release is delayed until July place OpenAI's most anticipated model outside the resolution window. The primary factor making a 'Yes' outcome possible is the recent release of o3-pro. As a new model, its true performance level on the Arena is not yet established. If it is a true state-of-the-art model, it could climb the rankings very quickly. OpenAI has a strong track record of releasing leaderboard-topping models, and they would not release a new premium model unless they believed it was highly competitive. My forecast is not lower than 30% because the introduction of this new, unknown-potential model from a top lab creates significant uncertainty and a plausible, if difficult, path to victory. My forecast is not higher because the existing Elo data provides a strong prior, and the timeline severely constrains the amount of new data that can be collected to overturn that prior. I would update my forecast upwards if o3-pro shows a rapid and sustained climb in the rankings in the next 7-10 days. I would update downwards if its rank stagnates or if another competitor releases a surprisingly powerful new model.",
