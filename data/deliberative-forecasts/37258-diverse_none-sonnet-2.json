    "review": "The other forecasters raised several important contextual points I hadn't fully considered. Most significantly: (1) John Swinney's leadership style focuses on competence and stability rather than constitutional confrontation, which is a meaningful departure from previous SNP positioning; (2) The SNP's weak performance in the 2024 UK general election and current minority government status creates structural disincentives for bold moves; (3) The precedent of Nicola Sturgeon's October 2023 announcement that passed without event makes current leadership much more cautious about making promises they cannot deliver; (4) Both forecasters effectively articulated why such an announcement would be strategically counterproductive - 'high-risk with little tangible reward' that could demoralize supporters. These are compelling arguments that suggest my initial forecast was too high.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I believe I should update my forecast downward. The key information that moves me lower: (1) Current political context is worse than I initially assessed - the SNP is in a minority government position after electoral setbacks, which reduces their capacity and incentive for dramatic moves; (2) John Swinney's documented focus on stability over constitutional confrontation is a leadership-level constraint; (3) The precedent of the 2023 date announcement that failed suggests learned caution; (4) With only 60 days remaining and no signals or preparatory work visible, the window is extremely tight. However, I'm not going as low as 4% because: (1) The resolution criteria remain lenient - only requiring an announcement by Scottish authority, not UK legality; (2) 60 days, while short, is not zero; (3) A purely symbolic or politically motivated announcement remains possible, even if unlikely. The strategic arguments against are very strong, but the low bar for resolution keeps some small probability alive. I'm updating to 6%, splitting the difference between my original 8% and the consensus 4-5% range.",
