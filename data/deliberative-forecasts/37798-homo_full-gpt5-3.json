    "review": "Both forecasters largely echo my prior reasoning: short horizon favors current leaders, Dodgers’ true-talent is elite, and multiple viable contenders keep any single-team probability modest. They explicitly lean on tie-counting (which I also assume) and emphasize regression risk for surprise leaders, plus the possibility of a short Dodgers heater. Neither adds new concrete schedule or injury-timeline data, but they sharpen the status-quo weighting and competitive field framing. I find their arguments sound and consistent with my view; no major new evidence, but their emphasis on ties and recent proximity to the top nudges me slightly upward.",
    "rationale": "Time until resolution is short (~4 weeks), so standings inertia matters; LA is currently just off the top after a sweep. Their underlying quality remains among MLB’s best (PECOTA/betting priors; elite offense), supporting a non-trivial chance to surge. Headwinds are near-term pitching health and the presence of several strong rivals (Phillies, Yankees/Orioles, Mets, Tigers/Braves). On a specific date, even the strongest team rarely exceeds ~one-quarter odds to be alone or tied for best record. With ties counting and LA very near the lead, I edge up slightly from my prior 25% to 26%. I’d move higher with a 7–10 game run or positive rotation news, lower if a rival separates or LA suffers new injuries.",
