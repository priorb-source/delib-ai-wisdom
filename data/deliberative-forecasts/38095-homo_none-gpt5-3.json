    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the low threshold and Trump’s tendency to act in batches, which I agree raises upside risk in any given month. New points they surfaced that I hadn’t explicitly weighed: June-specific hooks (Trump’s June 14 birthday, Juneteenth), and the end-of-June SCOTUS decision window as a potential news-cycle anchor. They also highlight tactical reasons to delay (negative May coverage, preference for July 4 symbolism) and the disclosure-timing risk. I find the July 4 timing argument and the lack of any concrete June reporting more persuasive than the June 14/SCOTUS hooks. Forecaster 2’s 47% feels high absent specific signals; Forecaster 3’s 30% aligns more with base rates. Net effect: slight downward pull from my prior, given stronger July optics and no June-specific intel.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: Monthly clemency activity is lumpy with many zero months; without specific signals, the default is 0–2 grants in a given month. \n- Trump-specific: He favors episodic, sometimes high-profile batches, which means when he acts, clearing >2 is easy. The Guardian piece suggests willingness to use clemency early in term, keeping a nontrivial tail risk each month. \n- June factors: There are plausible hooks (birthday, Juneteenth, late-June SCOTUS). However, July 4 is a more compelling symbolic target for a larger package, and negative press in May could incentivize spacing or bundling into early July. The requirement that actions be publicly disclosed within June adds timing risk if announcements slip past month-end. \n- Net: Low bar but no concrete June signals; optics favor early July. I trim slightly from my prior to reflect the month-specific timing risk outweighing the modest June catalysts.\n",
