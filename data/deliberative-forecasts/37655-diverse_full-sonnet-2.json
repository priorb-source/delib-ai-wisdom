    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that have caused me to reconsider my forecast. Forecaster 2 emphasizes a crucial point I underweighted: the martial law extension happened literally yesterday (May 15), which is extremely recent and concrete evidence of the government's intentions. Forecaster 3's point about status quo bias is also strong - governments rarely reverse fresh legislative decisions within weeks. Both correctly identify that Poroshenko's claims come from an opposition figure with political motivations, and anonymous sources are weak evidence against official denials. However, I find Forecaster 2's 2% slightly too low given that we're dealing with a 45-day window where unexpected political developments (peace breakthroughs, international pressure) remain possible, even if unlikely. Forecaster 3's 6% forecast appears well-calibrated and similar to my original reasoning, appropriately balancing the strong legal/political barriers against tail-risk scenarios.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm updating my forecast downward from 7% to 6%. The key factor driving this revision is the timing and recency of the martial law extension. The Verkhovna Rada extended martial law just yesterday (May 15, 2025), demonstrating fresh, concrete evidence that the government sees no path toward elections in the near term. If there were any intention to announce elections before July 1, extending martial law for another three months would be directly counterproductive. This recent legislative action, combined with explicit official denials from Zelensky's office, creates an even stronger status quo than I initially weighted. The 90-day advance scheduling requirement means that even if martial law were lifted tomorrow, the legal framework reinforces planning timelines incompatible with a pre-July 1 announcement. However, I'm not moving as low as 2% because 45 days remains a non-trivial window in wartime politics where unexpected developments (rapid peace progress, extraordinary international pressure, or unforeseen political realignments) could theoretically materialize. The 6% forecast appropriately captures this: highly unlikely given all structural barriers, but not dismissive of low-probability tail scenarios.",
