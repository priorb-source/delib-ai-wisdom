    "review": "Both forecasters emphasized distinctions I largely agree with: (1) program elimination ≠ immediate domain takedown; (2) .gov decommissioning typically takes coordination and time; (3) redirects or a static sunset page would still register as “up” by the resolution source. New and persuasive to me was the point that Metaculus can check any time on or after July 1, which reduces the chance that a transient outage determines the outcome. Their emphasis on business-day timing and measurement nuance slightly lowers operational risk relative to my prior. I didn’t see compelling counterarguments that would push the probability down; the main downside remains a deliberate, symbolic pre–July 1 takedown or a DNS-level retirement, which I still view as possible but unlikely within the short horizon.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: ~7 weeks until July 1, 2025.\n- Status quo: energystar.gov is currently up; federal web properties typically persist during transitions, often with notices/archives.\n- No outcome scenarios: a deliberate domain shutdown before July 1 (DNS records pulled or domain blocked), a hosting migration misstep causing sustained unreachability, or an unfortunate transient outage precisely when Metaculus checks. The latter risk is further reduced since Metaculus can check after July 1.\n- Yes outcome scenarios: domain remains responsive even if content is frozen, replaced by a sunset notice, or redirected (which the monitor likely counts as up). Records management, stakeholder reliance, and inertia favor keeping the domain live for months, not weeks.\n- Update vs. prior: I slightly raise my forecast due to the measurement-timing point (Metaculus’s flexibility reduces outage risk) and the short horizon reinforcing institutional inertia. I still reserve some probability for a politically motivated, rapid takedown, but see it as a minority scenario given typical federal practices and the ease of leaving a static/redirected presence.\n",
