    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 23 days. The final report for June 2025 is expected to be released on Friday, June 27, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes (>60.0). Historically, the Consumer Sentiment Index rarely drops below 60.0 except during severe economic crises. Even with a reported plunge in May 2025, readings below 60 have only occurred a handful of times in the index's history, such as the record low of 50.0 in June 2022 during peak inflation concerns.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment remains at or below 60.0 if the May 2025 plunge continues into June. This could occur if tariff-related disruptions intensify, causing sustained pessimism about economic conditions, employment prospects, and purchasing power. Additional negative shocks such as stock market volatility, rising unemployment claims, or escalating geopolitical tensions could keep sentiment depressed at historically low levels.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The June reading exceeds 60.0 if May's plunge was a temporary shock that begins to stabilize or reverse. This could happen if tariff concerns ease, inflation expectations moderate, or positive economic data (strong employment, wage growth) emerges. Even a modest recovery from a very low May reading could push June above the 60.0 threshold, as consumer sentiment can rebound quickly when triggering events resolve or adapt.",
    "rationale": "The question structure and the reference to a May 2025 'consumer sentiment plunge' suggest we are dealing with a period of low consumer confidence. However, the 60.0 threshold is historically significant - readings below this level are extremely rare and typically only occur during major economic crises. The index has only dipped below 60 a few times in its history, most notably hitting 50.0 in June 2022. Given the status quo bias principle, I must consider that even with recent negative news, the index spending extended time below 60 would be exceptional. The tariff-related concerns mentioned could certainly depress sentiment, but consumers often adapt to new information quickly. Without concrete data on May's actual reading, I'm inferring from the question that we're likely near the 60.0 boundary. The probability leans toward 'Yes' because: (1) historical rarity of sub-60 readings suggests reversion toward higher values, (2) consumer sentiment is volatile and can recover month-to-month, (3) even severe drops often see partial rebounds. My forecast is not higher because the May plunge indicates genuine economic stress, and tariff impacts could be persistent. It's not lower because sustained readings below 60 require truly exceptional circumstances that, while possible, are not the base case. I would revise upward with news of tariff resolution, strong economic data, or preliminary June survey results showing improvement. I would revise downward with evidence of deepening economic distress, escalating trade tensions, or preliminary readings suggesting continued decline.",
