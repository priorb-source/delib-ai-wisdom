  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (through June 30, 2025; determinable by July 1)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — absent clear evidence Kalshi is already running daily real-money MLB markets, and given regulatory headwinds on sports event contracts, the default is that they will not meet an every-day-in-June condition.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi either does not list any MLB game markets at all due to regulatory constraints (CFTC treatment of sports as prohibited “gaming”/public-interest concerns), or they list MLB markets inconsistently and miss at least one calendar day in June (e.g., operational hiccup, compliance pause, site outage, holiday/weekend gap, or a game day with no corresponding market).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi has an approved, automated pipeline for MLB markets and lists at least one real-money market tied to a game every single day of June 2025 without interruption (e.g., a “Team X to win today” contract) and no regulatory or operational disruptions occur.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and base rates: The CFTC has historically been skeptical of sports event contracts on DCMs (e.g., the 2021 ErisX NFL proposal was disapproved as contrary to the public interest/gaming). I have not seen definitive public evidence that Kalshi currently lists real-money MLB game markets. The provided research assistant had no additional info, so I cannot confirm active daily MLB offerings.\n- Status quo weighting: In the absence of clear confirmation that Kalshi already runs daily MLB markets, and given past CFTC posture on sports contracts, the most likely outcome is that Kalshi does not satisfy an every-day-in-June requirement. Even if Kalshi is experimenting with sports, the criterion is strict: a single missed day yields a No.\n- Regulatory overhang: The linked article about a judge moving quickly on a Kalshi case signals ongoing regulatory/legal flux (albeit primarily around election markets). That uncertainty modestly increases the chance of pauses or product adjustments that could incidentally affect any sports listings.\n- Operational risk: Even if sports markets are live, daily continuity has non-zero failure risk (weekend/holiday coverage, data-feed errors, maintenance downtime). Strict “every day” conditions tend to underperform intuitive expectations.\nWhy not higher: If Kalshi were already demonstrably posting MLB markets every day, I’d raise this substantially, but absent that confirmation and given CFTC history on sports = gaming/public interest, the prior leans against.\nWhy not lower: Kalshi is an agile, well-capitalized DCM and could have developed compliant structures or narrowed contract designs to fit within permissible event categories. If I observe MLB markets live on June 1 and continuing daily for the first week, I would update upward quickly.\nUpdates that would move the forecast:\n- Up: Verified real-money MLB markets listed on Kalshi on June 1 and sustained daily through the first several days; any public CFTC signal tolerating sports event contracts on a DCM; evidence of an automated daily listing pipeline.\n- Down: Any CFTC/court action curtailing new event categories; a day early in June with no MLB markets on Kalshi; announcements that sports offerings are play-money-only or paused.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
