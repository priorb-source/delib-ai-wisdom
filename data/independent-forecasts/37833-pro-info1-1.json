  "information": "The relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has recently shown signs of strain. After investing heavily in Trump's 2024 campaign, Musk was appointed co-director of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). However, disagreements arose over Musk's proposals for drastic government spending cuts and his support for policies like H-1B visas, which conflicted with Trump's agenda. In May 2025, Musk announced he would reduce his political involvement and spending to focus on his businesses, leading to a mutually agreed-upon withdrawal from his role in DOGE. Correspondingly, analyses show that Trump has not mentioned Musk on his Truth Social account in over a month, a significant decrease from his previous frequency.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks. The deadline for the tweet is July 1, 2025, and today is May 22, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Neither Donald Trump nor Elon Musk are currently focused on the Diversity Visa program, and the existing political conditions suggest this is unlikely to change in the short term.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Elon Musk continues to focus on his business ventures and avoids niche political commentary, as indicated by his recent withdrawal from his government role. Donald Trump's attention remains on broader immigration themes and other presidential duties, and no specific news event occurs to make the Diversity Visa program a top-of-mind issue for him to post about on X before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A high-profile news event, such as a national security incident or a major crime involving a Diversity Visa recipient, propels the program into the national spotlight. In response, Donald Trump, known for his reactive social media use and strong views on immigration, posts on X using the exact phrase 'diversity visa' to condemn the program.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the low base rate of either individual using this specific, technical phrase ('diversity visa') and the current political context provided by my research assistant. The key information is that Elon Musk is deliberately reducing his political involvement to focus on his businesses. This makes a relevant tweet from him extremely unlikely, reducing the chance of a 'Yes' outcome by roughly half. The probability therefore rests almost entirely on Donald Trump. While Trump has historically been a vocal critic of the program, several factors suppress the probability. First, the timeframe is very short (under six weeks). Second, the resolution requires the exact phrase, and his commentary on the topic has often used other terms like 'visa lottery'. Third, a specific catalyst, such as a major news story, would likely be required to bring this niche topic to the forefront of his attention, and such an event is not guaranteed. My forecast is not lower than 5% because Trump remains an unpredictable and high-volume social media user who is ideologically primed to comment on this topic if a trigger event occurs. The probability is not higher because the provided intelligence strongly suggests Musk is no longer a factor, and the confluence of a triggering event and a specific tweet from Trump within the short time window remains a low-probability scenario. I would increase my forecast if news surfaced of a legislative push to end the program or a significant negative event linked to a visa recipient.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet (X post) about the Diversity Visa before April 1, 2025\n\nQuestion background:\n[Federal judge’s order leaves many visa lottery winners out of luck](https://www.siliconvalley.com/2020/10/01/judges-order-leaves-many-visa-lottery-winners-out-of-luck/) | Recent tweet [here](https://x.com/fentasyl/status/1894451029934039492) from a Twitter/X account followed by Elon Musk.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025 either Donald Trump or Elon Musk tweet using the exact words \"diversity visa\" as shown through [this search](https://x.com/search?f=top&q=%22diversity%20visa%22%20(from%3Arealdonaldtrump%20OR%20from%3Aelonmusk)&src=typed_query) on Twitter/X, which will be checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If a tweet (now renamed to X post) containing the phrase is seen by a Metaculus Admin at that time, this question resolves as **Yes**. If not, it resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe relationship between Elon Musk and Donald Trump has recently shown signs of strain.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
