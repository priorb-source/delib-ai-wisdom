    "review": "My initial forecast was 90%, while both other forecasters arrived at 95%. All three of us identified the same central tension: the specific and recent NOAA spokesperson statement promising the site will remain online versus the broader political context and demonstrated willingness of the administration to remove climate data resources. The key difference was the weight assigned to these competing factors. I found the other forecasters' arguments highly convincing, particularly their strong emphasis on two points I had perhaps undervalued. First is the sheer force of institutional and bureaucratic inertia; the practical difficulty of taking a major government website offline in just over 40 days is a significant barrier. Second, as Forecaster 3 noted, taking down the entire Climate.gov domain is a far more visible and politically costly action than the steps taken so far (like decommissioning a database), making it a less likely immediate step. These arguments successfully convinced me that the risk of a 'No' outcome is lower than I initially estimated.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analysis, I am updating my forecast from 90% to 95%. My initial 10% probability for a 'No' outcome was based on the significant political risk posed by an administration actively working to curtail climate information access. However, Forecasters 2 and 3 persuaded me that I was under-weighting the practical constraints of the very short timeframe for resolution. The combination of bureaucratic inertia, the technical process required for a shutdown, and the high public and political visibility of shuttering a primary domain like Climate.gov makes such an action highly improbable in the next 40 days. The direct statement from the NOAA spokesperson on April 4th, while not an absolute guarantee, creates an additional political hurdle to a sudden reversal. A 5% chance of a 'No' outcome better reflects the possibility of a sudden, high-level executive order that overrides these significant practical and political barriers, but acknowledges that such an event is a low-probability risk.",
