  "information": "The Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) has been the leading party in every Viennese state election since 1945.\n\nPublic polls from outlets such as ElectsWorld and ORF ahead of the April 27, 2025, election consistently showed the SPÖ with 38-40% of the vote, compared to the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) with 21-24%, indicating a lead of 16-19 percentage points.\n\nThe SPÖ is the incumbent party governing Vienna and is noted to have a well-established and entrenched local party organization.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "6 days (election is on April 27, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "SPÖ wins the most seats, continuing their unbroken dominance of Viennese politics since 1945",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FPÖ or another party overtakes the SPÖ, requiring either massive polling error or an unprecedented 16-19 point swing in the final 6 days, possibly driven by a major last-minute scandal or systematic underestimation of right-wing vote share",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The SPÖ maintains their current polling lead through election day and wins a plurality of seats, as all current polling and historical precedent suggests",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors an SPÖ victory. My research assistant reports that SPÖ has won every Viennese state election since 1945, establishing an 80-year pattern of dominance. Current polling from multiple outlets shows SPÖ at 38-40% versus FPÖ at 21-24%, a commanding 16-19 percentage point lead with only 6 days until voting. The SPÖ also benefits from incumbency and a well-established local party organization. For the SPÖ to lose from this position would require either: (1) catastrophic polling error of historic proportions, (2) a late-breaking scandal of unprecedented impact, or (3) a voter swing that has no precedent in Austrian politics. While elections always carry some uncertainty, the combination of massive polling lead, extremely short timeframe, consistent results across multiple polls, and unbroken historical dominance makes an SPÖ loss highly unlikely. I'm not forecasting higher (98%+) because: polling errors do occur, late-breaking events are possible, and some epistemic humility is warranted even with strong evidence. I'm not forecasting lower because the evidence is overwhelming - a 16-19 point lead with 6 days left is nearly insurmountable. I would update higher if final polls showed an even larger lead or if the FPÖ explicitly conceded likely defeat. I would update lower only if credible reports emerged of dramatic late polling tightening or a major SPÖ scandal.",
