  "information": "The platform faces legal and regulatory challenges. A judge in Nevada is expected to rule quickly on a case involving Kalshi's prediction markets. Major sports leagues have voiced concerns; the NBA has cited 'substantial integrity risks' due to a perceived lack of regulatory oversight compared to traditional sportsbooks, and Major League Baseball has highlighted the need for consumer protections equivalent to state-level regulations. In response, Kalshi has announced plans to enhance user protections, including voluntary opt-outs, self-imposed trading breaks, and deposit caps.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (by July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Kalshi continues to list at least one real-money market on an MLB game each day in June, as it appears to be doing now.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A Nevada judge issues a TRO/preliminary injunction that prompts Kalshi to pause all sports markets (even temporarily) while implementing legal/technical changes; or Kalshi voluntarily suspends sports to mitigate regulatory risk; or they simply fail to post a market on one calendar day (e.g., operational lapse or outage).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The court either denies broad injunctive relief or limits it to Nevada, and Kalshi swiftly geofences Nevada if needed; operations remain stable; MLB has games every day and Kalshi posts at least one game market daily without gaps.",
    "rationale": "- Framing: The bar is high — the platform must offer at least one MLB game market every single day in June. One missed day resolves the question as No.\n- Status quo and incentives: Kalshi appears to already be listing daily sports markets, including MLB, which suggests operational readiness to keep posting them. Their business incentives favor continuity, and they can geofence specific jurisdictions if necessary.\n- Legal/regulatory risk: Per the assistant’s report and the LV Review-Journal, a Nevada judge plans a quick ruling, with NBA/MLB raising integrity and consumer-protection concerns. Even if the judge’s order is aimed at Nevada consumers, Kalshi might opt for a temporary nationwide pause to ensure compliance or to implement changes (deposit caps, trading breaks, opt-outs) — a pause of even one day would trigger a No. CFTC posture on sports event contracts adds background uncertainty, though the immediate risk in June seems more tied to the Nevada case.\n- Operational risk: Even absent legal shocks, there is a small chance of a listing gap (site outage, staffing/automation hiccup). Over a 30-day run, small daily risks compound.\n- Why not higher: The combination of an imminent court decision, vocal league opposition, and the fragility of the “every day” criterion materially increases the odds of at least one interruption.\n- Why not lower: Kalshi can likely contain Nevada-specific risk via geofencing; they have strong incentives to prove reliability; MLB schedules include games every day in June, so supply of eligible events is not a constraint; and Kalshi has announced enhanced protections to address stakeholder concerns.\n- What would move me up: Clear public commitment from Kalshi to maintain daily MLB markets in June plus evidence they’ve already geofenced Nevada (if needed); first week of uninterrupted listings; a court decision explicitly allowing continued operations outside Nevada.\n- What would move me down: Any TRO/preliminary injunction impacting sports markets; Kalshi pausing sports even briefly; reports of CFTC intervention against sports markets; a missed listing day early in June (which would immediately resolve to No).",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
