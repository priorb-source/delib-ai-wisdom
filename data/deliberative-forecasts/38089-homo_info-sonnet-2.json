    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides the CRITICAL piece of information I was missing: actual May 8, 2025 data showing Sánchez leading Erdoğan 35% to 32%. This is recent data (only ~3 weeks old) with just 33 days remaining until resolution. This fundamentally changes my analysis, which was based on historical patterns suggesting Erdoğan typically leads. Forecaster 2's reasoning about status quo bias over short timeframes is sound, and the 72% forecast appropriately reflects the combination of current lead plus time decay. Forecaster 3 lacks this current data and their 42% forecast reflects that information deficit - their reasoning would be sound if we didn't have May 8 data, but we do. The 3-point lead is modest but real, and with only about 7-8 weeks from the May 8 measurement to July 1, substantial shifts are unlikely without major precipitating events. Forecaster 2's note about Spain's economic recovery is relevant positive context, though Turkey's improving consumer confidence presents some countervailing pressure.",
    "rationale": "I initially severely underestimated the probability at 35% because I assumed historical patterns where Erdoğan typically maintained higher approval. However, Forecaster 2's May 8, 2025 data showing Sánchez already leading 35% to 32% completely changes the calculus. With Sánchez holding a 3-point lead just 3 weeks ago and only 33 days until resolution, status quo bias should dominate. Approval ratings exhibit substantial inertia over such short periods absent major crises. The evidence supporting maintenance of Sánchez's lead includes: (1) very short remaining timeframe, (2) Spain's economic recovery providing stability, (3) no indication of imminent crises. The risks to this forecast include: (1) the 3-point margin is modest and within normal monthly variation, (2) Turkey's improving consumer confidence could translate to approval gains, (3) Erdoğan's constitutional reform initiative might energize his base. However, these risks are insufficient to overcome the strong status quo bias. Forecaster 2's 72% is well-calibrated. I'm adjusting to 68% - slightly more conservative than Forecaster 2 given the modest lead size and Turkey's positive economic indicators, but dramatically higher than my initial underestimate.",
