    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully emphasizes that most late-stage UFC main events do proceed and that the first fight offered a replicable stylistic edge for Merab; their conditional mid-to-high 60s feels directionally right if the rematch resembles the first. Their nod to judging trends toward damage is a fair moderating factor. Forecaster 3 adds the (new to me) claim that Merab beat Umar Nurmagomedov in Jan 2025; if accurate, that strengthens confidence in Merab’s current form and activity. I find F3’s mid-teens cancellation/replacement risk a bit high given the short runway; I’d lean closer to single digits to low teens. Overall, F2’s reasoning is most persuasive, while F3’s added context on Merab’s recent win (if true) nudges upward, but their final 52% seems too conservative relative to the prior head-to-head and style dynamics.",
    "rationale": "I started at 54%, balancing Merab’s clear, repeatable path (pressure, chain wrestling, cardio over five rounds) against O’Malley’s knockout threat, rematch adjustments, and some fight-fallout risk. The additional perspectives push me modestly upward: (1) Conditional on the fight happening, I now estimate Merab around 64–66% based on the decisive first meeting and stable stylistic advantages. (2) If Forecaster 3’s note about a Jan 2025 win over Umar is accurate, it reinforces that Merab’s form and durability remain high. (3) Event-change risk with this time horizon I place around ~10% (not mid-teens). Multiplying through yields an unconditional probability near 0.65×0.90 ≈ 0.585. I’ll round to 59% to reflect lingering volatility from O’Malley’s finishing equity and judging emphasis on damage. I would move up on clean weigh-ins, strong market support for Merab, or ref/judge assignments favoring wrestling; I would move down on credible Merab injury/camp issues or convincing evidence of O’Malley’s improved TDD/scramble game.",
