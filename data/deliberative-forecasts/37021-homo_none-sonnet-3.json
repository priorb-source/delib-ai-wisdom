    "review": "The three forecasts (38%, 55%, 60%) cluster around similar uncertainty, which is unsurprising given our limited information. Forecaster 3 raises the most compelling new argument: the literal interpretation of 'one step away.' This phrase typically means 'approaching but not yet there.' If Ukraine's inflation were already at or above 15% in early-to-mid April, the article would likely state 'Ukraine is experiencing stagflation' rather than being 'one step away' from it. This linguistic framing suggests inflation was likely in the 10-14% range as of April 10.\n\nForecaster 3's status quo principle is also persuasive: absent evidence of sharp changes, we should expect continuity. If conditions were 'one step away' on April 10, they're probably still in that zone on April 22, rather than having dramatically crossed the threshold.\n\nForecaster 2's interpretation that 'one step away' could mean already at 15% seems less natural linguistically. The ambiguity argument has merit, but the more straightforward reading supports Forecaster 3's position.\n\nAll three of us acknowledge that international support and stabilization measures create countervailing pressures against runaway inflation, which is important context for a wartime economy.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm revising downward from 55% to 47%. The key factor is Forecaster 3's literal interpretation of 'one step away from stagflation.' This forward-looking language most naturally suggests that as of April 10, Ukraine had not yet reached stagflation-level inflation. If we interpret this as meaning inflation was likely 11-14% at that point, then crossing to 15%+ within the remaining 20 days becomes less probable, especially given status quo inertia and stabilization efforts.\n\nI'm not going as low as 38% because: (1) the warning was issued during April itself, suggesting genuine near-term risk; (2) war-related economic pressures remain volatile; (3) 'one step away' still indicates proximity to the threshold; and (4) there's inherent uncertainty in the exact April measurement.\n\nI'm moving down from 55% because the linguistic analysis of 'one step away' genuinely suggests 'not yet there,' and I had underweighted this semantic signal in favor of structural wartime pressures. The balance of evidence now suggests it's more likely than not that Ukraine remains just below 15%.",
