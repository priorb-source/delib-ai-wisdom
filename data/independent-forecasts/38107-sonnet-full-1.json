  "information": "Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service after posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to spell '86 47'. The number '86' can be slang for 'kill' or 'remove,' and Donald Trump is the 47th president. Following the post, Comey was interviewed by the Secret Service but was not arrested. He later deleted the post, stating, 'I didn't realize that some people associate these numbers with violence. I oppose all forms of violence, so I deleted the post.' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the investigation.\n\nSeveral public figures have called for legal action against James Comey. General Michael Flynn predicted that Comey will be indicted. The InfoWars platform cited alleged Department of Justice sources claiming Comey's indictment is 'imminent.' Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett stated that Comey could be prosecuted for the post. Current FBI Director Chris Wray reported that the agency has faced a surge in threats against Donald Trump following Comey's post, requiring agents to be diverted from other cases.\n\nAs of late May 2025, no charges have been filed against James Comey, nor have any warrants or subpoenas been issued in relation to the social media post. Legal experts suggest a prosecution faces significant hurdles due to First Amendment protections and a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that requires prosecutors to prove a subjective intent to threaten. Historically, arresting former FBI directors or other ex-cabinet-level officials is extremely rare in the United States.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "31 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - James Comey will not be arrested. As of late May 2025, despite weeks of investigation, no charges have been filed, no warrants issued, and no subpoenas served.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The investigation continues but prosecutors determine they cannot meet the burden of proof required by the 2023 Supreme Court ruling on subjective intent to threaten. First Amendment protections and the high evidentiary bar, combined with Comey's disavowal of violence, lead DOJ to decline prosecution. The 31-day window closes without any arrest.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Federal prosecutors abruptly file charges based on the seashell post, arguing they can prove subjective intent to threaten despite Comey's denial. A warrant is issued and executed within the remaining 31 days, resulting in Comey's arrest despite the unprecedented nature of arresting a former FBI director.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors No. As of late May 2025, despite an active investigation lasting weeks, no charges have been filed, no warrants issued, and no subpoenas served. This suggests prosecutors are encountering significant obstacles. Legal experts cite major hurdles including First Amendment protections and a 2023 Supreme Court ruling requiring proof of subjective intent to threaten - extremely difficult given Comey's public statement that he didn't realize the violent connotation and his disavowal of violence. Arresting former FBI directors is essentially unprecedented in US history, indicating institutional resistance to such actions. Comey was already interviewed and released without arrest, suggesting investigators found insufficient immediate grounds. With only 31 days remaining, there is very little time for the legal process to unfold: filing charges, obtaining a warrant, and executing an arrest. The calls for prosecution come primarily from political commentators (Flynn, InfoWars, Fox News analysts) rather than actual prosecutors or DOJ officials making formal announcements. InfoWars citing 'DOJ sources' about 'imminent' indictment lacks credibility given that outlet's track record. I'm not going lower than 4% because: there is an active investigation, political pressure exists, and 31 days is technically sufficient time if there were strong political will. However, the legal and institutional barriers make this very unlikely. I'm not going higher because: the investigation has already had weeks to produce charges without doing so, the legal standards are very high, and the historical precedent strongly cuts against arresting former cabinet-level officials.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFormer FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service after posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to spell '86 47'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
