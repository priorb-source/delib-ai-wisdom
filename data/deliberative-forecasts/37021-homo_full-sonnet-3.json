    "review": "The other forecasters present clustering forecasts of 77-78% compared to my 72%, with largely similar analytical frameworks. They identified the same key factors I did: the acceleration trend (12.9% → 13.4% → 14.6%), the proximity to the 15.0% threshold (just 0.4 percentage points away), the NBU's explicit Q2 peak forecast, and structural war-related pressures. The most compelling new argument is Forecaster 2's timing point: we're already on April 22nd, meaning approximately two-thirds of the month has passed under the same conditions that produced March's acceleration. This substantially reduces the probability that April will deviate significantly from March's trajectory. If major disinflationary forces were going to materialize in April, we would likely have seen signals by now - reports of price stabilization, changes in policy, or supply improvements. Both forecasters also explicitly noted that the NBU expects the decline 'during the summer,' not in April, which reinforces that April should remain in the peak period. These arguments are convincing because they properly weight the temporal dimension: the later we are in the month without evidence of change, the higher the probability the status quo persists. However, I want to avoid pure anchoring to the group consensus and maintain appropriate uncertainty about economic data compilation and potential surprises. The timing argument warrants an upward update but not full convergence.",
    "rationale": "My original 72% forecast appropriately identified the key dynamics but underweighted the temporal constraint. Being 2/3 through April with no visible shift in the underlying pressures significantly increases the likelihood of crossing 15.0%. The structural factors (war disruptions, infrastructure damage, food price pressures of 17.4% YoY, housing/utilities at 20.2% YoY) remain firmly in place. The monthly acceleration from 0.8% to 1.5% shows momentum, not deceleration. The NBU's own forecast explicitly places the inflation peak in Q2 2025 with decline expected in summer months, not April. The countervailing factors I identified (tight monetary policy, potential early seasonal effects, demand weakness) haven't changed, but they appear less likely to manifest strongly enough in the remaining 8 days of April to prevent crossing the threshold. The timing argument substantially narrows the probability distribution toward a Yes outcome. I'm updating upward to 76% - meaningfully higher than my original forecast due to the temporal consideration, but maintaining some buffer (not going to 77-78%) to account for inherent uncertainty in economic data compilation and my desire to avoid pure herding toward the group mean.",
