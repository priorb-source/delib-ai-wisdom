    "review": "Both forecasters’ narratives are directionally consistent with a low probability of a pre‑July cut. I agree with their emphasis on: (1) only one scheduled FOMC meeting before July 1, (2) the Fed’s high bar for easing given its “greater confidence” standard, and (3) the rarity of intermeeting moves absent acute stress. Forecaster 3’s reference to CME FedWatch adds a useful market‑pricing cross‑check that generally implies low odds for June. I’m more cautious about two specifics: (a) the claim that the Fed has “paused its cutting cycle” is misleading—the Fed hasn’t started a cutting cycle; it has been on hold, which reinforces the high bar for a first cut. (b) Exact point estimates on unemployment and the March SEP inflation value should be treated carefully; the qualitative point (inflation progress has not been sufficiently convincing) is the key takeaway. Where I differ is on magnitude: given market pricing and major bank forecasts shifting to July or later, 20–25% seems a bit high for a June cut plus a very low probability of an intermeeting move.",
    "rationale": "Time is short and the bar is high. There is only one scheduled FOMC meeting before July 1, and intermeeting cuts are extremely rare without a material shock. Fed leadership has repeatedly stressed needing “greater confidence” that inflation is moving sustainably to 2%. Recent commentary and the research assistant’s summary indicate stronger‑than‑expected labor data and major institutions pushing first‑cut timing to July or later—some to even later in 2025—consistent with a low near‑term probability. Market‑implied odds (via FedWatch) reportedly shifted away from June as well. A June cut would likely require a string of clearly softer inflation prints and labor data and/or emergent financial stress, plus some pre‑meeting guidance—none of which is currently evident. Because the question resolves on announcement, not effective date, a June announcement is still the only realistic scheduled path; that keeps the probability above near‑zero. But with the Fed’s communication framework and the current data mix, holding remains the base case. Net: their arguments reinforce my prior view; I keep a low double‑digit probability and do not see a reason to move higher. I do not move lower because tail risks (shock, sharply soft inflation/labor, or explicit dovish signaling) remain possible ahead of the mid‑June meeting.",
