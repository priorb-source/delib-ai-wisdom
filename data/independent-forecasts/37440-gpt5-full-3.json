  "information": "Several bills concerning voter citizenship verification were considered in Florida's legislature. HB 831 would require state-issued IDs to indicate non-citizen status. HB 1381 would require voters to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport or birth certificate, for new or updated registrations. SB 1330 would require first-time voters to present similar documentation. The 2025 regular legislative session concluded without enacting these bills. A comprehensive bill containing similar provisions, CS/HB 1381, was withdrawn from consideration on May 3, 2025. An extended legislative session, constitutionally required to pass the state budget, began on May 12, 2025.\n\nFlorida's legislature is controlled by a Republican supermajority in both chambers. Governor Ron DeSantis has a history of supporting and signing legislation described as strengthening election integrity. In May 2025, DeSantis signed a law that creates new hurdles for the citizens' initiative process, including a ban on non-citizens and non-residents from gathering signatures for petitions. This followed the enactment of SB 7016 in April 2025, which also restricts ballot initiatives.\n\nThe push for expanded voter citizenship verification in Florida aligns with a broader national trend. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration nationwide, though it is unlikely to pass the Senate. Separately, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose stricter verification requirements. Other states have also advanced similar legislation; Wyoming passed a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote that is set to become effective on July 1, and a bill in Tennessee to create a citizenship verification portal for election workers has advanced in its state house.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (from May 6, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Legislature confines the May extended/special session to the state budget and related conforming bills, does not add election policy to the call, and no separate special session on elections is convened before July 1. Consequently, no new proof-of-citizenship requirements are enacted by the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Republican leadership and the Governor add voter-citizenship verification to the special session call (or fold key provisions into a budget-conforming/implementing bill), quickly pass a package such as elements of HB 831/HB 1381/SB 1330, and the Governor signs it in late May or June.",
    "rationale": "- Calendar and process: The 2025 regular session ended without passing HB 831, HB 1381, or SB 1330; CS/HB 1381 was withdrawn May 3. That makes the default path to passage a special session or inclusion in budget-related bills starting May 12. Special sessions in Florida can move fast, but adding non-budget election policy requires leadership will and scope expansion—nontrivial hurdles with less than two months left. This pushes the base case toward No.\n- Political alignment: Florida has a GOP supermajority and a Governor who has supported “election integrity” legislation. Recent actions tightening the initiative process show willingness to advance conservative election policy. National GOP pressure (e.g., SAVE Act passage in the U.S. House; a Trump EO) slightly raises odds Florida acts quickly to align symbolically.\n- Legal risk and optics: Documentary proof-of-citizenship at registration is litigious and faces NVRA-related preemption concerns, as seen in other states. That may explain why Florida leaders let these bills die in regular session. Measures like marking non-citizen status on IDs (HB 831) could still face pushback and might be seen as less urgent than budget priorities.\n- Net: With regular session over, the status quo is No. A Yes outcome requires active prioritization to reopen election policy in a constrained window. Florida’s leadership could do this, and draft text already exists, but absent clear signals it’s an uphill (though feasible) path.\n- Why not higher: Regular session failure, procedural constraints of a budget-focused extension, and litigation exposure make mid-cycle enactment before July 1 unlikely without explicit leadership moves.\n- Why not lower: GOP control, gubernatorial support, and national momentum mean a targeted special session or a late-session add-on is plausible; Florida has a track record of moving controversial policy quickly when prioritized.\n- What would move me up: Public statements from the Governor or presiding officers adding election integrity/citizenship verification to the special session call; a filed special-session bill or amendment reviving HB 831/HB 1381 provisions; committee notices calendaring such bills. That would raise the forecast to 60–80%.\n- What would move me down: Leadership indicating the special session will be budget-only, adjournment without any election policy, or credible reporting that the caucus will defer citizenship verification to a future session. That would drop the forecast to 5–10%.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral bills concerning voter citizenship verification were considered in Florida's legislature.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
