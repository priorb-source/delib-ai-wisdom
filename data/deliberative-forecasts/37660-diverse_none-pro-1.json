    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in strong agreement, with forecasts clustered between 25% and 35%. We all identify the central tension as being between the key positive signal (the license granted in August 2024) and the key negative signal (the ~10-month delay since that license with no visible progress and a short remaining timeframe). Forecaster 2 effectively framed the difference between licensing and operational readiness. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly compelling, offering a granular breakdown of potential last-mile hurdles (e.g., device approvals, billing, import logistics) and using relevant analogies from other markets like Indonesia and India. This added a valuable layer of specificity to my own reasoning.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 35%. After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am lowering my forecast slightly. The core reasoning is unchanged: the primary regulatory hurdle was cleared many months ago, which is a strong positive indicator. However, the lack of a launch in the ~10 months since is a powerful piece of negative evidence suggesting that the remaining operational, logistical, or final regulatory steps are non-trivial. Forecaster 3's detailed list of potential blockers (device type-approval, import logistics, billing systems) crystallized why such a delay might occur even after a headline license is granted. This extended delay, combined with the short remaining window of ~45 days, makes the status quo (not available) the most likely outcome. While a 'Yes' remains plausible because the final map update can happen very quickly once the backend work is complete, I am reducing my probability from 35% to 30% to better reflect the weight of the evidence from the protracted delay.",
