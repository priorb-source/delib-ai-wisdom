  "information": "Sam Altman and Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 as a non-profit foundation, with Musk providing significant initial funding. Musk left the organization in 2018 citing disagreements with Altman and the company's direction. After OpenAI was re-launched as a for-profit entity, Musk filed a lawsuit alleging a violation of the original non-profit principles. Their public rivalry has also included a hostile, unsolicited $97.4 billion takeover bid for OpenAI led by Musk, which Altman publicly dismissed, and reported competition for influence over U.S. government AI projects.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days until the event begins on June 16, 2025, and approximately 35 days until the final resolution deadline of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - they will not share a stage together",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Both Sam Altman and Elon Musk speak at the conference during separate time slots, avoiding any joint appearance. This is the most natural scheduling decision given their well-documented hostile relationship, with YC organizing the event to keep them apart to avoid controversy or awkwardness.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Y Combinator orchestrates a surprise joint panel, debate, or conversation between the two as a headline-grabbing moment. Alternatively, they mutually agree to some form of public dialogue to address their differences, possibly mediated by YC leadership. There could also be an unplanned moment where both end up on stage together during a group session or award ceremony.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Sam Altman and Elon Musk have an active, hostile relationship that includes ongoing litigation (Musk's lawsuit against OpenAI), a recent hostile takeover bid by Musk valued at $97.4 billion that Altman publicly dismissed, and competition for government AI influence. These are not merely historical grievances but current, active conflicts.\n\nWhile both are confirmed as headline speakers at the same two-day event, this alone doesn't make a joint stage appearance likely. Event organizers typically schedule speakers with known conflicts separately to avoid complications. Given the legal disputes and public animosity, neither party would likely agree to a joint appearance without significant motivation, and YC would be taking a substantial risk by forcing such an encounter.\n\nThe 20 days remaining until the event is insufficient time for meaningful reconciliation given the severity of their disputes. The hostile takeover bid is particularly recent and inflammatory, making any rapprochement extremely unlikely in this timeframe.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: (1) active legal disputes make professional joint appearances extraordinarily rare, (2) the hostile takeover attempt represents an ongoing aggressive action, (3) there's no indication in the available information that a joint appearance is planned or desired by either party, and (4) the status quo of conflict is well-established and recent.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: (1) both individuals will physically be at the same venue over two days, creating at least the possibility of encounter, (2) YC might see extraordinary value in orchestrating a surprise joint appearance for publicity, (3) there's a small chance of an unplanned joint moment during a group session, and (4) some minimal possibility of unexpected reconciliation exists.\n\nTo update higher, I would need: evidence of planned joint programming, signs of reconciliation between the parties, or statements indicating willingness to appear together. To update lower, I would need: evidence of explicit agreements to avoid each other, or escalation of their conflict.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Sam Altman and Elon Musk be on the stage together at YC AI Startup School?\n\nQuestion background:\nY Combinator is an American venture capital firm known for launching over 5,000 companies including Airbnb, Stripe, and Reddit. In 2025, Y Combinator announced AI Startup School, a conference in San Francisco held on June 16–17, aimed at 2,000 final-year students and recent graduates in computer science, artificial intelligence, and related fields.&#x20;\n\nY Combinator has announced that both Sam Altman and Elon Musk are among the headline speakers at the AI Startup School, but it is unknown whether they will appear on stage together at the same time.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as Yes if Sam Altman and Elon Musk share a stage together at YC AI Startup School after 7:59 AM, June 16, 2025, and before 00:00 AM, June 18, 2025. Otherwise, this question will resolve as No.\n\nSharing a stage is defined as both individuals being physically present on the same platform at the same time.&#x20;\n\nThis question will resolve according to a preponderance of evidence. If there is no clear evidence of this occurring before July 1, 2025, this question will resolve as No.\n\nAll times for this question are in Pacific Daylight Time (PDT).  &#x20;\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSam Altman and Elon Musk co-founded OpenAI in 2015 as a non-profit foundation, with Musk providing significant initial funding. Musk left the organization in 2018 citing disagreements with Altman and the company's direction. After OpenAI was re-launched as a for-profit entity, Musk filed a lawsuit alleging a violation of the original non-profit principles. Their public rivalry has also included a hostile, unsolicited $97.4 billion takeover bid for OpenAI led by Musk, which Altman publicly dismissed, and reported competition for influence over U.S. government AI projects.\n\nToday is 2025-05-27.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
