    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base case: starting around 39 destinations, a known pipeline of roughly five additions by July 1, and a sizable shortfall to >51 without a broad wave of resumptions. They add two useful emphases: (1) schedule-loading inertia—most additions that would operate by late June/July 1 should already be visible in OAG/flightsfrom by now; and (2) specificity on which absent hubs would need to return (DOH, KWI, JED/RUH, CAI, SAW, possibly BAH) to clear the threshold. They also note MEA seasonals as the main wild card but not sufficient alone. I didn’t see materially new positive evidence; if anything, the schedule-visibility point strengthens the No case.",
    "rationale": "Time left is ~6 weeks. From ~39 destinations in May, the confirmed/announced adds (SAS to CPH/ARN, Wizz AUH, MEA BCN, LOT WAW on July 1) plausibly lift BEY into the low-to-mid 40s by July 1. Surpassing 51 would require at least eight more unique airports beyond this pipeline. Many of the easiest increments (Qatar, Kuwait, Saudia, EgyptAir, Pegasus; perhaps Gulf Air) show no firm, public indications of resumption by July 1, and the broader context—soft demand, high insurance/risk premia, Q1 pax softness, and newly tightened security/bans—argues against a sudden surge. The point that flightsfrom/OAG would likely already reflect late-June ops further reduces the likelihood of a last-minute wave. MEA could still load a handful of seasonal Mediterranean points, but that’s unlikely to bridge the full gap. Given that the peers’ analyses reinforce my baseline and introduce no concrete upside signals, I’m keeping a low probability.",
