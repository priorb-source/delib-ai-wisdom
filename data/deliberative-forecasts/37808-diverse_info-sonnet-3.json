    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 both raised important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the active operational status - with DV-2026 results recently released and the status check portal remaining active until September 2026 - is strong evidence the program is fully operational and unlikely to see its primary pages removed in 6 weeks. This suggests higher confidence than my initial 89%. However, Forecaster 3 identified critical new information: a House bill from April 2025 to terminate the DV program. This shows active legislative effort that I hadn't accounted for. While Forecaster 3 correctly notes this would require passage through both chambers, presidential signature, and implementation within 6 weeks (which is tight), it does represent a non-trivial policy risk. Forecaster 3 also correctly invoked historical precedent - DV pages remained online during 2017-2020 despite Trump administration opposition, suggesting strong institutional inertia. Both forecasters appropriately identified the URL-specific technical risk, though this seems relatively small (2-3%). The key tension is between Forecaster 2's emphasis on operational continuity (98%) and Forecaster 3's incorporation of policy risks (82%).",
    "rationale": "Weighing the evidence: The active program status (DV-2026 results released, portal active until September 2026) is compelling evidence for continuity and pushes me toward Forecaster 2's view. The historical precedent from 2017-2020 reinforces that pages typically remain online even during periods of political opposition. However, the April 2025 House bill represents a real policy risk I underweighted initially. The 6-week timeline makes full legislative passage and implementation unlikely but not impossible, particularly given this administration's demonstrated willingness to act quickly on immigration matters. Breaking down the risks: Legislative elimination with rapid implementation (~4%), executive directive to remove page without formal program termination (~2%), technical/URL issues (~2-3%). This totals roughly 8-9% risk, suggesting 91-92% confidence. I'm updating slightly upward from my original 89% to 90%, giving weight to the strong operational status evidence from Forecaster 2 while acknowledging the policy risks identified by Forecaster 3. The active program operations and historical precedent provide stronger evidence than I initially credited, but the House bill and current administration's immigration actions prevent me from going as high as 98%.",
