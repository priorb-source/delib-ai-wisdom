    "review": "Both forecasters sharpened two points I underweighted: (1) the lack of credible pre-summit reporting or leaks as of late May is a negative signal when only ~5 weeks remain; and (2) optics/constraints around the New Development Bank and sanctions exposure make controversial candidates less likely and encourage consolidation. I also agree with their emphasis on unanimity with 10 members and Brazil/India’s more cautious posture. Their read that several partners (Algeria, Turkey, Vietnam) haven’t even confirmed participation lowers the near-term pool further. I still think host-country incentives and the active partner-to-member “pipeline” keep the probability appreciable, but I find their caution, especially on informational signals and the tight timeline, convincing. An additional bearish factor I’d add is India’s election calendar and cabinet formation squeezing negotiating bandwidth ahead of early July.",
    "rationale": "My prior was 45%, reflecting ongoing expansion momentum, a prepared partner queue, and Brazil’s incentive to deliver a headline. I’m updating downward on three considerations: (1) informational vacuum this close to the summit—no credible leaks or joint signaling from Brazil/India/China suggests no near-done deal; (2) unanimity among 10 members plus Brazil/India’s preference to consolidate after Indonesia’s January accession and amid Saudi Arabia’s unresolved invitation; (3) process/timing frictions, including India’s election and cabinet timing compressing pre-summit consensus building. A Yes path still exists—an upgrade of a relatively non-controversial partner (e.g., Malaysia, Thailand, possibly Kazakhstan or Nigeria) could be clinched at foreign ministers’ or sherpa level and announced at Rio or just before. But the base case is No: leadership emphasizes institutional deepening, partner framework operationalization, and financial cooperation, deferring further full invitations. Adjusting for these, I lower my estimate by 7 points.",
