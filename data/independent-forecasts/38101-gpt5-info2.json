  "information": "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's cabinet approval rating fell to a record low of 26% in a March 2025 Asahi newspaper poll. The 14-percentage-point drop followed a controversy involving the distribution of 100,000 yen gift vouchers to 15 lawmakers from the ruling party, which sparked public distrust. Although Ishiba apologized, he stated he used his own 'pocket money' as a sign of appreciation. All 15 lawmakers subsequently returned the vouchers. On the economic front, Ishiba is pursuing a growth-oriented economy driven by wage increases and investment, and has called for cooperation with the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren).",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes – recent patterns suggest Starmer’s approval is modestly higher than Ishiba’s, and weekly moving averages tend to be stable over short horizons.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ishiba’s approval rebounds into the low-30s while Starmer slips to the high-20s by late June (or they tie), driven by UK domestic troubles or a positive turn in Japan’s economic/political news.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Approvals remain roughly where they’ve been: Starmer around the low-/mid-30s and Ishiba in the mid-/upper-20s, or Starmer ticks up slightly while Ishiba remains depressed.",
    "rationale": "Evidence and status quo: The resolution source is Morning Consult’s weekly 7-day moving average. Japanese PM approval in national polling has been low: per the research assistant, Asahi had Ishiba’s cabinet approval at 26% in March following the gift-voucher controversy, consistent with historically low levels for recent Japanese PMs. Morning Consult’s series for Japan under Kishida was often in the 20s; Ishiba’s scandal makes a sustained rebound by early July less likely. In the UK, Starmer’s approval has not been stellar, but Morning Consult typically places UK PM approvals in the low-/mid-30s early in term. Other UK pollsters sometimes show him around high-20s to low-30s, but MC’s methodology can yield slightly different levels. With roughly one month left and MC using a smoothed weekly average, large swings are improbable without fresh shocks. That favors Starmer > Ishiba on July 1.\n\nWhy not higher: The gap is not enormous. Starmer could dip into the high-20s if negative UK stories (e.g., budget/tax, public services, migration) dominate June, while Ishiba could rebound on economic news (wage gains, yen stabilization) or political resets. A tie counts as No, adding downside tail risk.\n\nWhy not lower: The most recent clear signal we have is Ishiba in the mid-20s (Asahi, March), and Japan PM approvals tend to stay low absent major positive events. The voucher scandal’s effects may linger. With only ~4 weeks left and MC’s smoothing, a full crossover is less likely than continuation.\n\nUpdates that would move me up: A late-June MC update showing a clear gap (e.g., Starmer mid-30s vs Ishiba mid-20s), fresh negative headlines for Ishiba, or positive UK macro news (rate cuts, improving sentiment) without offsetting UK scandals.\n\nUpdates that would move me down: UK-specific shocks driving Starmer into the high-20s on MC, a visible Ishiba rebound into the low-30s (policy wins, successful messaging, improved economic sentiment), or an MC update showing the two essentially tied heading into July.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's cabinet approval rating fell to a record low of 26% in a March 2025 Asahi newspaper poll.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
