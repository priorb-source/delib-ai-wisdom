    "review": "New, useful points: (1) Morgan reportedly told Politico he’d wait and, if he runs, do a short campaign—implying no need to announce this month; (2) David Jolly’s June 5 entry trims any perceived Democratic vacuum; (3) an independent/third‑party path doesn’t impose a near‑term deadline. These all push down the near‑term hazard rate versus my prior. I find F2’s emphasis on Morgan’s stated timing and past non‑entries compelling, though 8% feels a bit too low given active party‑building and Morgan’s capacity to move fast. F3’s incorporation of Jolly’s entry is a good update; 27% still seems slightly high without concrete launch signals.",
    "rationale": "About 25 days remain. The status quo outcome is No unless we see clear pre‑announcement indicators. Morgan is actively building a centrist party, but his own mid‑May framing—to watch the field and, if he runs, to conduct a short campaign—reduces the incentive to announce before July 1. The sequencing logic (get party recognition/structure first, then declare) also points away from a June candidacy announcement. Jolly’s entry further eases any pressure to jump into the Democratic lane immediately. Upside risk remains because Morgan is wealthy, media‑savvy, and just floated a detailed blueprint; a surprise June splash is plausible if party paperwork, staffing, and branding coalesce quickly. Lacking concrete signals (event date, filings, staff hires, venue bookings), I lower my estimate from 30% to 18%. I would move up on credible June launch signals (press event scheduled, candidate filings/campaign account, senior staff hires, or formal party recognition paired with messaging about his own run); down if he reiterates a later decision timeline or focuses publicly on party‑building without tying it to a June candidacy announcement.",
