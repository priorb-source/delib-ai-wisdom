    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a persuasive political-economy frame: small, symbolic payments are high‑leverage for re‑engagement and arrears clearance, so a follow‑on disbursement would be rational before the next round of creditor interactions. Their mention of a February 2025 payment to foreign farmers (likely BIPA cases) is a useful additional data point suggesting a 2025 pattern of execution, not just rhetoric. I agree with the thrust, though I’d temper it by noting the April payment may have been timed to the Spring Meetings, reducing immediate pressure to deliver another within five weeks unless there’s another marquee forum (e.g., AfDB Annual Meetings in late May). \n\nForecaster 3’s point about a 2025 budget allocation (~$10m, with ~$6.9m left after the April $3.1m) is new and, if accurate, materially increases the feasibility of another tranche. Their caution around drought-driven fiscal stress and implementation friction is well‑taken. I think 35% is a bit low given the very recent activation and the government’s incentive to show momentum, but their constraints are real and argue against very high odds.\n\nNet: F2 shifts me upward via credible signaling incentives and evidence of multiple 2025 payments; F3’s budget detail also nudges up, while their constraint set keeps me from moving too far.",
    "rationale": "Time window: ~5.5 weeks from Apr 23 to Jun 1. Known facts: one $3.1m payment on/around Apr 9 under the GCD; public reaffirmation Apr 10; reported plan to settle 99% of the first batch via 10‑year bonds. Incremental arguments from peers: possible $10m 2025 budget for compensation and evidence of a February 2025 payment to foreign farmers, indicating operational capacity this year. \n\nDrivers toward Yes:\n- Signaling incentives tied to re‑engagement/arrears clearance; another small tranche (cash) or the delivery of the promised 10‑year bonds to the first‑batch claimants would be a cost‑effective proof of progress. AfDB Annual Meetings typically occur late May, providing a natural milestone to showcase an additional step.\n- If a specific 2025 budget allocation exists, it lowers the hurdle for at least one more modest disbursement before June.\n\nDrivers toward No:\n- Severe drought and fiscal/liquidity stress could crowd out near‑term cash outflows; even bonds require finalizing documentation, allocation mechanics, and potentially listing/settlement—processes that can slip past early June.\n- Bureaucratic and verification frictions (evidenced by inconsistent reporting on initial recipient counts) increase execution risk within a short window.\n\nNet assessment: The combination of fresh momentum, political incentives, and likely budgetary provision modestly outweighs execution and fiscal risks within a five‑week horizon. I originally held 42% on the expectation of slippage after a symbolic first payment; incorporating the peers’ points (especially the AfDB-timed signaling opportunity and budget allocation) leads me to a balanced, slightly higher stance.\n\nChange: Up from 42% to 50%.",
