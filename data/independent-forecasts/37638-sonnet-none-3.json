    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks remain until July 1, 2025. The outcome depends on whether the Texas legislature passes and the Governor signs a THC ban before that date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Currently, Texas allows the sale of certain THC products, particularly hemp-derived THC products like Delta-8 THC. If no new legislation is enacted by July 1, 2025, the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Texas legislative session ends around late May or early June 2025 without a comprehensive THC ban being passed and signed into law. Either the proposed Senate bill fails to gain traction, gets stuck in committee, faces opposition from the growing hemp industry, or doesn't reach the Governor's desk in time. The status quo of legal THC sales continues past July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Senate bill mentioned in the Beaumont Enterprise article gains momentum in the final weeks of the legislative session. It passes both chambers of the Texas legislature with enough support, and Governor Abbott signs it into law before July 1, 2025. The signing happens before implementation, satisfying the resolution criteria.",
    "rationale": "With only 6.5 weeks until the deadline and Texas being in its biennial legislative session (which typically ends in late May or early June), there is an extremely narrow window for passage. While the Beaumont Enterprise article indicates there is active legislative interest in banning THC, the research assistant provided no additional information about the bill's current status, committee progress, or likelihood of passage. Good forecasting emphasizes status quo outcomes, and the compressed timeline heavily favors no change. For a Yes outcome, the bill would need to be well-advanced in the legislative process already, have strong political support, pass both chambers, and be signed by the Governor - all within approximately 6 weeks. The base rate for controversial legislation passing in such a short window is low. However, I cannot assign near-zero probability because: (1) there is documented legislative activity on this issue, (2) we are currently in session, (3) Texas has historically taken conservative stances on drug policy, and (4) without detailed tracking data, I cannot rule out that a bill is already far along. My forecast would increase significantly if evidence emerged that a bill had already passed one chamber or was scheduled for imminent votes. It would decrease if the legislative session ended without passage or if strong industry opposition was documented.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
