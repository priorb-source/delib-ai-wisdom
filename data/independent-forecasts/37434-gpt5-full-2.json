  "information": "According to its latest financial reports, AquaBounty Technologies' cash reserves declined from $9.2 million at the end of 2023 to $230,000 as of December 31, 2024. The company reported a GAAP EPS of -$29.47 and revenue of $0.79 million for the fiscal year, a 68% year-over-year decrease. The company's former CFO stated, \"We do not have sufficient liquidity to continue operations,\" and management has issued a going-concern warning. The company's reported debt-to-equity ratio is 0.05.\n\nIn December 2024, AquaBounty announced it was ceasing fish farming activities, shutting down its last operational facility, and culling its remaining fish stock. The company laid off \"substantially all\" of its staff at the site. With production halted, there is no operating cash inflow. Management has acknowledged that its capital-raising efforts have been unsuccessful for over a year and has stated it is \"assessing alternatives\" for its Ohio facility.\n\nBy March 2025, AquaBounty's market capitalization had fallen to approximately $2.2 million, with its stock price dropping from a 52-week high of $3.05 to well below $1. The stock is trading below the NASDAQ compliance threshold, risking delisting. Despite the low price, institutional investor Epiq Partners LLC increased its holdings in the company by 423.5% in the fourth quarter. As of early 2025, institutional investors and hedge funds own 8.92% of the company's stock.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (through June 30, 2025, since filings on July 1 would not count)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty continues a bare‑bones corporate existence while pursuing an out‑of‑court asset sale of the Ohio facility or other strategic alternative (e.g., reverse merger), obtains a small bridge/insider loan, or simply stretches payables and drifts toward delisting—pushing any bankruptcy decision past July 1 or avoiding court altogether via non‑bankruptcy wind‑down.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The company hits a liquidity wall (e.g., unpaid vendors, lease obligations, professional fees) and the board authorizes a Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 filing to access the automatic stay and conduct an orderly sale (potentially a 363 sale), or a group of creditors files an involuntary petition before July 1.",
    "rationale": "What I know from the research assistant: Cash fell to roughly $0.23m by 12/31/24; operations were halted in December with staff largely laid off and fish stocks culled; revenues collapsed; management issued a going‑concern warning and said capital raising has been unsuccessful for over a year; the company is evaluating alternatives for its Ohio facility; market cap is about $2.2m as of March; debt-to-equity is low (~0.05). \n\nKey considerations:\n- Severe distress is clear (minimal cash, no operating inflows, going‑concern warning). That raises the chance of a bankruptcy filing in principle. However, leverage appears low, which reduces immediate creditor pressure and makes an out‑of‑court wind‑down or asset sale more feasible than for a heavily indebted peer. \n- Timing matters: we’re already at May 5, and the company ceased operations months ago without filing. That persistence suggests they either cut burn to a minimal level, found small sources of cash, or are actively trying to sell assets without court protection. The window to July 1 is short (~56 days). Even if bankruptcy is ultimately likely, it may occur after the deadline. \n- Strategic alternatives: Selling the Ohio asset out of court, pursuing a reverse merger, or obtaining a small bridge/insider financing could postpone or avert a filing in the near term. Conversely, if a sale process stalls and cash is depleted for public-company and caretaker costs (audit, legal, facility security), a filing could become necessary in June. \n- Involuntary bankruptcy risk exists but is mitigated by likely small and diffuse unsecured creditor base and low secured debt; absent a concentrated creditor push, an involuntary petition before July is less likely. \n\nWhy not higher: If a filing were imminent, it likely would have happened around the December shutdown or by the 10‑K filing in late March. Low leverage gives them more scope to delay. The short remaining window makes a pre‑July filing less than even odds. \n\nWhy not lower: Liquidity is extremely tight, operations are shut, and capital markets access appears poor. If caretaker costs or creditor pressure become unmanageable, a Chapter 11/7 filing in June is plausible. \n\nSignals to update:\n- Up: 8‑K announcing retention of restructuring counsel/bankers for a court process, defaults/forbearances, missed payroll/benefits, notices of acceleration, or disclosure of near‑term liquidity shortfall without financing. \n- Down: Signed/closed asset sale providing runway, definitive financing (even small), a binding merger/reverse‑merger agreement that funds liabilities, or explicit board guidance toward non‑bankruptcy dissolution.\n\nOverall, I put extra weight on the status quo—no filing yet despite months of distress—and the short time left, yielding a modest but material probability of a filing before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill AquaBounty Technologies file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[AquaBounty Technologies Announces Full Year 2024 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603978/000160397825000012/aqb-20250327xex99_1.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to its latest financial reports, AquaBounty Technologies' cash reserves declined from $9.2 million at the end of 2023 to $230,000 as of December 31, 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
