  "information": "As of the last filing for Q4 2024, Berkshire Hathaway held approximately 10.7 million shares of Amazon. For 10 consecutive quarters, the company has been a net seller of equities. In Q1 2025, Berkshire increased its cash reserves to a record of approximately $348 billion. During that same quarter, the company's operating earnings declined by 14.1%, and no stock repurchases were made. New investments were focused on the energy sector and Japanese trading firms.\n\nWarren Buffett has announced his intention to step down as CEO by the end of 2025, with Greg Abel set to succeed him. Following the announcement, a Stocktwits poll indicated that 46% of retail investors still view Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term 'buy', and retail sentiment on the stock was described as 'extremely bullish'. UBS analysts stated that the company's structural advantages, including its permanent capital and information collection capabilities, are not expected to be significantly reduced by the leadership change.\n\nAnalysts from sources including NASDAQ and The Motley Fool have highlighted Amazon's growth potential, particularly through its cloud infrastructure service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is reportedly growing by a high-teens percentage year-over-year. In May 2025, both JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley raised their target price for Amazon stock to $230.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one week. The 13F filing for the quarter ending March 31, 2025, is typically filed up to 45 days after the quarter's end, making the deadline around May 15, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Berkshire Hathaway makes no changes to its Amazon holdings from the previous quarter. The position remains at approximately 10.7 million shares, which is above the 10,000,000 share threshold, resulting in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Continuing its broader strategy of reducing equity exposure and building cash reserves, Berkshire Hathaway sells at least 700,001 shares of Amazon during Q1 2025. This action reduces its total holdings to or below the 10,000,000 share threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite being a net seller of equities overall, Berkshire's portfolio managers maintain their conviction in Amazon's long-term value, particularly in its AWS division. They either hold the position steady, add to it, or trim it by less than 700,001 shares, ensuring the total holding remains above 10,000,000 shares.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards 'Yes' primarily due to the status quo. Berkshire Hathaway's last reported position was 10.7 million shares, providing a 700,000 share buffer before the outcome flips to 'No'. For the outcome to be 'No', Berkshire would need to have actively sold more than 6.5% of its stake in a single quarter. While not impossible, it is a significant trim.\n\nThe primary evidence against this forecast is Berkshire's well-established trend of being a net seller of equities for 10 consecutive quarters, coupled with its record cash hoard of $348 billion and lack of share repurchases in Q1 2025. This indicates a general bearishness on market valuations and a clear preference for liquidity. This trend is the main reason my probability is not higher; it makes a reduction in their Amazon position plausible as part of this broader de-risking strategy.\n\nHowever, there are strong counter-arguments. Amazon's fundamentals are robust, with analysts from JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley raising price targets in May 2025, driven by high-teens growth in AWS. The investment, likely initiated by portfolio managers Todd Combs or Ted Weschler rather than Warren Buffett, may be viewed as a core long-term holding with significant growth potential that differentiates it from other positions that Berkshire has trimmed. Given the positive outlook for the company, managers might be reluctant to sell a significant stake. \n\nTherefore, while the macroeconomic stance of Berkshire points towards selling, the specific company fundamentals of Amazon and the existing buffer make it more probable that the position remained above the 10 million share threshold. I would lower my forecast if specific news emerged about Berkshire souring on the tech sector's valuation. Conversely, I would raise my forecast if there were signs of Berkshire selectively adding to what it considers high-quality growth companies despite its cautious overall stance.",
