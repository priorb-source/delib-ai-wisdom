  "information": "Kalshi, a prediction market platform regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has been actively offering daily MLB markets since April 17, 2025. Sports-related contracts represent a significant portion of its business, accounting for over 80% of weekend trading volume. The company has handled substantial trading activity, including $27 million for the Super Bowl and $500 million for the March Madness basketball tournament. Kalshi has also filed with the CFTC to expand its offerings to include single-game predictions.\n\nThe platform faces legal and regulatory challenges. A judge in Nevada is expected to rule quickly on a case involving Kalshi's prediction markets. Major sports leagues have voiced concerns; the NBA has cited 'substantial integrity risks' due to a perceived lack of regulatory oversight compared to traditional sportsbooks, and Major League Baseball has highlighted the need for consumer protections equivalent to state-level regulations. In response, Kalshi has announced plans to enhance user protections, including voluntary opt-outs, self-imposed trading breaks, and deposit caps.\n\nJune is part of the MLB regular season, during which games are scheduled on nearly every calendar day. The MLB All-Star Game is scheduled for July 2025. Other baseball-related events in late June include the Liga Mexicana de Béisbol (LMB) All-Star Game, set to take place from June 27 to 29, 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 30 days (through June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Kalshi continues posting at least one MLB game market every calendar day, as it has since mid-April 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A regulatory or legal action (e.g., a TRO/injunction or CFTC directive) forces Kalshi to pause sports or MLB markets for even a single day in June; or an operational lapse/outage results in no MLB game market being posted on a given day.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi maintains its current cadence of daily MLB listings throughout June; if needed, it geoblocks specific jurisdictions (e.g., Nevada) without suspending nationwide MLB markets.",
    "rationale": "Status quo: Kalshi has been offering daily MLB markets since Apr 17, 2025, and sports now drive a large share of volume (80%+ of weekend trading), creating strong commercial incentives to maintain uninterrupted daily MLB listings. June is squarely in the MLB regular season, with games effectively every day. These facts push heavily toward “Yes.”\nHeadwinds: Legal/regulatory uncertainty remains. A Nevada judge intends to move quickly on a case involving Kalshi’s prediction markets, and major leagues (NBA/MLB) have raised integrity and consumer-protection concerns. Although such actions most likely lead to jurisdiction-specific remedies (e.g., Nevada geoblocking) rather than a nationwide shutdown, there is a non-trivial tail risk of a broader pause if a federal regulator (CFTC) intervenes or Kalshi voluntarily suspends to comply with new guidance. Operational risk (a day with no listings due to an oversight or outage) is low but not zero across 30 consecutive days.\nWhy not higher: The main drag on raising above the low-90s is regulatory risk concentrated in early June (timing of court action or potential CFTC steps) plus small operational risk that a single day is missed. Why not lower: Kalshi has already run daily baseball markets for ~6 weeks without interruption, has demonstrated capacity during high-volume events (Super Bowl, March Madness), and has publicly signaled enhanced user protections—suggesting adaptation rather than retreat. A Nevada ruling is unlikely to shut down nationwide MLB markets; more plausibly it results in targeted geoblocking.\nWhat would move me up: Confirmation that (1) the Nevada ruling does not require nationwide suspension, (2) no CFTC enforcement/action limiting single-game sports in June, and (3) Kalshi continues posting MLB markets daily through the first week of June without gaps. What would move me down: Any credible report of an injunction/TRO or CFTC directive impacting sports nationwide, a Kalshi announcement pausing sports, payment/processing disruption, or evidence of a missed daily MLB listing.",
