  "information": "As of March 2025, Beyond Meat had $116 million in cash on hand. The company's liabilities included $1.15 billion in convertible bonds maturing in 2027, which were reported to be trading at 17 cents on the dollar. On May 7, 2025, the company announced it had secured a new $100 million senior secured financing facility. The loan has an initial term of 4.75 years with an interest rate of 12% until February 2030, payable in kind, meaning interest is added to the loan's principal instead of being paid in cash during this period.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The company continues to operate without filing for bankruptcy protection.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Beyond Meat uses its existing cash and the newly secured $100 million financing facility to fund its operations and turnaround strategy, successfully navigating the period until July 1, 2025, without any need to file for bankruptcy.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite the new financing, an unforeseen and severe event occurs, such as a catastrophic product recall, the discovery of fraud, or an immediate and drastic acceleration in cash burn that breaches covenants on its new loan, forcing the company into a sudden bankruptcy filing to protect its assets from creditors.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the announcement on May 7, 2025, that Beyond Meat secured a new $100 million senior secured financing facility. This new capital, on top of its reported $116 million in cash (as of March 2025), provides a significant liquidity runway that almost certainly allows the company to continue operations well beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline. The company's fourth-quarter 2024 loss from operations of nearly $38 million suggests a monthly cash burn of around $13 million. With over $200 million in available liquidity and less than two months until the resolution date, they have more than sufficient cash to cover near-term operational needs. The structure of the new loan, with its interest being payable-in-kind, further preserves cash in the short term. While the company faces significant long-term challenges, particularly the $1.15 billion in convertible bonds due in 2027, the new financing is a deliberate action to bridge the company through its current difficulties and provides a strong signal that an imminent bankruptcy filing is not planned or expected.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 5% because Beyond Meat is still a financially distressed company. The very need for expensive secured financing indicates its precarious position. The low trading price of its bonds (17 cents on the dollar) reflects deep market skepticism about its long-term viability. An unexpected event, such as a major food safety crisis or a violation of covenants on their new loan, could still trigger a rapid collapse.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the new financing was explicitly obtained to avoid a near-term bankruptcy. It would be highly illogical for the company and its new lenders to arrange this facility only for a bankruptcy filing to occur within the subsequent seven weeks. The new capital provides a clear buffer for at least several quarters.\n\nI would increase my probability if news emerged that the financing deal had fallen through, if a major scandal or product recall occurred, or if a key executive resigned unexpectedly. I would decrease my probability if the company announced a significant strategic partnership or an equity infusion that further shored up its balance sheet.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beyond Meat file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeyond Meat has had several years of losses and in the most recent quarter it [posted](https://investors.beyondmeat.com/news-releases/news-release-details/beyond-meatr-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2024-financial) a loss from operations of almost $38 million.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Beyond Meat, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of March 2025, Beyond Meat had $116 million in cash on hand.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
