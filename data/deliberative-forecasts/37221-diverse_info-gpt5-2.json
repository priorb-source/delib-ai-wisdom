    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds the most decision-relevant new information: a reported Bloomberg/Reuters consensus of 2.1% for April and a March print at 2.2%. Given Trading Economics resolves on a one-decimal display, this implies we need a displayed 2.3% to resolve Yes, so a 2.1% consensus materially lowers the tail probability of a Yes. That’s a strong, specific datapoint I hadn’t incorporated. Forecaster 3’s macro case (weak PMIs, easing wages, softer food, negative energy YoY) is directionally consistent with disinflation but feels somewhat generic and may be stale on energy (base effects are fading and oil has not been soft). Both forecasters underweight the late-Easter April services effect (airfares/package holidays) that can push the headline up, but the consensus likely already bakes some of that in. Overall, I find Forecaster 2’s argument most convincing due to the concrete consensus figure and the recent drift to 2.2%.",
    "rationale": "I’m revising down meaningfully. My prior 64% overweighted the late Easter/services boost and underweighted two key factors: (1) the discrete rounding constraint (we effectively need 2.3% on Trading Economics), and (2) the reported economist consensus of 2.1% for April. If the true mean expectation is ~2.1% with typical month-to-month forecast error in the ~0.1–0.2 pp range, the chance of hitting 2.3%+ is modest. Upside risks remain: Easter timing can lift services, wages are still firm enough to limit downside, and energy base effects are less disinflationary than in 2023–24. But the base case favors a 2.0–2.2% print, which would resolve No. I’m therefore moving from 64% to 35%. I would move back up if national flashes (Germany/Spain/France/Italy) surprise to the upside on Apr 29–30 or if energy/airfares show unusual strength in April; I’d move down further if those national prints skew soft.",
