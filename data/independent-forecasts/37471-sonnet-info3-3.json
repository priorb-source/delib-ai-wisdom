  "information": "According to the US Census Bureau, housing starts declined by 14.2% month-over-month in March 2025 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 940,000 units. In the same month, building permits for single-family homes decreased by 2% month-over-month. Builder confidence, as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index (HMI), was reported to be around 42.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks. May 2025 data from FRED is typically released in late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The inventory was at 500,000 units in February 2025. Maintaining the recent trend would likely result in some increase, but reaching 550,000 by May (a 10% increase in just 3 months) represents an acceleration beyond the status quo trajectory.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Housing starts and permits continue declining through spring 2025, reflecting weak builder confidence (HMI at 42). The pipeline of homes under construction slows, and sales improve slightly, preventing inventory from accumulating rapidly. The May figure remains in the 510,000-540,000 range.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite declining new starts, the substantial pipeline of homes already under construction gets completed and added to inventory. Simultaneously, buyer demand remains weak due to elevated mortgage rates or economic uncertainty, causing completed homes to sit unsold. The combination of pipeline completions plus slow absorption pushes inventory above 550,000.",
    "rationale": "The baseline is 500,000 units in February 2025, representing a historic high outside the 2006 bubble period. Reaching 550,000 by May requires a 50,000 unit (10%) increase over three months, or roughly 17,000 units per month. While the long-term trend shows tripling over 13 years, the March 2025 data presents countervailing signals: housing starts dropped 14.2%, permits declined 2%, and builder confidence sits at a weak 42. These indicators suggest builders are pulling back. However, there's typically a 6-12 month lag between starts and completion, meaning homes begun in late 2024/early 2025 will still enter inventory. The critical factor is whether sales velocity can absorb these completions. If demand remains soft while the construction pipeline continues delivering, inventory could continue rising despite new starts declining. I estimate roughly 40% probability because: (1) the strong multi-year upward trend in inventory supports continued growth, (2) the construction pipeline lag means near-term completions are largely predetermined, and (3) weak builder sentiment suggests soft demand that could cause inventory accumulation. However, I'm not higher because 10% growth in 3 months is aggressive and recent data shows clear deceleration signals. I would revise upward if March/April preliminary data showed inventory still growing rapidly despite the starts decline, or if sales data showed significant weakening. I would revise downward if early indicators showed inventory stabilizing or sales improving.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of new single family homes for sale in the US exceed 550 thousand in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Kobeissi Letter](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1912142359577403619): \"BREAKING: The number of new single-family homes for sale has surged to 500,000 in February, the highest since November 2007.\n\nThe number of new homes on the market has more than TRIPLED over the last 13 years, from a low of 142,000.\n\nExcluding the 2006 housing bubble this is, by far, the largest supply of new homes in history.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of New One Family Homes for Sale in the United States reported for May 2025 is greater than 550 thousand, according to what is presented by [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HNFSEPUSSA).\n\nEnsure units is set to \"Thousands of Units, Seasonally Adjusted\" and frequency is set to \"Monthly, End of Month\". Question resolves based on the number presented by FRED, and no other resolution source will be considered.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, housing starts declined by 14.2% month-over-month in March 2025 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 940,000 units. In the same month, building permits for single-family homes decreased by 2% month-over-month. Builder confidence, as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index (HMI), was reported to be around 42.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
