    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I hadn't fully considered. Most notably, Forecaster 2 raises the SAFE for America Act - active legislation addressing the Diversity Visa program. This is significant because if Congress is already pursuing this issue, the Trump administration would likely prefer permanent legislative change over a potentially reversible executive action. This substantially reduces the likelihood of executive action. Forecaster 3 provides helpful specificity about the initial flurry of immigration executive orders (62 by mid-February) and both emphasize that 4+ months have passed without action on this specific program despite intense immigration activity. This pattern is highly informative. Both forecasters also effectively highlight the restrictive nature of requiring the exact phrase 'Diversity Visa' - an executive action might reference visa programs more generally without using those precise words. Forecaster 2's point about Trump's historical immigration priorities (border security, travel restrictions, asylum) rather than specific visa lottery programs is also well-taken. However, I note both forecasters independently arrived at 28%, and I'm not convinced the evidence supports moving up from my 20% forecast. The SAFE for America Act point actually argues for an even lower probability than any of us initially assessed.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I find the legislative alternative (SAFE for America Act) to be the most significant new information. This provides the Trump administration with a preferred pathway that doesn't require spending limited executive action resources on a relatively small program. The 4-month pattern of inaction despite 60+ immigration-related executive orders is highly informative - if the Diversity Visa was a priority for executive action, it likely would have appeared in the initial wave. The exact wording requirement adds additional friction. However, I acknowledge the 42 days remaining is meaningful time, and Trump's demonstrated capacity for rapid action on immigration matters cannot be dismissed. The convergence of both forecasters at 28% gives me pause about my initial 20%, but the legislative alternative point actually argues for staying lower rather than moving higher. I'll move up slightly to account for the genuine uncertainty in the remaining timeframe and Trump's unpredictability, but the fundamental calculus - 4 months of inaction, active legislation, focus on other priorities, restrictive wording requirement - still points to this being unlikely.",
