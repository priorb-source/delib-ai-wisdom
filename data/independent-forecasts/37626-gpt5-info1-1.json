  "information": "Historical price data for bananas in the U.S. shows relative stability. The price was reported as 63 cents per pound in 2022, 62.1 cents in January 2025, and 62.5 cents in March 2025. An analysis of price trends between 2005 and 2025 indicates that banana prices experienced a modest increase of 23.5%, one of the smallest increases compared to other consumer goods like beef (136%) and chicken (94%) over the same period.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 4 weeks (BLS will publish May 2025 average price data in mid-June 2025 alongside the CPI release).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — recent BLS prints in early 2025 (e.g., 62.1¢ in Jan, 62.5¢ in Mar) are below 63¢, and bananas tend to move only a couple of tenths of a cent month to month.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A modest uptick pushes the reported May value to 63.0¢ or higher, driven by higher shipping/port costs, temporary supply tightness from Latin America, or simply statistical/rounding effects landing exactly at 0.630.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Prices remain in their recent band (roughly 62.1–62.5¢), with no new supply shocks or cost pass-throughs in May, leading to a reported value like 0.624–0.629.",
    "rationale": "I’m forecasting the probability that the BLS average price for bananas (APU0000711211) reported for May 2025 will be under $0.6300. The research assistant notes bananas have been unusually stable over time, with 63.0¢ in 2022, 62.1¢ in Jan 2025, and 62.5¢ in Mar 2025. This stability and the most recent observations being below 63¢ point to a status-quo outcome of “Yes.” Month-to-month movements in this series are usually small (on the order of 0.1–0.5¢), and there’s no clear evidence of a sharp, imminent shock specific to May.\n\nReasons the forecast isn’t higher: the threshold is tight. A move of only ~0.5–1.0¢ could push the reported value to 0.630, which would resolve as No because the criterion is strictly “under $0.6300.” Rounding risk matters near the threshold: an underlying value near 0.6295 could be reported as 0.630. The Quartz article flags upward pressure from fees and potential cost pass-throughs; if those are materializing with a lag, they could lift May’s figure by a few tenths of a cent.\n\nReasons the forecast isn’t lower: the most recent prints available (Jan–Mar) are already under 63¢, bananas historically show low volatility and weak seasonality, and there’s no widely reported acute supply disruption for May. With only about a month until publication, large deviations are unlikely.\n\nWhat would change my view:\n- Upward: If the April 2025 BLS banana price (due with the May 14 CPI release) comes in at 0.629–0.631, I’d move closer to 50–60% due to proximity and rounding risk; ≥0.631 would push me closer to 40–50%.\n- Downward (more confident in Yes): If April prints ≤0.626, I’d raise to ~75–80%. Confirmation of easing freight/port pressures would also nudge higher.\n- Any credible report of a May-specific supply or logistics disruption would lower the probability.\n\nNetting these, I put extra weight on the status quo and recent data while respecting the tight threshold and rounding risk.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the price of bananas reported by the US BLS for May 2025 be under 63 cents a pound?\n\nQuestion background:\nQuartz: [Move over, eggs – bananas are the next victim](https://qz.com/bananas-dole-price-hikes-inflation-port-fees-trump-tari-1851772583)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
