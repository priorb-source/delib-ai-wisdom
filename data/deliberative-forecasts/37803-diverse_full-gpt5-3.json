    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same core drivers I used: explicit ideological opposition, concrete dismantling actions, long prior downtime, short runway to July 1, and historical precedent that such pages stay down. They add a couple of mechanisms I didn’t explicitly weigh: expedited legal challenges or a court order, and the possibility of bipartisan Senate pressure. I agree those are theoretically pathways but low-probability within ~6 weeks. I find their reasoning largely convincing and broadly aligned; the main difference is calibration—Forecaster 2 at 5% and Forecaster 3 at 8%. Their arguments nudge me slightly lower, mainly by reinforcing how little time remains for a reversal and how restoration would contradict the administration’s messaging, reducing the plausibility of even a placeholder page going up quickly.",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution is ~6 weeks, the portal has been down since Jan 21, and current DoD leadership is actively rolling back climate initiatives and messaging. There is no announced plan to restore climate.mil, funding has been cut, and precedent from the prior Trump administration suggests long-duration removals. A Yes outcome requires a deliberate choice to bring back climate.mil (even as a placeholder/redirect), which runs counter to stated priorities and offers limited benefit to the administration. Potential upside catalysts—June hearings, a symbolic placeholder to defuse criticism, or an unexpected legal directive—exist but appear unlikely to materialize and execute before July 1. Given the alignment with the other forecasters’ reasoning and the short timeline, I’m trimming my estimate from 10% to 8%. I would move up on any technical signals (DNS/HTTP changes), DoD statements about archiving/restoring the portal, or credible reporting that hearings will compel restoration. I would move down on explicit confirmation of permanent decommissioning or further public commitments to remove climate web content.",
