    "review": "All three forecasts converge on 8-12%, which strongly validates the analytical approach. Forecaster 2's reasoning mirrors mine closely, settling at 10% using the same base rate logic. Forecaster 3 provides the most sophisticated analysis with a Poisson process framing: with λ = 1-2 South American pilot reports per year, the probability of at least one in June is 8-15%, with midpoint around 11-12%. This mathematical rigor is compelling. Forecaster 3 also raises an important consideration about posting delays, though notes this is mitigated by the 'on or after July 1' resolution language allowing Metaculus flexibility in checking. The alternative framing (global pilot reports × SA share) yields similar results. No forecaster presented fundamentally new evidence, but Forecaster 3's statistical methodology is more precise than my more intuitive approach. The three-way convergence in a narrow range increases my confidence we've correctly identified the probability space.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 8% forecast was at the conservative end of the justified range. The Poisson process framing with λ ≈ 1-2 per year mathematically supports 8-15% for a single month, with the midpoint around 11-12%. Given that: (1) documented precedent confirms the reporting pathway exists and is used occasionally (Brazil Dec 2024, Chile Feb 2023), (2) the structural barriers I identified are real but not absolute, and (3) three independent analyses converge on 8-12%, I should move toward the center of this range rather than remain at the low end. The posting delay concern is valid but partially mitigated by the resolution allowing checks 'on or after July 1.' My updated forecast of 10% represents: the lower end of the Poisson-derived probability for λ=1 (≈8%) slightly adjusted upward to account for the possibility that λ is closer to 1.5 or 2, balanced against the structural barriers of NUFORC being US-based and English-only. This keeps me appropriately conservative while acknowledging the mathematical and empirical support for a low-double-digit probability.",
