  "information": "Former FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service after posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to spell '86 47'. The number '86' can be slang for 'kill' or 'remove,' and Donald Trump is the 47th president. Following the post, Comey was interviewed by the Secret Service but was not arrested. He later deleted the post, stating, 'I didn't realize that some people associate these numbers with violence. I oppose all forms of violence, so I deleted the post.' Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed the investigation.\n\nSeveral public figures have called for legal action against James Comey. General Michael Flynn predicted that Comey will be indicted. The InfoWars platform cited alleged Department of Justice sources claiming Comey's indictment is 'imminent.' Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett stated that Comey could be prosecuted for the post. Current FBI Director Chris Wray reported that the agency has faced a surge in threats against Donald Trump following Comey's post, requiring agents to be diverted from other cases.\n\nAs of late May 2025, no charges have been filed against James Comey, nor have any warrants or subpoenas been issued in relation to the social media post. Legal experts suggest a prosecution faces significant hurdles due to First Amendment protections and a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that requires prosecutors to prove a subjective intent to threaten. Historically, arresting former FBI directors or other ex-cabinet-level officials is extremely rare in the United States.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No arrest - Comey remains free without charges filed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The investigation continues through June but prosecutors determine they cannot overcome First Amendment protections and the high legal bar set by the 2023 Supreme Court ruling requiring proof of subjective intent to threaten. No charges are filed, and the matter remains a political controversy without legal consequences.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Political pressure from the Trump administration accelerates the investigation. Federal prosecutors file charges in mid-June arguing the post constituted a threat, an arrest warrant is issued, and Comey is taken into custody before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors no arrest. With only 32 days remaining, significant legal obstacles stand in the way. Key factors weighing against arrest: (1) Strong First Amendment protections for speech, (2) The 2023 Supreme Court ruling requiring prosecutors to prove subjective intent to threaten - a high bar, (3) As of late May, no charges, warrants, or subpoenas have been issued despite the investigation being active for weeks, (4) Legal experts explicitly state prosecution faces 'significant hurdles,' (5) Historical precedent - arresting former FBI directors or cabinet-level officials is extremely rare in US history, (6) Comey deleted the post and clarified his intent, undermining claims of threatening behavior. The timeline from investigation to arrest typically requires: completing investigation, deciding to prosecute, obtaining indictment/filing charges, issuing warrant, and executing arrest - difficult to accomplish in 32 days for a case with constitutional challenges. However, probability is not zero because: there is an active federal investigation, political motivation exists in the Trump administration, and some public figures are calling for prosecution. The claims from InfoWars about 'imminent indictment' should be heavily discounted given reliability concerns. For my forecast to move higher, I would need to see: actual charges filed, a warrant issued, or credible reporting that prosecution is proceeding despite legal obstacles. For my forecast to move lower: explicit statements that the investigation is closing without charges, or legal analysis showing the case is even weaker than currently understood.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFormer FBI Director James Comey is under investigation by the Department of Homeland Security and the Secret Service after posting a photo on Instagram showing seashells arranged to spell '86 47'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
