    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-7 weeks. The FATF June 2025 Plenary typically occurs in mid-to-late June, with the updated list published shortly after the meeting concludes.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - The black list would remain unchanged with the same three jurisdictions: North Korea, Myanmar, and Iran.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FATF Plenary reviews all jurisdictions in June 2025 and determines that no changes are warranted. North Korea, Myanmar, and Iran remain on the black list due to continued deficiencies, and no other jurisdictions have deteriorated sufficiently to warrant black listing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Either: (1) A country currently on the grey list is escalated to the black list due to sustained non-compliance, OR (2) One of the three current black list countries (most plausibly Iran) is removed following significant reforms and compliance improvements, OR (3) Myanmar or North Korea is removed due to political changes or improved cooperation.",
    "rationale": "The FATF black list is extremely stable and changes infrequently. Historical patterns show that modifications occur perhaps once every 1-3 years on average across the three annual plenary meetings, suggesting each individual meeting has a low probability of producing changes. Strong status quo factors favor NO: (1) North Korea has been blacklisted for years with no cooperation - removal is virtually impossible; (2) Myanmar's political instability following the military coup makes removal unlikely; (3) Iran remains non-compliant on multiple measures despite some past progress. For additions, escalation from grey to black list is rare and typically requires extended non-compliance that would likely already be well-documented. The research assistant provided no information suggesting imminent changes. The one-month timeframe is too short for countries to implement reforms sufficient for removal. However, I'm not forecasting lower than 20% because: FATF processes are not fully transparent, geopolitical developments could surprise, and Iran has occasionally shown willingness to engage on these issues. I would update higher with credible reports of specific countries under consideration for listing changes, or evidence of major compliance improvements. I would update lower with explicit FATF statements indicating no anticipated changes or confirmation of continued serious deficiencies in all three current jurisdictions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"black list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Financial Action Task Force blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force_blacklist)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action\" list, which at the time of this question consists of North Korea, Myanmar and Iran. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
