    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until July 1, 2025), or earlier if a qualifying bill is enacted sooner.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (Florida does not change voter citizenship verification requirements).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 2025 regular session adjourns without passing any bill that requires voters to provide new/documentary proof of citizenship, and no special session is called (or, if called, no such bill passes before July 1).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A bill like HB 831 (or a companion/merged vehicle) passes both chambers in the 2025 session and is enacted (signed or allowed to become law) before July 1, adding a requirement that some set of voters (e.g., first-time registrants or vote-by-mail applicants) must provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship beyond current practice.",
    "rationale": "- Legislative timing and process: Florida’s regular session in odd-numbered years typically runs roughly March–early May. As of May 6, 2025, the regular session is likely at or just after adjournment. If a bill didn’t pass by Sine Die, the remaining path is a governor-called special session, which is possible but not routine for a single election-administration change. If a bill did pass, enactment before July 1 is highly likely (DeSantis would sign, and in Florida a bill can also become law without signature if not vetoed within the constitutional window). Thus, the hinge is whether a qualifying bill cleared both chambers in the regular session.\n- Political alignment: Florida is a Republican trifecta with a governor historically supportive of tightening election rules. That raises the baseline chance that such legislation would be prioritized and passed.\n- Legal/administrative friction: Requiring voters to provide documentary proof of citizenship intersects with federal constraints (e.g., NVRA for federal elections) and creates administrative burdens (potential need for dual ballots or carve-outs). Florida leaders may opt for back-end verification (database checks, interagency data sharing) rather than imposing new documentation duties on voters, which would not meet this question’s criterion. That dampens the odds that a bill explicitly requiring voters to provide new proof would be enacted.\n- Status quo bias: Most proposed election-law tightenings in multiple states do not become law each session, or they are narrowed to avoid litigation. Given we are at or just past the end of the regular session, the default outcome is that no qualifying bill was enacted; moving off that default requires evidence of passage or a special session.\n- Research assistant info: None provided beyond the example bill, so I place additional weight on structural factors (session timing, partisan control, legal constraints) rather than event-specific reporting.\n- Why not higher: Legal risk and administrative complexity of documentary proof requirements; the likelihood that, if leadership perceived litigation risk, they softened the bill away from requiring voter-provided proof. Also, the regular session window is likely closed.\n- Why not lower: Strong GOP control and gubernatorial support; national salience of the issue; if a bill did pass in late session, enactment before July 1 is very plausible.\n- What would change my view:\n  - Upward: Confirmation that HB 831 (or a companion) passed both chambers; announcement of a special session on election integrity; public statements from legislative leaders prioritizing proof-of-citizenship requirements this year.\n  - Downward: Reports that the bill died in committee or on the calendar; leadership statements deferring the issue; special-session calls focused on unrelated topics.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
