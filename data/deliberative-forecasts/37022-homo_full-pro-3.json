    "review": "My initial analysis and those of the other two forecasters are highly aligned in methodology and the core evidence considered. All three of us identified the same primary drivers for the debt increase in March 2025: the IMF tranche (~16B UAH), domestic bond issuance (~26B UAH), and the currency depreciation effect (~10B UAH). We all calculated a likely total increase of approximately 52 billion UAH, which provides a substantial buffer of over 20 billion UAH above the 31 billion UAH increase required for a 'Yes' resolution. The main point of divergence was the final probability, with my initial 90% being more conservative than their shared 95%. I found their reasoning convincing, particularly their framing of the downside risks (accounting lags, unannounced repayments) as 'tail risks' that are unlikely to be large enough to erase the entire buffer. They did not raise new evidence, but their higher confidence in the existing evidence prompted me to re-evaluate whether my 10% uncertainty was calibrated correctly.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I am updating my forecast. My initial assessment correctly identified the key quantitative factors pointing towards a significant increase in debt, summing to approximately 52 billion UAH. This is well above the 31 billion UAH increase needed to cross the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold. My initial 90% probability assigned a 10% chance that unquantified factors, such as accounting lags on loan disbursements or higher-than-expected debt servicing costs, could negate the projected increase. However, both other forecasters compellingly argued that the ~21 billion UAH buffer is sufficiently large to absorb such shocks. The source material notes debt servicing costs were 'modest', making it highly improbable they would exceed 20 billion UAH. For the outcome to be 'No', a combination of unlikely negative events would have to occur simultaneously. The consensus view that these are low-probability, 'tail risk' events is persuasive. Therefore, I am increasing my confidence and updating my forecast from 90% to 95%, aligning with the other experts.",
