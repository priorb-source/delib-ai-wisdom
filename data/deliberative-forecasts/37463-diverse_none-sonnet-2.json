    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I initially missed: the resolution criteria asks whether Berkshire will HOLD greater than 10,000,000 shares, not necessarily whether they will PURCHASE MORE. This is a crucial distinction. If Berkshire's current position is already above 10M shares (Forecaster 3 claims ~10.7M through 2024), then the base case would be maintaining that position, which resolves Yes. Forecaster 2 claims Berkshire held 'exactly 10,000,000 shares' - this factual disagreement is pivotal. Both forecasters agree on Berkshire's low portfolio turnover and recent net-seller stance, but they reach vastly different conclusions (20% vs 82%). The key insight is that with a low-turnover firm like Berkshire, if they're already above the threshold, the question becomes 'will they stay above it?' rather than 'will they buy more?' The main No scenarios would be: (1) trimming below 10M, or (2) obtaining confidential treatment. Without access to the most recent 13F data showing exact current holdings, I face significant factual uncertainty. However, Forecaster 3's interpretation of the resolution criteria appears more accurate than my initial reading.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I misaligned my forecast with the actual resolution criteria. The question title mentions 'purchase of more' but resolution depends solely on holding >10M shares as of March 31, 2025. If current holdings are meaningfully above 10M (as Forecaster 3 suggests with ~10.7M), then given Berkshire's documented low turnover and the fact that this is a deputy-managed position that has remained stable, the probability of maintaining above 10M should be substantially higher than my initial 25%. However, I cannot fully adopt Forecaster 3's 82% because: (1) the exact current holdings remain uncertain given conflicting information, (2) Berkshire's recent pattern of being a net seller and trimming large tech positions like Apple creates non-trivial downside risk, (3) there's a possibility of confidential treatment. Balancing these factors, I'm updating significantly upward to account for the likelihood that if they're already above threshold, portfolio inertia favors staying above it, while maintaining caution about the factual uncertainty regarding current position size.",
