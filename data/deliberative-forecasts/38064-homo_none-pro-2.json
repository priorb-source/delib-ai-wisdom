    "review": "The other forecasters share my core reasoning: a high base rate for corporate annual meetings occurring as scheduled, significantly adjusted downwards due to the specific precedent of Gamestop's 2024 server crash. We all identify the company's strong incentive to avoid a repeat failure and the unpredictable nature of 'meme stock' interest as the key variables. Forecaster 2's point that the 2024 failure makes a 2025 failure *less* likely, rather than more likely, is particularly persuasive. This frames the past event not just as an indicator of risk, but as a powerful learning event that would trigger significant over-preparation to avoid a second, more damaging, public embarrassment. This argument is more compelling than my initial reasoning which may have been overly anchored to the negative precedent.",
    "rationale": "I am increasing my forecast from 85% to 90%. The deliberation, particularly with Forecaster 2, has convinced me that I was overweighting the probability of a repeat failure. The argument that the 2024 server crash serves as a powerful learning event is key. The company is no longer operating in ignorance of the potential traffic; they now have a concrete, extreme data point to plan against. The reputational cost of a second consecutive failure would be immense, creating a powerful incentive to over-prepare and contract with a top-tier vendor capable of handling extreme load. The problem is now a 'known unknown'—a manageable, if challenging, technical issue—rather than an 'unknown unknown' as it may have been in 2024. A 10% chance of failure still appropriately accounts for the inherent unpredictability of retail investor hype and the strictness of the resolution criteria (any postponement results in a 'No'), but a 15% chance now seems too high given the company's awareness and motivation.",
