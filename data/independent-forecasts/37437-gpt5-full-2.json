  "information": "U.S. Indo-Pacific Commander Admiral Samuel Paparo stated in May 2025 that while the U.S. could currently defeat China in a Taiwan Strait conflict, China's military is expanding its capabilities rapidly. Paparo noted that China is producing warships at a rate of 6 per year compared to the U.S.'s 1.8. He also stated that China's military pressure on Taiwan had escalated by 300% in 2024. In response to heightened tensions, Taiwan's Ministry of Defense announced its annual 'Han Kuang' military exercises in summer 2025 will, for the first time, simulate a response to a potential Chinese invasion specifically set in the year 2027.\n\nMultiple U.S. officials and intelligence reports have pointed to 2027 as a key year for China's military readiness regarding Taiwan. In February 2023, CIA Director Bill Burns stated that Chinese leader Xi Jinping had ordered the military to be prepared for an invasion by 2027. This timeline is consistently referenced by U.S. military leaders as a target for the PLA to complete its preparations. Chinese activities preceding this date include intensified propaganda, such as a March 2025 video showing large-scale landing ships, and the use of 'grey zone' military exercises to test Taiwan's defenses.\n\nBroader geopolitical factors include Japan's decision to undertake its largest military expansion since World War II, with the goal of doubling its defense budget by 2027, partly in response to the perceived Chinese threat to Taiwan. The U.S. and Japan have conducted joint military exercises on Japanese islands near Taiwan. Economically, a report in The Economist suggested the U.S.-China trade war could influence events, though some scholars believe China's internal economic situation makes military action less likely. The Council on Foreign Relations has assessed a security crisis in the Taiwan Strait as 'moderately likely' in 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 weeks (≈56 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No accusation. Continued PLA gray-zone pressure (air/naval sorties, exercises, cyber/economic coercion) without PLA ground forces landing on Taiwan-held territory; U.S. issues warnings but does not use “invaded” language.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "PLA ramps up coercive drills or blockadelike activities and missile flights, but no amphibious/airborne landing on Taiwan proper or outlying islands (Kinmen/Matsu/Pratas/Taiping). The U.S. condemns destabilization but stops short of alleging a ground-force invasion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid PLA move lands ground troops on a Taiwan-held outlying island (e.g., Kinmen/Matsu/Pratas) or attempts an airborne/heliborne seizure on Taiwan proper; the U.S. publicly states China has invaded Taiwan by sending ground forces without Taipei’s consent.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: The world typically changes slowly. Despite elevated tensions, an actual PLA landing in the next ~8 weeks would be a major departure. Amphibious/airborne landings require visible mobilization and signaling that would likely be detected and telegraphed; none is currently evident.\n- Assistant’s report context: U.S. officials repeatedly cite 2027 as a key PLA readiness date. Admiral Paparo’s May 2025 remarks emphasize growing Chinese capability and increased 2024 pressure, but also imply current deterrence is credible. Taiwan’s 2025 Han Kuang exercise simulating a 2027 invasion underscores the consensus that the near-term window is less likely than the medium-term. CFR’s “moderately likely” security crisis in 2025 points to heightened risk of incidents and coercion, not necessarily a ground-force landing.\n- Why not higher: To resolve Yes, the U.S. must publicly accuse the PRC of invading by sending ground troops. Most near-term escalations (encirclement drills, air/missile strikes, maritime harassment) wouldn’t meet this bar. Beijing has incentives to avoid a premature move before full readiness and when surprise is limited. The U.S. also tends to calibrate language carefully; even a serious incident might be labeled an “attack” or “seizure” rather than “invasion,” depending on circumstances.\n- Why not lower: Tail risks remain. A limited fait accompli against a lightly defended outlying island, an accident-turned-crisis around Kinmen/Matsu, or domestic-political shocks in China could prompt a sudden move. If such a landing occurred, the U.S. would likely characterize it as an invasion, satisfying the question’s criteria.\n- What would move me up: Credible indicators of imminent PLA landing operations (massing of amphibious/airborne forces, declared large exclusion zones near Taiwan-held islands, civil/military mobilization on China’s coast, PRC evacuation orders or capital controls, surge maritime militia swarms near outlying islands), allied evacuation advisories, or U.S. intelligence leaks/official warnings of impending ground action.\n- What would move me down: Clear de-escalation, canceled/cooled PLA exercises, resumed cross-strait dialogue or CBMs, or sustained signals from U.S./Taiwan/Japan that near-term risk has ebbed.\nOverall, near-term probability of a U.S. accusation of a ground-force invasion before July 1, 2025 is low but non-zero due to tail-risk scenarios focused on outlying islands.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
