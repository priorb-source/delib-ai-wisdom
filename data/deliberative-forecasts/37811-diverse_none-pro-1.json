    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. I find Forecaster 3's reasoning particularly compelling and well-structured. Their key distinction between the removal of website *content* (which the background article discusses) and the takedown of an entire *domain* (which the resolution criteria addresses) is a crucial point that strengthens the case for a 'Yes' outcome. They also correctly note that the resolution criteria ('on or after July 1') makes the outcome resilient to brief, transient outages. Forecaster 2 correctly identifies the political risk as the primary driver of uncertainty but, in my view, overstates it by assigning a 13% probability of failure. I believe this conflates the risk to content with the much higher bar of taking a major scientific agency's top-level domain completely offline. Forecaster 3's analysis provides a more nuanced and evidence-based framework for what remains a high-confidence forecast.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 98% was based on the high institutional inertia of major government websites and the short timeframe remaining until resolution. The deliberation has reinforced this core view. Forecaster 3's analysis, in particular, solidified my thinking by explicitly differentiating the political threat to website content versus the threat to domain availability. The historical precedent shows that even under administrations hostile to climate science, domains tend to persist even if content is altered or archived. Given that Climate.gov is currently operational several months into the new presidential term, a sudden, high-profile takedown in the next 41 days seems highly improbable. However, the discussion has prompted me to slightly increase the probability I assign to tail risks. Forecaster 3's mention of a 'deliberate depublication or domain-level redirect/misconfiguration' is a plausible, albeit unlikely, failure scenario that I may have initially underestimated. To account for this slightly broadened view of potential failure modes, I am adjusting my forecast modestly downward. I am moving from 98% to 96%, reflecting a shift from a 2% to a 4% perceived chance of failure. This change acknowledges the non-zero political risks discussed by both forecasters while still reflecting my strong conviction that the site will remain online.",
