  "information": "In January 2025, Databricks completed a major funding round, raising over $15.25 billion. This included a $10 billion Series J equity financing round, which valued the company at $62 billion, and an additional $5.25 billion in debt financing provided by several major banks. New investors in the equity round included Meta as a strategic partner. The funding is intended to accelerate the development of new AI products, expand market reach, and finance acquisitions. A portion of the funds was also designated to offer liquidity to current and former employees.\n\nDatabricks has an upcoming Data + AI Summit scheduled for June 9-12, 2025. Keynote speakers announced for the event include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase, Anthropic, and Microsoft. Previously, Databricks CEO Ali Ghodsi had described 2024 as a \"dumb\" year for IPOs and has made statements suggesting flexibility on the timing of a public offering, mentioning both 2025 and 2026 as possibilities. A January 2025 report noted that a public offering within a year \"wouldn't be a huge surprise.\"\n\nAs of late May 2025, there have been no public reports of Databricks selecting underwriters for an IPO or of the company making a confidential S-1 filing with the SEC. Market sentiment has been described as uncertain, with some IPO advisors noting that while planning is occurring, macroeconomic concerns might cause delays. Other major tech startups, such as Stripe, have also remained private despite IPO expectations. In contrast, companies like Klarna and eToro have reportedly filed confidential IPO paperwork.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Roughly five and a half weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The company has not yet announced an IPO and there is no strong, immediate driver for them to do so in the next several weeks.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Databricks leverages its massive January 2025 funding round to continue its growth trajectory as a private company. Management decides that macroeconomic conditions are not ideal and opts to wait until late 2025 or 2026 for a public offering, letting the July 1, 2025 deadline pass without an announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Having already filed a confidential S-1, Databricks uses the significant media attention from its Data + AI Summit in mid-June 2025 as a platform to publicly announce its IPO plans, either via a statement on its website or by making its S-1 filing public.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored in the status quo, where Databricks remains a private company. The evidence strongly suggests this is unlikely to change before July 1, 2025. The most significant factor is the massive $15.25 billion funding round completed in January 2025. This capital injection, which included a component for employee liquidity, greatly reduces the two primary pressures for an IPO: raising capital for growth and providing a return for employees and early investors. Furthermore, CEO Ali Ghodsi has publicly expressed a patient and flexible approach to timing, suggesting 2025 or 2026 are possibilities, which indicates no urgency to act within the next five weeks. The lack of public information regarding key IPO preparatory steps, such as selecting underwriters, further supports a later timeline. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 20% primarily because of the upcoming Data + AI Summit from June 9-12, 2025. Major industry events are a common venue for significant corporate announcements, and an IPO plan would certainly qualify. It is plausible, though not probable, that the company has already made a confidential S-1 filing and is waiting for this strategic moment to announce its plans to the public. The intense competition and investor interest in the AI sector means that market windows can be exploited quickly. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the arguments against a near-term announcement are more compelling. The short time frame, the recent and substantial private funding, and the CEO's cautious public stance all outweigh the speculative possibility of a surprise announcement at the summit. For my forecast to increase, I would need to see credible rumors or leaks about an S-1 filing or underwriter selection. Conversely, my forecast would decrease significantly if the Data + AI Summit concludes without any IPO-related news.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn January 2025, Databricks completed a major funding round, raising over $15.25 billion.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
