    "review": "The other forecasters provided two critical pieces of information that my initial analysis lacked. Forecaster 3 introduced the most important data point: the April 2025 meeting resulted in a 16-32 vote, falling 8 votes short of the required 24. This quantifies the challenge precisely and provides a concrete baseline of support and opposition. Forecaster 2 highlighted a crucial misinterpretation on my part regarding the resolution criteria: that *any restriction* on the play, not just an outright ban, would resolve the question as 'Yes'. This insight is key, as it opens the door for a compromise solution that could be more palatable to skeptical owners and is a common way the league finds consensus. Both forecasters' reasoning was highly convincing. Forecaster 3's data-driven approach, focusing on the 8-vote gap, grounds the forecast in reality, while Forecaster 2's focus on institutional process and the potential for a compromise provides the most likely path to a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 20% to 28%. My initial forecast was too low because it did not account for the a) the high level of existing support for a ban and b) the possibility of a compromise rule. The new information that the proposal already has 16 votes—half the league—demonstrates that this is not a fringe issue but a deeply divisive one with a substantial coalition in favor of change. The primary challenge, as Forecaster 3 correctly identifies, is gaining 8 more votes in a short period. However, Forecaster 2's point that 'any restriction' qualifies as a 'Yes' provides the mechanism to bridge this gap. The league office and Competition Committee can now work on crafting a watered-down version (e.g., limiting the number of pushers) to present at the May 20-21 meeting. Such a compromise could be framed as a move to preserve the spirit of the game without eliminating the play entirely, which might be enough to persuade the necessary 8 owners. The 24-vote supermajority remains a very high bar, and institutional inertia still favors the 'No' outcome. However, the combination of a strong existing support base, a powerful institutional push for change, and a clear path to a compromise solution makes the probability of a ban higher than I initially assessed. My forecast is now 28%, reflecting that a 'No' is still the most likely outcome, but the path to 'Yes' is clearer and more plausible.",
