    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from April 25, 2025, to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No successful coup occurs in Africa or Latin America, and the current governments remain in power through established legal and constitutional means.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing political tensions and instability in several countries, particularly in Africa's Sahel region and parts of Latin America, no military or other state elite group successfully overthrows a sitting executive before July 1, 2025. There might be failed attempts, political crises, or popular protests, but none will meet the resolution criteria for a successful coup d'état.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A military junta in a country within Africa's 'coup belt' (e.g., Chad, Sudan, or a counter-coup in Mali or Burkina Faso) seizes control of the government, secures the loyalty of the armed forces, and overcomes any significant resistance. Alternatively, a similar event unfolds in a politically volatile Latin American nation where factions within the state apparatus successfully unseat the president.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on a historical base rate derived from the high frequency of recent coups, adjusted for the short timeframe. \n\n1.  **Base Rate:** Since mid-2020, there has been a significant 'coup contagion' in Africa, with at least seven successful coups (Mali x2, Guinea, Burkina Faso x2, Niger, Gabon). This establishes a historical rate of over 1.5 successful coups per year in the specified regions. Applying this rate to the short ~2-month forecast period suggests a non-trivial probability. The Sahel region in Africa is the primary contributor to this risk; the underlying drivers of instability—jihadist insurgencies, weak governance, and geopolitical competition—persist and show no signs of abating.\n\n2.  **Regional Analysis:** While Latin America has experienced instability and recent failed coup attempts (Bolivia 2024, Peru 2022), the threshold for a *successful* coup appears higher there than in the Sahel. Therefore, Africa accounts for the vast majority of the risk in this forecast.\n\n3.  **Why this probability?** My forecast of 22% reflects a significant chance of a coup, grounded in the high recent frequency. A probability above 40% would be too high, as it would imply a coup is a likely event within a very specific two-month window, which would require evidence of a present and acute crisis that is not currently visible. Conversely, a probability below 15% would be too low, as it would improperly discount the persistent and potent trend of military takeovers in the Sahel. The status quo of no coup remains the most likely single outcome, but the risk of disruption is substantial.\n\n4.  **Update Factors:** I would increase my forecast upon credible reports of a military mutiny, the arrest of senior government officials by security forces, or a leader's unconstitutional attempt to extend their power in a high-risk country. I would decrease my forecast if regional bodies (like ECOWAS or the African Union) or international powers took unusually strong and credible preemptive action to stabilize a government facing a specific threat.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to [Powell & Thyne (2011, p. 252)](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf), a coup is \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\" In recent years, some of the coups in Africa have been:&#x20;\n\n* [Mali August 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Mali May 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Niger March 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Nigerien_coup_attempt) (attempt)\n* [Niger July 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nigerien_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Gabon August 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Gabonese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Chad January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%27Djamena_attack) (possible attempt)\n* [Burkina Faso January 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Burkina Faso September 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)&#x20;\n* [Guinea September 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n\nLatin America has had the following coup attempts in recent years:\n\n* [Peru self-coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Peruvian_self-coup_attempt), December 2022\n* [Brazil Congress attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack), January 2023\n* [Bolivia coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bolivian_coup_attempt), June 2024\n\nSee also: [VoA by the numbers Coups in Africa](https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is a successful coup d’état in any country on the African continent or Latin America before July 1, 2025, according to credible media reports. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nLatin America is defined as any country in North America or South America whose primary language is Spanish, Portuguese or French.\n\nA coup d’état (often shortened to \"coup\") is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) as an event in which a state's military or other components of its power structure overthrow the existing political authority.&#x20;\n\nA \"successful\" coup is defined as a coup in which the group or person attempting to seize power establishes control over both the government and military, and will be considered to have succeeded once any significant resistance to their authority has ceased.&#x20;\n\nA self-coup, [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup) as a political leader, having come to power through legal means, remaining in power through illegal means, will count. This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
