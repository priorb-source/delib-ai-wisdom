    "review": "Both forecasters correctly emphasize Article 21(2) GG, the Federal Constitutional Court’s exclusive competence, and the lengthy, multi-stage nature of party-ban proceedings. Forecaster 3 adds useful historical timelines (SRP, KPD, NPD) that reinforce the multi-months-to-years baseline. Forecaster 2 clearly articulates the tail-risk channel (extraordinary event + unprecedented fast track) but rightly treats it as vanishingly small. Neither introduces evidence of a filed case, docketing, or Court signals—key triggers that would materially move the odds. I find their reasoning solid and consistent with my prior view; the added historical detail supports nudging the forecast slightly lower.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is ~60 days. No sign of a formal application by a competent applicant (Bundestag majority, Bundesrat, or Federal Government), and even if filed imminently, the Court’s process (written submissions, evidence, hearings, deliberation) would not plausibly conclude by July 1. Past party-ban cases took far longer, and AfD’s size and political salience would only increase evidentiary and procedural complexity. Importantly, other institutions (e.g., BfV, Interior Ministries) cannot ban a political party; only the Constitutional Court can, which tightens the path. If any near-term action occurred, a funding/privilege withdrawal proceeding under the 2017 constitutional amendment is more plausible than an outright ban, but the question requires an official ban announcement. Given this, I slightly lower my estimate to reflect the near-zero tail risk identified by Forecaster 2, while acknowledging that a total zero is inappropriate absent absolute impossibility.",
