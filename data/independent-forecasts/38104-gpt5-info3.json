  "information": "As of May 30, 2025, eight of the ten escapees have been recaptured. Some captures occurred out of state, including two inmates who were apprehended in Walker County, Texas, after a high-speed chase. The two fugitives still at large are Antoine Massey, 33, and Derrick Groves, 27, who are both considered armed and dangerous. Groves is a convicted murderer awaiting sentencing for a double homicide. Massey is described as a 'serial escapee' with three prior escapes from custody and was also being sought for kidnapping and rape. A former federal warden noted that Massey's housing in a first-floor cell was a significant security risk.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 31 days (until end of June 30, 2025, local time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — as of May 30, two fugitives remain at large; absent new breaks, at least one is likely still free by July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "One of the remaining fugitives (e.g., Antoine Massey) leverages local networks and prior experience to avoid detection, possibly moving between safe houses or out of state with help; despite tips and task force efforts, there’s no decisive lead before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "US Marshals develop a lead from surveillance of associates or LPR hits, triggering raids that apprehend Groves; a separate tip or vehicle stop in another state results in Massey’s arrest (or either is killed during a confrontation) before June 30.",
    "rationale": "- Where things stand: Per the assistant’s report, by May 30 eight of ten escapees from the May 16 New Orleans jailbreak have been recaptured, including two out of state. Two remain: Derrick Groves (convicted murderer, considered armed/dangerous) and Antoine Massey (described as a serial escapee with three prior escapes, also wanted for kidnapping and rape). A state probe is underway and there is high scrutiny.\n\n- Base-rate and hazard reasoning: In mass escapes, most are caught quickly; the last holdouts are typically the most capable, best connected, or farthest away, and captures then follow a slower, heavy‑tailed pattern. A rough daily capture hazard for late-stage fugitives might be on the order of 1–3% per person; over ~31 days this implies 46–60% chance to catch each individual, and 21–36% for both (assuming independence). Correlations (shared networks, common geography, joint task force pressure) can push this up or down; given both are high-risk and motivated, I weight downward.\n\n- Factors pushing probability up: intense public pressure and federal involvement (US Marshals), demonstrated reach across states (prior captures in Texas), and the possibility that either fugitive engages in risky activity (vehicle thefts, contacting associates) that generates leads. Death during apprehension also counts toward Yes.\n\n- Factors pushing probability down: these are the two most elusive; Massey’s history of multiple escapes suggests skill at evasion; Groves faces severe sentencing, increasing flight incentives. If they already displaced out of state with support, timelines often extend beyond a month. OPSO’s criticized security posture and coordination challenges can also slow progress, though federal support mitigates this.\n\n- Why not higher: The remaining pair are likely the hardest to catch; late-stage manhunts commonly stretch beyond a month. Prior escapes and potential assistance reduce the per-day capture rate.\n\n- Why not lower: There is still about a month, nationwide attention, and eight have been caught already, indicating active leads and broad jurisdictional cooperation. Violent fugitives often surface due to mistakes or associate surveillance.\n\n- What would move me up: credible sightings or confirmed leads (e.g., LPR hits, surveillance of associates, reward increases), arrest of close associates, capture of one of the two, or announcements of concentrated multi-agency operations in a narrowed area.\n\n- What would move me down: several weeks without sightings; credible reports they fled a distant region or have robust safe-house support; signs of reduced task force intensity; evidence of organized assistance enabling sustained evasion.\n\nOverall, given the month-long window and the fugitives’ profiles, I place the chance all ten are recaptured or killed by July 1 modestly below even odds.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in New Orleans on May 16, 2025 be recaptured before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Manhunt continues Monday for 7 Orleans jail escapees as state launches investigation](https://www.fox8live.com/2025/05/19/manhunt-continues-monday-7-orleans-jail-escapees-state-launches-investigation/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, all 10 inmates who escaped from jail in the [2025 New Orleans jailbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_New_Orleans_jailbreak) have been either recaptured or killed, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions). If any are still at large on July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of May 30, 2025, eight of the ten escapees have been recaptured.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
