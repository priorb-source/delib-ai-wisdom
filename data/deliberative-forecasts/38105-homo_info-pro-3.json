    "review": "The other forecasters present a well-defined debate between momentum and inertia. Forecaster 2 (60%) makes a strong case for positive momentum, highlighting new information I hadn't considered: a physical IMF mission in Beirut for formal negotiations, a scheduled second round, and the discussion of a specific $3 billion EFF. These are compelling indicators of serious engagement. Conversely, Forecaster 3 (5%) provides a crucial counterpoint, also with new information: the IMF's own characterization of progress as 'slow' and the fact that core issues like bank restructuring remain 'unresolved'. I find Forecaster 3's reasoning more convincing. While Forecaster 2 correctly identifies signs of *activity*, Forecaster 3 correctly identifies the lack of *progress* on the substantive, structural reforms that have been the primary obstacle for years. Forecaster 2's optimism seems to underweight Lebanon's multi-year history of political paralysis, where high-level talks have previously failed to produce action.",
    "rationale": "I am not changing my forecast. The new arguments provided by my fellow forecasters present conflicting signals that ultimately reinforce my initial assessment. Forecaster 2’s information about the active and specific nature of the current IMF negotiations is a valid positive indicator that prevents me from lowering my forecast. It confirms there is a plausible path to an agreement being discussed. However, Forecaster 3's information that the IMF itself views progress as 'slow' and that fundamental disagreements persist is a powerful negative indicator that directly counteracts this optimism. It suggests that while the 'process' of negotiation is active, the 'substance' of the agreement is just as stuck as it has been for years. In Lebanon, overcoming the political deadlock on substance is the true challenge, not simply holding meetings. These new data points effectively cancel each other out, leaving my core thesis unchanged: the immense difficulty of achieving political consensus on painful, vested-interest-challenging reforms within an extremely tight one-month deadline remains the dominant factor. The probability of success remains low.",
