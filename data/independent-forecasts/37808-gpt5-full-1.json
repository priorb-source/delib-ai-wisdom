  "information": "The U.S. Department of State released the results for the Diversity Visa Program (DV-2026) lottery in early May 2025. Applicants can check their status online through the Entrant Status Check page until September 30, 2026. This followed the release of the DV-2025 results on May 3, 2025. The registration period for the DV-2026 lottery ran from October to November 2024. The program awards up to 55,000 permanent residence visas annually. The State Department has emphasized that the official website, dvprogram.state.gov, is the only channel for results.\n\nThe Diversity Visa program was established by the Immigration Act of 1990. The Trump administration, which began in January 2025, has previously expressed opposition to the program. The administration issued executive orders in January 2025 concerning Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) related websites across federal agencies. In April 2025, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives with the goal of terminating the statutory DV program.\n\nIn May 2025, the US Department of State imposed visa restrictions on Indian travel agency executives and staff who were found to have knowingly enabled unlawful entry into the US. In a separate action, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the termination of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Afghanistan, scheduled to take effect on July 14, 2025. Concurrently, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction that blocked a DHS attempt to terminate TPS for Venezuelan nationals.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The State Department restructures or purges DV content before July 1, causing this exact URL to 404 or redirect to a generic page without the Step 1 “Submit an Entry” instructions; or a rapid legislative/administrative action directs removal of DV instructional pages and State takes them down immediately.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The DV Step 1 page remains in place as a standing informational page (likely noting the entry period is closed until fall), with the same URL and instructions accessible as usual on and after July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: Government web content, especially on travel.state.gov, is stable. The DV program is statutory and ongoing; DV-2026 results were released in early May 2025, and Entrant Status Check remains open through Sept 30, 2026. This strongly suggests continued maintenance of related informational pages, including Step 1 instructions, at least through the summer.\n- Time horizon: Only ~6 weeks until resolution. Large site restructures or legal changes that would justify pulling the page are unlikely to complete within this window.\n- Policy risk: While the administration has historically opposed the Diversity Visa and a House bill was introduced in April 2025 to terminate it, repealing a statute would require Senate passage and the President’s signature. Even then, agencies typically phase changes; immediate pre–July 1 removal of an instructional page is less likely, particularly while DV-2026 processing is active. Past periods of restrictive policy (2017–2021) did not result in the DV instructional pages disappearing from travel.state.gov.\n- Technical/website risk: The biggest practical risk is a URL/IA change. If State revises the DV section or renames the Step 1 page before July 1, this exact path could 404 or redirect. Depending on resolver interpretation, a redirect might not count as “the page is at this location.” This risk, plus routine site maintenance or content consolidation, accounts for most of the downside.\n- Research assistant highlights affecting the forecast: DV-2026 results are live (May 2025) and official communications point to dvprogram.state.gov for results; this indicates active program operations and suggests related travel.state.gov info persists. The DEI website EOs are tangential. Other immigration actions (TPS decisions, targeted visa restrictions) do not directly implicate DV pages.\n- Why not higher: Small but real chance of URL change/redirect or targeted content removal as part of a fast-moving political push or a mid-year site reorganization.\n- Why not lower: Short time frame, strong institutional inertia, ongoing DV-2026 processing, and historical stability of the travel.state.gov information architecture.\n- Update signals upward: Confirmation that the specific URL is live in late June; State posting schedules indicating no imminent site restructure.\n- Update signals downward: Rapid movement of DV-termination legislation with immediate-effect provisions; State web notice of DV content consolidation/URL changes; observed 404/redirect of this path prior to July 1.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
