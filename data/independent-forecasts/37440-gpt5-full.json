  "information": "Several bills concerning voter citizenship verification were considered in Florida's legislature. HB 831 would require state-issued IDs to indicate non-citizen status. HB 1381 would require voters to provide proof of citizenship, such as a passport or birth certificate, for new or updated registrations. SB 1330 would require first-time voters to present similar documentation. The 2025 regular legislative session concluded without enacting these bills. A comprehensive bill containing similar provisions, CS/HB 1381, was withdrawn from consideration on May 3, 2025. An extended legislative session, constitutionally required to pass the state budget, began on May 12, 2025.\n\nFlorida's legislature is controlled by a Republican supermajority in both chambers. Governor Ron DeSantis has a history of supporting and signing legislation described as strengthening election integrity. In May 2025, DeSantis signed a law that creates new hurdles for the citizens' initiative process, including a ban on non-citizens and non-residents from gathering signatures for petitions. This followed the enactment of SB 7016 in April 2025, which also restricts ballot initiatives.\n\nThe push for expanded voter citizenship verification in Florida aligns with a broader national trend. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which would require proof of citizenship for voter registration nationwide, though it is unlikely to pass the Senate. Separately, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose stricter verification requirements. Other states have also advanced similar legislation; Wyoming passed a law requiring proof of citizenship to vote that is set to become effective on July 1, and a bill in Tennessee to create a citizenship verification portal for election workers has advanced in its state house.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The budget-focused extended session stays limited to appropriations, implementing, and conforming bills without election-policy riders; no separate special session is called or opened to election law; the previously filed citizenship-verification bills remain dead; nothing is enacted before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Leadership or the Governor adds election/citizenship verification to the special session call (or secures two-thirds votes to take up off-call items), and a narrowed measure such as HB 831 (ID marking for non-citizens) or HB 1381/SB 1330-style proof-of-citizenship for some registrants passes both chambers and is signed by Gov. DeSantis before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: Florida’s 2025 regular session ended without passing the proof‑of‑citizenship proposals (HB 1381/SB 1330; HB 831). CS/HB 1381 was withdrawn May 3. An extended session to finish the budget begins May 12. Republicans hold supermajorities and Gov. DeSantis routinely signs “election integrity” measures. National GOP is pushing analogous changes (e.g., the SAVE Act), and other states are moving in this direction.\n- Baseline/status quo: With the regular session over and no bill passed, the default is No. Special sessions are typically constrained by the call; the May session is constitutionally driven to pass the budget. Florida can and does pass only budget and closely related implementing/conforming bills in such sessions.\n- Paths to Yes still exist but are nontrivial: The Governor can expand the call to include election law, or the Legislature can open the agenda with two‑thirds in each chamber (which the GOP can reach). They could also try to tuck a targeted citizenship‑verification provision into an implementing/conforming bill (arguing an administrative/fiscal nexus), or pass a narrow measure like HB 831 that the question explicitly says would count. If taken up, passage and a quick gubernatorial signature before July 1 are very plausible given partisan alignment.\n- Why not higher: The key evidence is failure during regular session despite unified GOP control and the lateness of the calendar. If leadership truly wanted this this year, the cleanest window was the regular session. Adding a controversial, litigable election change into a budget session invites procedural and political friction. Litigation risk (NVRA preemption for proof‑of‑citizenship at registration) may also make leadership more cautious, favoring deferment to a later session or a narrower administrative approach.\n- Why not lower: The supermajority plus a supportive governor makes late action possible, and any subset requirement counts (including ID markings for non‑citizens or first‑time registrant documentation). National salience and signals from Trump-world could catalyze a quick, symbolic move. Procedural hurdles (special session call or two‑thirds vote to expand the scope) are surmountable with current majorities.\n- What would move me up: The special session call or formal agendas include election/citizenship items; draft implementing/conforming bills emerge with citizenship‑verification provisions; public statements by the Governor, Senate President, or House Speaker prioritizing this in May/June; a separate election-focused special session is announced before July 1.\n- What would move me down: The special session call remains strictly budget-only and adjourns without any off‑call expansions; key sponsors/leadership signal deferral to a future session; no draft text appears by early June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral bills concerning voter citizenship verification were considered in Florida's legislature.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
