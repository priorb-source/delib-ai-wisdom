  "information": "On March 13, 2025, the government of Chad officially granted Starlink an operating license. The stated goal is to enhance internet connectivity, particularly in remote areas where the existing 6,000 km of fiber optic infrastructure is insufficient, and to support educational and healthcare institutions. Government officials have stated that negotiations were conducted to ensure affordable pricing for the service.\n\nThe time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming 'Available' on its map varies in other African nations. For the Democratic Republic of Congo, the process took approximately 10 weeks in 2025. For Malawi and Zambia, it was about 16 weeks, and for Benin, it was 24 weeks. Niger's service was officially launched on March 13, 2025, the same day Chad's license was announced. In May 2025, a pan-African partnership between SpaceX and Airtel was announced to potentially accelerate kit distribution.\n\nStarlink's expansion faces both technical advantages and logistical challenges. The use of optical inter-satellite links reduces the need for local ground stations in every country. However, high demand has led to service pauses and waiting lists in other regions, including some African countries like Nigeria and Kenya. For Chad specifically, potential obstacles include its landlocked geography, limited retail infrastructure, and the need to finalize details such as import rules and spectrum fees.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Regulatory and operational steps (finalizing import/tariff rules, spectrum fee arrangements, local sales/onboarding) take longer, so Starlink keeps Chad as “Coming Soon” through June. The map flips to Available only after early July, consistent with ~16–24 week lags seen in some nearby markets.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink batches a Sahel rollout and flips Chad to “Available” in mid-to-late June, shortly after internal go-live readiness is achieved (similar to DRC’s ~10-week cadence), perhaps aided by the Airtel partnership and low expected congestion over Chad.",
    "rationale": "Timing math: Formal go-ahead appears March 13, 2025. July 1 is ~15.7 weeks after that. Recent African precedents from the assistant: DRC ~10 weeks (fast), Malawi/Zambia ~16 weeks (typical), Benin ~24 weeks (slow). Niger launched the same day as Chad’s license announcement, implying regional readiness exists, but we don’t yet see Chad on the map.\n\nBase rate and status quo: If we center on ~16 weeks as a typical activation window, July 1 is slightly earlier than that median. With the world changing slowly, the default is that the map does not flip before July 1 unless there is a push. The Benin case shows long tails are possible. On the other hand, DRC shows a faster path can happen.\n\nChad specifics that could lift odds: low user density and ample satellite capacity reduce congestion risk; optical inter-satellite links mean no immediate need for local gateways; Airtel partnership (May 2025) may help logistics and sales readiness. Also, the criterion is lenient: any area in Chad marked “Available” qualifies.\n\nChad specifics that could depress odds: landlocked logistics, import/type-approval/VAT/spectrum-fee housekeeping, and SpaceX’s tendency to align map availability with shipment readiness can all add weeks. Malawi/Zambia’s ~16 weeks points to a timeline that would land just after our cutoff (around July 3 if replicated).\n\nWhy not higher: The modal African timeline appears around 16+ weeks; our cutoff is slightly earlier than that, and we have no concrete signal of imminent activation for Chad as of May 15.\n\nWhy not lower: DRC’s 10-week example and the Niger same-day launch suggest Starlink can move quickly in this region; capacity constraints over Chad are likely minimal; a partial or capital-only map activation could satisfy the resolution.\n\nWhat would move me up: credible reports of terminal type-approval and customs clearance finalized; Starlink or government announcements of imminent launch; Airtel or local distributors advertising near-term availability; Starlink map showing waitlist tiles turning to “Available” in neighboring countries on the same beam footprint.\n\nWhat would move me down: signs of regulatory friction (fees, import rules), delays in other recent African activations, or a public pause due to capacity or supply constraints.\n",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
