    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks, when the official April 2025 inflation data is released by Eurostat.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The prevailing trend is disinflationary, driven by restrictive monetary policy from the European Central Bank. If this trend continues as expected, inflation will likely fall to or below the 2.2% threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ECB's tight monetary policy continues to effectively curb demand, wage growth moderates, and energy prices remain stable or decrease. The established disinflationary trend persists, bringing the April 2025 year-on-year inflation rate to 2.2% or lower.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unexpected supply-side shock, such as a surge in global energy prices, pushes up costs. Alternatively, domestic services inflation proves more persistent than anticipated due to resilient wage growth, preventing the headline rate from falling below the 2.2% threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong disinflationary trend currently dominant in the Euro Area, which is a direct consequence of the European Central Bank's (ECB) sustained restrictive monetary policy. The ECB's primary mandate is to return inflation to its 2% target, and its actions have been effective in cooling demand and bringing the headline rate down from its peak. The provided news from March, indicating downward revisions to February's inflation, supports the thesis that this disinflationary momentum is firmly in place. The status quo is a continued, gradual decline in the inflation rate. Therefore, the most likely outcome is that the rate will be at or below 2.2%.\n\nMy forecast is not lower (i.e., the probability of 'Yes' is not closer to zero) because of two key risks. First, services inflation has proven to be 'sticky' due to a relatively tight labor market and persistent wage growth, which could keep the headline number elevated. Second, the threshold of 2.2% is very close to recent inflation prints, meaning even a minor upside surprise, possibly from volatile energy prices or unfavorable base effects from April 2024, could be enough to tip the outcome to 'Yes'.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the primary driver—ECB monetary policy—is overwhelmingly pushing against inflation. Reversing the strong downward trend would require a significant economic shock, which is not my base case.\n\nI would increase my probability of a 'Yes' outcome if preliminary flash inflation data from major Eurozone economies for April showed a surprise acceleration, or if there were a significant geopolitical event causing a sharp spike in energy costs. Conversely, I would decrease my probability if flash data confirmed a continued deceleration in line with or faster than expectations.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Euro Area Inflation Rate be above 2.2% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nEuro News: [Euro falls as eurozone inflation sees downward revisions in February](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/03/19/euro-falls-as-eurozone-inflation-sees-downward-revisions-in-february)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Eurozone inflation rate for April 2025 is above 2.2% on an annualized basis according to [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
