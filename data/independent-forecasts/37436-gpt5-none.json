    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the 30 April 2025 OCHA impact snapshot reports 295 UN staff killed; if no newer snapshot is posted before July 1, it resolves to that number.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "OCHA stops publishing the impact snapshots before July 1, leaving 295 as the final figure, or publishes one last snapshot in May/June that still lists fewer than 300 (e.g., 295–299) because there are no additional UN staff fatalities and no retroactive confirmations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "OCHA publishes a May or June snapshot that raises the cumulative UN staff fatalities to 300+ due to additional incidents, or retroactive confirmation/attribution of previously missing or unconfirmed staff deaths; a single serious incident could add several fatalities at once.",
    "rationale": "The threshold is very close: only five more reported UN staff deaths are needed to reach 300. OCHA has been issuing regular monthly impact snapshots, and as of April 30 the count was already 295. Given ongoing hostilities and heightened operational risk (especially around Rafah operations), it is plausible that either new fatalities occur or prior deaths are confirmed/attributed and added to the tally in May or June. Either route would push the reported figure to 300+. The main downside risk is procedural: if OCHA ceases the snapshot series before July 1, the number would lock at 295 (a No). A genuine and sustained de-escalation/ceasefire with strong deconfliction could also keep additional UN staff fatalities at zero over the next two months, though even then retroactive confirmations could still tip it over 300. I put extra weight on the status quo: if nothing changes in publications, it resolves No at 295; however, OCHA’s consistent cadence argues for at least one more snapshot before July 1. The research assistant provided no additional information beyond the April 30 figure of 295, which anchors the baseline. Not higher: because of the nontrivial chance OCHA pauses/changes the snapshot series or that numbers remain flat through June. Not lower: because only five more are needed and both continued conflict and retroactive confirmation dynamics make a modest increase quite likely. I would update upward on any credible OCHA/UNRWA reports of further staff fatalities or an interim OCHA snapshot/revision crossing 300. I would update downward if OCHA signals suspension of snapshots, if a late-May snapshot stays below 300 and scheduling suggests no June update, or if a durable ceasefire with strengthened deconfliction is implemented promptly.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025. For example, a snapshot dated April 30, 2025, [reports](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/reported-impact-snapshot-gaza-strip-30-april-2025) 295 UN staff fatalities.\n\nIf OCHA stops posting new updates, this resolves as the most recent number, which as of the time of this question would be the impact snapshot posted on April 30, 2025.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
