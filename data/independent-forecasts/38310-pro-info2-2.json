  "information": "Between 2022 and 2024, Volodymyr Zelenskyy participated in three G7 summits: he attended the 2023 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, in person, and attended the 2022 summit in Elmau, Germany, and the 2024 summit in Apulia, Italy, virtually. Throughout the war, he has made numerous international trips, including visits to Washington, Paris, and Davos. On June 2, 2025, he arrived in Vilnius, Lithuania, to attend the Bucharest Nine summit ahead of the NATO summit scheduled for June 24-25 in The Hague.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Volodymyr Zelenskyy will attend the G7 summit in person, continuing his strategy of direct, high-level diplomacy to secure support for Ukraine's war effort.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden escalation of the conflict or a specific, credible security threat forces Zelenskyy to cancel his travel to Canada. He instead addresses the G7 leaders virtually, as he did in 2024, to avoid being absent from his country during a critical moment.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The battlefield situation remains manageable, allowing Zelenskyy to travel to Kananaskis. He attends the summit in person to engage in direct negotiations with G7 leaders, believing face-to-face diplomacy is crucial for securing the next tranche of military and financial aid.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the immense strategic importance of the G7 summit to Ukraine. President Zelenskyy has consistently engaged with the G7 since 2022, understanding it is a critical venue for securing the military and economic support necessary for his country's survival. The research indicates a history of extensive and high-stakes wartime travel, including his current trip to Lithuania, which confirms his operational capacity and willingness to travel for key diplomatic engagements. His in-person attendance at the 2023 Hiroshima summit sets a direct precedent for long-haul travel for this specific event.\n\nMy probability is not higher primarily due to the mixed precedent of his attendance. His virtual participation in the 2022 and, more pointedly, the 2024 summit in Italy demonstrates that in-person attendance is not automatic. The decision is clearly contingent on the security situation and strategic priorities at the time. The long distance to Canada also poses a greater logistical and security challenge than travel within Europe. Therefore, a sudden battlefield crisis or a credible threat could easily shift the decision towards virtual participation.\n\nConversely, my probability is not lower because the potential rewards of in-person diplomacy with the leaders of the world's most powerful economies are astronomical. Personal appeals and closed-door negotiations can achieve outcomes that virtual meetings cannot, especially concerning long-term security commitments and aid packages. Given the explicit invitation from host Prime Minister Carney, attending in person also strengthens bilateral ties with Canada, a key ally. The base rate of him attending in *some* form is near 100%; the key question is the mode of attendance, and the arguments for the higher-impact, in-person mode are compelling.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon confirmed reports of his travel logistics being arranged or a period of relative stability on the front lines. I would decrease my forecast in response to a major Russian offensive, a domestic political crisis in Ukraine, or official statements suggesting a virtual appearance is planned.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Volodymyr Zelenskyy attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCalgary Herald: [Prime Minister Carney invites Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to G7 summit in Kananaskis](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/pm-mark-carney-invites-ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-g7-summit-kananaskis)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelenskyy attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nBetween 2022 and 2024, Volodymyr Zelenskyy participated in three G7 summits: he attended the 2023 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, in person, and attended the 2022 summit in Elmau, Germany, and the 2024 summit in Apulia, Italy, virtually.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
