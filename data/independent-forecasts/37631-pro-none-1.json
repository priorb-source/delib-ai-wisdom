    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "45 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of mid-May 2025, Tesla's market capitalization is slightly higher than Walmart's.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tesla announces positive news regarding its next-generation vehicle, Full Self-Driving progress, or delivers a strong quarterly report, causing its stock to rally. Favorable macroeconomic conditions for growth stocks could also help Tesla maintain its lead over the more stable Walmart.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Tesla's stock continues its recent decline driven by concerns over slowing EV demand, increased competition, or missed production targets. In a risk-averse market, investors shift capital from volatile growth stocks like Tesla to stable, profitable companies like Walmart, resulting in Walmart's market cap surpassing Tesla's.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is 60%. As of today, May 13, 2025, the status quo is that Tesla has a slightly higher market capitalization than Walmart. However, this lead is marginal when compared to the historical volatility of Tesla's stock. With the outcome determined in just 45 days, short-term market sentiment and stock volatility are likely to be more decisive than long-term fundamentals.\n\nThe core of my rationale is the asymmetric volatility between the two companies. Walmart is a mature, stable value stock whose market cap is unlikely to experience drastic fluctuations in such a short period. Conversely, Tesla is a high-beta growth stock whose valuation is highly sensitive to news, sentiment, and progress on future-facing projects like AI and robotics. A 10-15% swing in Tesla's valuation over a six-week period is a common occurrence, and a downward swing of that magnitude would be sufficient to flip the outcome to 'Yes'. The provided background information citing a bearish analyst outlook supports the plausibility of such a decline.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the status quo is 'No', and Tesla's narrative can pivot extremely quickly. A single positive catalyst, such as a major FSD update or a shift in investor sentiment, could easily cause a sharp rally and solidify its lead. \n\nMy probability is not lower because the gap between the two companies is very small relative to Tesla's volatility. Given the prevailing negative sentiment mentioned in the background, only a minor downturn is needed for Tesla's market cap to fall below Walmart's highly stable valuation, making a crossover event more likely than not.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Walmart have a higher market cap than Tesla on June 27, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBusiness Insider: [Tesla's latest decline could be one for the history books, JPMorgan analysts say](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-stock-decline-jp-morgan-analyst-guidance-2025-3)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
