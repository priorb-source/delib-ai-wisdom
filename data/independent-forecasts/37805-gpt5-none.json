    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FlightsFrom.com lists only Guam and one or two Northeast Asia gateways (e.g., Seoul Incheon, possibly Busan), totaling four or fewer destinations on/after July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "By early July, FlightsFrom.com shows Guam, Seoul (ICN), plus multiple additional seasonal or newly restored routes (e.g., Busan, Tokyo Narita, and one of Daegu/Osaka/Taipei/Manila/Shanghai), reaching at least five destinations.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/recency: Post-pandemic service to Saipan has been thin, anchored by United’s Guam flights and limited Korea/Japan leisure routes. The linked article highlights ongoing struggles to revive tourism amid flight suspensions, which is bearish for rapid network expansion.\n- High bar: The question requires >4 destinations (at least five). Recent schedules typically include Guam and Seoul; Busan is intermittent/seasonal; Japan service (e.g., Narita) has been uncertain or suspended at times; China/Taiwan/Philippines service has been limited. Reaching five requires multiple concurrent adds.\n- Timing: With ~6 weeks left, most summer 2025 schedules are already published. Late adds are possible but less likely. Even if one new market appears, getting to five requires several.\n- Aggregator nuance: FlightsFrom generally lists scheduled non-stops in the current/seasonal timetable, including seasonal services. That slightly raises the chance if seasonal Korea or Japan routes reappear in July/August, but still needs a confluence of markets to surpass four.\n- Why not higher: Demand recovery remains fragile; small market; airline capacity constrained; policy and safety/weather risks. The requirement (>4) is stringent given current trajectory.\n- Why not lower: There is a non-trivial chance of seasonal Korean secondary-city service (e.g., Busan and possibly another), plus a Japan route resumption (e.g., Narita) or a subsidized/charter-like scheduled service (e.g., Manila or Taipei) appearing in summer schedules and thus listed by FlightsFrom.\n- Up/Down updates: I would move higher on credible airline announcements (e.g., Skymark/JAL/United resuming Narita, Jeju/T’way adding Busan/Daegu, or any China/Taiwan/Philippines route filings) loaded into GDS/aggregators for July–Aug. I would move lower if news confirms continued suspensions/cutbacks from Korea/Japan or if FlightsFrom’s summer view shows only Guam + Seoul close to July.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 4 direct flight destinations from Saipan, Northern Mariana Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Northern Marianas struggles to revive tourism amid flight suspensions and travel restrictions: What you need to know?](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/northern-marianas-struggles-to-revive-tourism-amid-flight-suspensions-and-travel-restrictions-what-you-need-to-know/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 4 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Saipan (SPN)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/SPN) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-20.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
