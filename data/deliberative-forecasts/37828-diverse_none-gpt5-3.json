    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the extremely short window (~40 days) and the lack of pipeline signals (bank mandates, credible leaks, audits/controls chatter) as reasons to keep probabilities low. Forecaster 3 argues the base rate for any random 40‑day window is very low (2–3%) even for mature unicorns; Forecaster 2 stresses the status quo and the need for pre‑signals. One nuance: the resolution requires either a public S‑1 on EDGAR or a post on Rippling’s own news page. That makes the relevant path essentially “public S‑1 within 40 days,” since pre‑S‑1 blog announcements are rare. I find their reasoning largely consistent with my prior, and it nudges me slightly lower on base‑rate grounds and the tight time constraint. No new hard evidence was presented, but the emphasis on the base rate for such a narrow window is persuasive.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is about 40 days. Given typical IPO cadences, a late‑June public S‑1 is possible but uncommon without prior leaks. The blog‑announcement route is unlikely due to standard quiet‑period practice; thus, the event is effectively a public S‑1 by July 1. With no credible reports of imminent filing or banker engagement, and considering many tech issuers target post‑Labor Day windows rather than late June, the conditional likelihood within this window is low. I previously set 9%; incorporating the peers’ base‑rate emphasis and the resolution mechanics, I trim to 7%. I would move up on credible reporting of a public S‑1 timeline or an EDGAR appearance; I would move down if risk‑off markets return or Rippling signals preference for remaining private in 2025.",
