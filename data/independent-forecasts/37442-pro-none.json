    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known with the release of Berkshire Hathaway's 13F filing, which is due by May 15, 2025. As today is May 6, 2025, the outcome will be known in 9 days or less.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo is for Berkshire Hathaway to maintain its previously disclosed position in Domino's Pizza, meaning its Q1 2025 filing would show a holding of 2,382,000 shares or fewer.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 13F filing for the period ending 2025-03-31 is released and reports that Berkshire Hathaway holds a position of 2,382,000 shares or less in Domino's Pizza, Inc. This would mean they either held their position steady or trimmed it during the quarter.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The 13F filing for the period ending 2025-03-31 is released and reports that Berkshire Hathaway holds a position of more than 2,382,000 shares in Domino's Pizza, Inc. This would indicate they actively purchased additional shares during the first quarter of 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the principle of institutional portfolio inertia. Large, long-term investors like Berkshire Hathaway do not frequently adjust their holdings. The most probable action in any given quarter for an established position is no action at all. The fact that my research assistant found no new information supports this status quo-centric view; there are no market rumors or public statements suggesting a change. \n\nThe case for a 'Yes' outcome rests on the possibility that the initial purchase was a 'starter position' being built by one of the portfolio managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler. Domino's, with its strong brand and franchise model, fits the Berkshire Hathaway investment philosophy, so a decision to increase conviction and capital allocation is plausible. \n\nI am not forecasting a higher probability because the base rate of a fund adding to a specific position in a specific quarter is low without a clear catalyst, such as a significant price drop. My forecast is not lower because building a position over several quarters is a common investment strategy, and the thesis for the initial investment likely remains valid. \n\nTo raise my forecast, I would need to see evidence of a significant dip in DPZ's stock price during Q1 2025 or hear market commentary suggesting one of Berkshire's managers was particularly bullish on the company. Conversely, a substantial run-up in the stock price during that period would lead me to lower my forecast.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Domino's Pizza stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nRetailWire: [Domino’s Pizza Stake Purchased by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Group](https://retailwire.com/dominos-pizza-warren-buffett/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 2,382,000 shares of Domino's Pizza, Inc. (ticker symbol DPZ).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
