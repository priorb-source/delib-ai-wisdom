    "review": "The other two forecasters are in complete agreement with my initial analysis, both in their final probability (1%) and in their reasoning. We all identified the same decisive factors: the ongoing civil war has led to a collapse of state institutions, meaning there is no functioning legislature to carry out the legal act of treaty ratification. We also all noted that the extremely short deadline of less than one month makes the necessary preconditions for ratification—a peace deal, the formation of a stable government, and the completion of the formal process—a practical impossibility. Their analyses did not raise any new evidence or arguments I had not considered; rather, they serve as a strong confirmation of the consensus view on this question.",
    "rationale": "I am not updating my forecast. The deliberation with my fellow forecasters has strongly reinforced my initial assessment. The reasoning provided by both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 aligns perfectly with my own, establishing a clear consensus that the probability of Sudan ratifying the AfCFTA before July 1, 2025, is exceptionally low. The core barriers identified by all three of us—the civil war, the absence of a functioning government and legislature, and the critical lack of time—remain the dominant and dispositive factors. The prior work on an implementation strategy is correctly identified by all as irrelevant given the current state of collapse. My 1% forecast already accounts for the minuscule, 'black swan' possibility of a sudden and miraculous peace settlement, which the other forecasters also mentioned. With no new information or counterarguments presented, there is no justification for a change. My confidence in the 'No' outcome remains extremely high.",
