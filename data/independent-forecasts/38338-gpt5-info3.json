  "information": "The field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race has seen recent developments. On June 5, 2025, former Republican Congressman David Jolly announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination. Additionally, State Senator Jason Pizzo has stated his intention to run as an independent. On the Republican side, Congressman Byron Donalds has launched his campaign, and Florida's First Lady, Casey DeSantis, is reportedly considering a run.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 25 days remaining (as of 2025-06-06) until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — no announcement is made by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Morgan continues floating the idea and evaluating the field, but says he’ll decide later (after July 4, late summer, or fall). He keeps up public hints and meetings but makes no explicit candidacy declaration before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Morgan publicly declares he is running for governor (via press conference, social media, or an interview) before July 1, 2025, as either a Democrat or an independent/NPA.",
    "rationale": "Weighting the status quo heavily, a No is more likely over the next ~3.5 weeks. The Politico piece (May 15) indicates serious exploration and a campaign blueprint, but not a commitment or imminent timing signal. Morgan has a history of publicly toying with statewide bids and ultimately passing; there is little structural pressure to announce this early for a 2026 race, especially for a wealthy potential self-funder who can ramp quickly. The calendar matters: many candidates prefer launches after July 4 or later in the summer when attention is higher; this question’s cutoff (July 1) is just before that natural window. Recent field moves (from the research assistant): Democrat David Jolly announced (June 5), Jason Pizzo intends to run as an independent, Byron Donalds launched on the GOP side, and Casey DeSantis is considering. These developments can encourage Morgan to wait and watch how lanes form rather than rush an announcement within weeks. Why not higher: Lack of concrete pre-launch signals (e.g., scheduled events, staff hires leaking, formation of a campaign committee/treasurer, domain/branding rollout) and Morgan’s past pattern of hesitation. Why not lower: He appears genuinely engaged (a public blueprint suggests nontrivial intent), he can self-fund and move fast, and multiple entrants could motivate an earlier-than-expected declaration to shape perceptions. What would move me up: Credible reports of staff hires, a finance chair/treasurer filing at the state level, venue holds for a launch, a stated decision timeline of “in the coming days,” or Morgan signaling he’ll preempt July 4 with news. What would move me down: Morgan publicly deferring a decision to later in the summer, endorsing another Democrat (e.g., Jolly), dismissing a run, or indications of competing priorities that preclude a 2025 announcement.",
