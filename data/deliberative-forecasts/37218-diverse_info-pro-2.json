    "review": "The other two forecasters provided compelling arguments that significantly changed my perspective. Forecaster 2 introduced the most critical point that I had overlooked: Canada's inadmissibility rules for individuals with felony convictions. This legal barrier, requiring a discretionary Temporary Resident Permit (TRP), moves the question from being about logistics and political will to one of legal feasibility and diplomatic sensitivity. This is a much higher and more formal obstacle than I had initially considered. Forecaster 3's analysis, while flawed by an incorrect assumption about Trump's status as a sitting president, beneficially introduced a behavioral baseline. Their points about Trump having just attended the Miami event and his historical pattern of not attending consecutive numbered cards provide strong evidence that even if this event were domestically located, his attendance would be unlikely. I found Forecaster 2's reasoning particularly convincing due to its focus on the concrete, legal barrier to entry. Forecaster 3's base rate and behavioral analysis, once disconnected from their flawed premise, also added valuable context that reinforces a 'No' outcome.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly lowering my forecast from 15% to 5%. My initial analysis focused on logistical and political friction, but I failed to account for the crucial legal barrier identified by Forecaster 2: Donald Trump's felony convictions would likely make him inadmissible to Canada without a special Temporary Resident Permit (TRP). This is not a simple logistical hurdle; it is a formal, discretionary process that would be highly politicized given the strained relationship between Trump and the current Canadian government. The probability of his team applying for, and the Canadian government granting, such a permit for a non-essential event like a UFC fight is extremely low. This legal point is the primary driver of my update. Furthermore, Forecaster 3's observation about Trump's behavioral patterns—specifically, his recent attendance at UFC Miami in April and his history of not attending consecutive numbered cards—provides a secondary, independent reason to doubt his attendance. Even if there were no legal or political barriers, his established pattern makes an appearance unlikely. The combination of a powerful new legal barrier with this reinforcing behavioral evidence overwhelmingly outweighs the factors in favor of attendance, such as his relationship with Dana White. While a surprise is never impossible with Trump, these converging factors make attendance a very remote possibility.",
