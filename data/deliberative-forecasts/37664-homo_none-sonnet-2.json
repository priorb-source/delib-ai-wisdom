    "review": "All three forecasters converge on the core analysis: with only 46 days remaining and zero public signals of Claude 4, the status quo strongly favors No. Forecaster 2 raises the valid point that Claude 3 is 14 months old, which could support a major version release. However, Forecaster 3 makes a particularly compelling argument I had underweighted: Anthropic's recent pattern of incremental updates (Claude 3, then Claude 3.5 Sonnet in June 2024) suggests they may continue with point releases rather than jumping to Claude 4. This is strong evidence against a Claude 4 release in the near term. Forecaster 3's emphasis on this pattern and their lower 8% forecast seems well-justified. Forecaster 2's 18% appears slightly optimistic given the incremental release pattern and complete absence of signals. The tight clustering of forecasts (8-18%) reflects genuine consensus on the fundamentals while disagreeing on degree of optimism about surprise launches.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, Forecaster 3's point about Anthropic's incremental update strategy (3.0 → 3.5) is more significant than I initially weighted. This pattern suggests Anthropic may continue with Claude 3.x versions rather than jumping to 4.0, which reduces the probability further. The complete absence of any signals - no announcements, leaks, documentation updates, or infrastructure changes - remains the strongest evidence. With only 46 days remaining, any launch would need to be coordinated now, and such coordination typically leaves detectable traces. While surprise launches are theoretically possible, they're rare for flagship models requiring extensive safety testing and infrastructure preparation. I'm revising down slightly to account for the incremental release pattern argument, though maintaining a non-trivial probability because the AI industry can move quickly and we lack perfect information about Anthropic's internal plans.",
