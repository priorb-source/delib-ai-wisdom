    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5–6 weeks (the April 2025 trade report is typically released in early June 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — imports roughly flat year over year at about $338B would not exceed the $338.483B threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Nominal imports come in at or below $338.5B because petroleum prices are lower than last year, tariff announcements or uncertainty dampen orders, firms run down inventories, and/or timing/shipping issues shift some arrivals into May.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Imports exceed $338.483B due to solid US consumer and business demand, a strong dollar boosting import volumes, continued recovery in services imports (e.g., Americans’ outbound travel), some pull-forward ahead of prospective tariffs, and/or slightly higher energy prices.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: US nominal imports tend to change slowly and often rise a few percent year over year when domestic demand is solid. April 2024 was $338.483B; a modest 2–4% YoY gain would clear the threshold by $7–14B. Entering spring 2025, the US economy remains relatively resilient, which supports goods imports (consumer goods, autos, capital goods) and services imports (especially travel). A firm US dollar typically supports import volumes. Any pull-forward ahead of possible new tariffs would also push April higher, not lower. These considerations tilt me toward Yes.\nCounterpoints: If crude oil prices in April 2025 are meaningfully below April 2024, that lowers the dollar value of energy imports. If any new tariffs actually took effect by April or materially disrupted ordering, that could trim imports. Inventory normalization or timing effects (shipping delays/rerouting) could also keep April at or below last year’s level. Because the question is a knife-edge around last year’s figure, even small price-level shifts can swing the outcome.\nWhy not higher? Policy uncertainty around potential tariffs, possible softness in goods prices (disinflation, stronger dollar lowering import prices), and energy price downside cap my confidence.\nWhy not lower? The macro backdrop (steady US demand, services import recovery) and potential tariff pull-forward make an outright YoY decline less likely than a modest increase.\nUpdates I’d watch to move the probability: (a) Confirmation of any tariffs actually effective in April/May and their breadth (downward). (b) April petroleum price averages and import price index moves (up or down). (c) High-frequency indicators: port throughput, retailer import volumes, card/travel data (likely upward if strong). (d) Preliminary trade gap estimates from private trackers.\nResearch assistant summary: No additional information available, so the forecast rests on base rates, macro context, and plausible policy timing.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US imports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total amount of imports by the United States for April 2025 reported by the US Census Bureau in its [U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services release](https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/index.html) encompassing that month, exceeds 338,483 million USD.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
