  "information": "The U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Lesotho due to a significant trade imbalance; in 2024, Lesotho exported approximately $237-240 million worth of goods to the U.S., while importing only about $2.8-3 million from the U.S. The tariff is expected to severely impact Lesotho's economy, particularly its textile and apparel industry, which employs around 40,000 workers and constitutes about 90% of the country's manufacturing employment and exports. In response to the tariff, the Lesotho government announced on April 3, 2025, that it was forming a high-level delegation to travel to Washington to negotiate with U.S. authorities and seek clarification on the tariff's rationale.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The 50% tariff, having already been imposed, would remain in effect on the resolution date.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The high-level Lesotho delegation successfully negotiates with U.S. authorities, leading to a rapid reversal or suspension of the tariff. The U.S. government updates the harmonized tariff schedule to reflect a duty rate other than 50% before June 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite Lesotho's diplomatic efforts, negotiations fail, are delayed, or an agreement is not implemented in the official tariff schedule by June 1, 2025, due to the short timeframe and bureaucratic processes. The 50% tariff remains in place.",
    "rationale": "My forecast heavily weights the status quo due to the extremely short timeline. The resolution date is just over a month away, which is a very constrained period for international diplomacy to produce and implement a formal change in U.S. trade policy. The U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) is a complex legal document, and updates, even when politically agreed upon, are subject to bureaucratic procedures that take time. The research assistant's report confirms the tariff is in place and that Lesotho is attempting to negotiate its removal. While Lesotho has a powerful incentive to act quickly due to the severe economic impact, the primary obstacle is procedural and diplomatic inertia on the U.S. side. The default outcome is that the tariff remains unchanged by June 1st.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 85% because there is a non-trivial chance that Lesotho's diplomatic mission succeeds. The tariff's impact is catastrophic for Lesotho, creating immense pressure. A high-level intervention could potentially expedite a policy reversal, especially given the optics of a major economy applying such a punitive tariff to a small, developing nation. \n\nMy forecast is not lower than 85% because the timeline is the single most significant factor. Even with the best of intentions on both sides, scheduling meetings, reaching an agreement, and processing the necessary changes to the HTS before June 1 is a formidable challenge. It is more likely that any potential reversal would be implemented after the resolution date.\n\nI would update my forecast lower (towards No) upon news of imminent high-level talks in Washington or a joint statement indicating progress. I would update higher (towards Yes) if there is news of delays to the delegation's visit or if the U.S. government publicly reaffirms the tariff.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Lesotho as 50% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [How tiny Lesotho ended up with the highest US tariffs in the world](https://apnews.com/article/lesotho-us-trump-tariffs-b337efa47290e889aa076cc9ede7bc9d)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 50% for Lesotho at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=lesotho) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. imposed a 50% tariff on Lesotho due to a significant trade imbalance; in 2024, Lesotho exported approximately $237-240 million worth of goods to the U.S., while importing only about $2.8-3 million from the U.S. The tariff is expected to severely impact Lesotho's economy, particularly its textile and apparel industry, which employs around 40,000 workers and constitutes about 90% of the country's manufacturing employment and exports.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
