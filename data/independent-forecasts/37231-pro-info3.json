  "information": "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has publicly rejected the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) prediction of a 0.3% economic contraction in Mexico for 2025. She stated that the economic models of the Ministry of Finance contradict the IMF's projection and that the government has a strategic plan, known as 'Plan México', to reactivate and strengthen the national economy. As part of this strategy, the president has called on commercial banks to reduce interest rates to promote economic growth.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month. The unemployment data for April 2025 is typically released by Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI) and reported by Trading Economics near the end of May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Mexico's unemployment rate has been on a downward trend and has remained consistently below 3.0% in the preceding months, with recent figures around 2.6%. Extrapolating this recent trend would result in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden economic shock, such as the imposition of significant new US tariffs on key sectors like automotive, leads to immediate supply chain disruptions and layoffs. This, combined with a sharper-than-expected domestic economic slowdown as warned by the IMF, causes a rapid increase in job losses, pushing the unemployment rate to 3.0% or above for April.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Mexican economy maintains its resilience, buoyed by continued foreign investment from nearshoring and stable domestic consumption. The threatened US tariffs are either delayed, not implemented, or their impact is not yet reflected in the April employment data. The labor market remains tight, keeping the unemployment rate well below the 3.0% threshold.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the strong status quo. Mexico's unemployment rate has been solidly below 3.0% for several consecutive months prior to April 2025, providing a significant buffer. Economic data, especially employment figures, exhibit strong inertia, and a major shock would be required to push the rate up by the necessary ~0.4 percentage points in a short period. The primary risk to this forecast, as highlighted in the background information, is the threat of new US tariffs, which could significantly impact Mexico's export-oriented manufacturing sector. Additionally, the IMF's projection of an economic contraction, though disputed by the Mexican government, points to underlying economic fragility. President Sheinbaum's 'Plan México' and calls for lower interest rates are attempts to counteract these headwinds, but their immediate effectiveness is uncertain. My probability is not higher than 75% because the tariff threat and the risk of a slowdown are real and could materialize suddenly, representing a significant source of uncertainty. My probability is not lower because the existing data shows a strong, persistent trend of low unemployment, which is the most powerful single piece of evidence for a near-term forecast. For me to update towards a 'No' outcome, I would need to see concrete steps towards new US tariffs or a sharp, negative turn in high-frequency data like manufacturing PMIs for March or early April. Conversely, an announcement of major new investments or a formal de-escalation of trade tensions would increase my confidence in a 'Yes'.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
