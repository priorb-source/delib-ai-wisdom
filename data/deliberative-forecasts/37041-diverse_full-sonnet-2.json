    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I hadn't fully emphasized. Forecaster 3's observation about the Darién Gap proximity is particularly relevant—Colombia's outbreak areas near Panama's border, combined with heavy cross-border movement, creates a specific transmission pathway I underweighted. The point about epizootic surveillance (NHP die-offs) potentially triggering CDC action before significant human cases is also valuable; I hadn't explicitly considered that yellow fever surveillance includes non-human primate monitoring. Both forecasters strongly emphasize the short timeframe as the primary limiting factor, noting that multiple sequential events (introduction, local transmission, detection, CDC response) must occur within just 38 days. Forecaster 3's clarification that CDC typically issues country-specific Travel Health Notices only when there's evidence of local transmission within that specific country is an important technical detail about how CDC advisories work. However, I notice that while all three of us acknowledge the unprecedented scale of the South American outbreak (cases more than doubled), we may be underweighting this as a true regime change. The combination of disrupted global vaccination programs, proximity through the Darién, and the outbreak's continued growth does create meaningful risk. That said, Panama's 51-year record without human cases and 95%+ vaccination coverage in high-risk areas remains a strong counterfactual.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward from 8% to 7%. The deliberation reinforced that the 38-day timeframe is indeed a significant constraint requiring multiple sequential events. The consensus range of 5-10% appears appropriate given the evidence. I'm staying in the middle-to-lower portion of this range because: (1) the short timeline is genuinely limiting—even with the Darién proximity, introduction, establishment, detection, and CDC advisory issuance in 38 days is challenging; (2) preventive measures are already activated in Panama and Costa Rica; (3) Panama's historical track record is exceptionally strong. However, I'm not going as low as 5% because: (1) the South American outbreak scale is unprecedented for recent years and still growing; (2) the Darién Gap creates a more specific transmission risk than generic geographic proximity; (3) epizootic surveillance means CDC action could be triggered faster than waiting for multiple human cases; (4) Aedes aegypti is widespread in the region. My 7% reflects a small but meaningful probability that rapid spillover could occur, particularly through the Panama-Colombia border region, with detection and CDC response following within the tight timeframe.",
