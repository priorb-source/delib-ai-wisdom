    "review": "Forecaster 2 emphasizes the breadth of what counts as the front page and the WSJ “What’s News” blurbs, which is a fair point and should raise the per‑day inclusion probability, especially for WSJ. However, their 19% Yes implies an extremely low per‑day chance that both omit the word (≈0.6% over 35 days), which seems implausibly low unless tariffs remain the dominant daily A1 theme with the exact word used almost every day by at least one paper. They also don’t grapple with the exact‑word constraint (duties/levies) or topic rotation.\n\nForecaster 3 claims the criteria “have not yet been satisfied” for May 20–26; that isn’t established in the prompt, so I treat it as unverified. Their 35% Yes still assumes a very high per‑day presence of the exact word across at least one paper (both‑omit ≈1.2%), which also seems too low given typical A1 topic churn and wording variation. Both forecasters underweight aggregation over ~35 days and the exact string requirement.\n\nNet: I do slightly heed the WSJ ‘What’s News’ point and the possibility of a sustained tariff cycle, but I don’t find their low probabilities justified quantitatively.",
    "rationale": "Restating the setup: Yes occurs if there is at least one day through June 30 when neither front page includes “tariff(s).” No requires that at least one paper includes the exact word every single remaining day. Let p be the per‑day probability that both omit. The probability of at least one success over n days is 1 − (1 − p)^n. With ~35 days left, even modest p yields high aggregate chances.\n\nReasoning updates:\n- WSJ ‘What’s News’ likely boosts its per‑day inclusion rate; NYT’s is lower and more volatile. The exact‑word constraint (vs. synonyms like duties/levies) reduces inclusion odds.\n- For Forecaster 3’s 35% Yes to hold, p ≈ 1.2%/day; for Forecaster 2’s 19% Yes, p ≈ 0.6%/day. That implies near‑daily recurrence of the exact word on at least one A1, which seems too strong for a month‑plus, even in a hot policy cycle.\n- Unverified claims about the first week having no qualifying days are weak evidence; zero successes in 6–7 trials is not unusual even if p is, say, 5–10%.\n\nDirectional risks: If WSJ indeed uses “tariff(s)” almost daily in ‘What’s News’ and NYT uses it frequently too, my probability should be lower. Conversely, any stretch where one paper consistently avoids the exact word or shifts to synonyms quickly pushes the event to Yes.\n\nGiven the counterarguments, I modestly trim my prior to reflect the possibility of sustained WSJ usage but still view a Yes as more likely than not due to aggregation over many days and wording variability.",
