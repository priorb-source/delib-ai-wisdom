  "information": "The drought has caused significant ecological and public safety consequences. The Everglades is experiencing its worst drought in 13 years, causing some areas to dry up completely, which has led to the suspension of tourism activities like airboat tours. As of early May 2025, elevated fire risk resulted in over 100 active wildfires burning more than 3,600 acres of vegetation. In response to the dry conditions, at least 21 counties have issued burn bans.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "One month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. As of late April and early May 2025, reports indicate that 14 million Florida residents are already under drought conditions, meeting the threshold for a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Florida summer wet season begins early and with unusual intensity in June. Widespread, sustained, and heavy rainfall across the state's most populous areas rapidly replenishes soil moisture and water levels, causing the U.S. Drought Monitor to revise its assessment and list fewer than 14.0 million residents in drought by June 28, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The summer wet season begins on time or is slightly delayed, and its initial rainfall is not sufficient to reverse the severe drought conditions established during the spring. The number of residents living in drought-affected areas remains at or above the 14.0 million threshold on the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the status quo. The research provided indicates that the 14.0 million resident threshold has already been met as of late April/early May 2025. With only one month until the resolution date, the persistence of this existing condition is the most likely outcome. Florida's climate is transitioning from its typically dry spring to its wet summer season. While this seasonal shift is the primary factor that could lead to a 'No' outcome, it is unlikely to reverse a severe drought across such a large population in just 30-60 days. Drought conditions have significant inertia; it takes sustained, above-average rainfall to meaningfully replenish groundwater and surface water, not just a few thunderstorms. The current situation, described as the worst in the Everglades in 13 years with numerous wildfires, underscores the severity and suggests a rapid reversal is improbable. My forecast is not higher than 85% because the onset of the wet season introduces genuine uncertainty. An unusually early, wet start to the rainy season or an early-season tropical system could deliver enough widespread precipitation to push the number below the threshold. My forecast is not lower than 85% because the starting point is a confirmed 14 million people affected, and overcoming the inertia of such a widespread drought in a single month is a high bar. I would lower my probability if weather models in the next two weeks consistently forecasted a significantly wetter-than-average June across Florida's major population centers. Conversely, I would raise my probability if forecasters predicted a delayed or weak start to the summer rainy season.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe drought has caused significant ecological and public safety consequences. The Everglades is experiencing its worst drought in 13 years, causing some areas to dry up completely, which has led to the suspension of tourism activities like airboat tours. As of early May 2025, elevated fire risk resulted in over 100 active wildfires burning more than 3,600 acres of vegetation. In response to the dry conditions, at least 21 counties have issued burn bans.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
