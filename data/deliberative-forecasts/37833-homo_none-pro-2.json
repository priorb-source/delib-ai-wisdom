    "review": "My initial forecast of 8% is strongly corroborated by Forecaster 2, who arrived at the same probability for nearly identical reasons: the low base rate, the strictness of the 'exact phrase' resolution criteria, and the known linguistic habits of both individuals (e.g., Trump's preference for 'visa lottery'). Forecaster 3's analysis introduces a critical point of divergence: the interpretation of the timeline. They correctly identify that if the start date were in 2024, the presidential election would be a massive catalyst significantly increasing the probability. However, the prompt I was given explicitly states 'Today is 2025-05-22'. I must adhere to the prompt as written. Therefore, Forecaster 3's central argument, while logically sound for a 13-month forecast period, is not applicable to the ~6-week period I am assessing. Their analysis does not convince me to change my forecast, as it is based on a different premise of the question's timeframe.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 8%. The deliberation has reinforced my original reasoning rather than challenging it. The primary factor influencing this forecast is the extremely short timeframe between the stated start date (May 22, 2025) and the resolution date (before July 1, 2025). Within this roughly six-week window, the probability of any specific, non-trending phrase being tweeted by one of two specific individuals is inherently low. This is compounded by the strict resolution criteria requiring the exact words 'diversity visa'. As Forecaster 2 and I both noted, this is not the preferred terminology for Donald Trump, who has a well-established history of using the term 'visa lottery' instead. While Elon Musk's commentary is less predictable, his focus has generally not been on this specific program. The main catalyst identified by Forecaster 3—the 2024 presidential election—is a past event in this timeline, so its powerful influence is absent. My 8% forecast already accounts for the small chance of an unforeseen news event or political debate specifically highlighting the 'diversity visa' program, which could prompt a reactive tweet from either individual. The arguments presented in the deliberation, when filtered through the lens of the specific dates in the prompt, support a low probability.",
