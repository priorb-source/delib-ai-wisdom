    "review": "My initial forecast of 18% was identical to Forecaster 2's, and our reasoning was very similar, focusing on the large currency move required in a short period versus the significant tail risks from US economic weakness and trade policy. Both analyses correctly identified the core tension. However, Forecaster 3's analysis was more rigorous and convincing, causing me to update my view. Forecaster 3 introduced two crucial arguments I had not sufficiently weighed: 1) The European Central Bank (ECB) is widely expected to cut interest rates in June, creating a policy divergence with the Fed that acts as a major headwind against Euro appreciation. 2) The threat of US tariffs specifically on the EU is likely to be more damaging to the Eurozone economy, potentially leading to USD strength relative to the EUR, the opposite of what is needed for a 'Yes' outcome. This is a more nuanced and persuasive take on the tariff risk than my initial one. These arguments substantially lower the probability of the required 9.5% dollar depreciation.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 18% to 12%. My initial analysis was based on the low probability of a large currency move in a short timeframe, balanced against tail risks from a weakening US economy and trade threats. While the core of this reasoning remains, the deliberation with other forecasters highlighted two significant factors that make the 'Yes' outcome even less likely. First, as Forecaster 3 pointed out, the ECB's expected rate cut in June puts its policy on a divergent path from the US Federal Reserve. This policy differential will act as a strong headwind, suppressing the Euro's value and making the required rally towards 1.25 EUR/USD much more difficult to achieve. Second, I am now convinced that my initial interpretation of the tariff risk was too simplistic. Tariffs specifically targeting the EU would likely harm the Eurozone economy more than the US economy, leading to a weaker Euro relative to the dollar, thereby moving the exchange rate *away* from the threshold. These two factors significantly raise the bar for a 'Yes' outcome; it would now likely require a severe, US-centric shock (like a financial crisis flare-up or a series of disastrous economic data prints) to overwhelm these headwinds. My updated forecast of 12% reflects a lower probability for this tail-risk scenario.",
