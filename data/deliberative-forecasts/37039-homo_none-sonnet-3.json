    "review": "All three forecasters converge on similar reasoning: the NYT article provides evidence of policy action, the timeline is feasible, but the specificity requirement creates uncertainty. Forecaster 2 (65%) emphasizes status quo bias toward implementation, while Forecaster 3 (45%) is more conservative about assuming implementation without confirmation. The most compelling new argument is Forecaster 3's emphasis on the 20-day information gap and the multiple alignment requirements (exact rate, exact date, exact subheading). Forecaster 3 correctly notes that we lack confirmation of current implementation status - we don't know if 31% is already codified, just announced, or merely reported. This is a critical point I underweighted. However, Forecaster 3 may be too conservative given the question's extreme specificity strongly suggests it's based on actual policy announcements rather than hypothetical speculation. The question writer wouldn't ask about such precise details (31%, subheading 9903.01.60, June 1) without some basis. Forecaster 2's status quo bias argument has merit but assumes more certainty about implementation than our limited information warrants.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I'm moderating my forecast downward slightly. The key insight from this deliberation is recognizing the difference between 'Switzerland is being targeted with tariffs' (well-supported by NYT) versus 'exactly 31% will appear on exactly June 1 in exactly that subheading' (requires multiple precise conditions). Each condition introduces failure probability: the rate could be 30% or 32% after negotiations; implementation could occur May 15 or June 15 due to procedural timing; a different subheading could be used. Without confirmation that these exact parameters are already locked in, I should be more uncertain. However, I'm not moving as low as 45% because the question's precise construction suggests the forecaster has access to specific policy information, not just general news. The 58-day window from announcement to June 1 falls within typical 30-90 day implementation periods. Balancing these factors, I'm adjusting to 55% - acknowledging the valid specificity concerns while maintaining that the question's precision likely reflects real policy details.",
