  "information": "Following the March 2025 Greenlandic parliamentary elections, the Demokraatit party, which advocates for a gradual path to independence, emerged as the winner. The new Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, favors incremental autonomy and has emphasized economic development. While the more staunchly pro-independence Naleraq party doubled its number of parliamentary seats, it remains in the opposition. The government has initiated some formal steps, including the presentation of a draft constitution in May 2023 and the formation of a commission under the Self-Government Act to handle independence negotiations; this commission has been given a multi-year mandate.\n\nPublic sentiment in Greenland shows strong support for the principle of independence, with various polls indicating approval from over 80% of the population. However, opinions on the timing vary, with many favoring a more gradual approach. A January 2025 survey revealed that while 84% support independence, 45% of supporters would reconsider if it meant a decline in living standards. The debate over independence has been recently intensified by comments from former U.S. President Donald Trump about acquiring the island, which also prompted a solidarity visit from Danish King Frederik X in late April 2025 and a visit from a U.S. private sector delegation exploring investment opportunities.\n\nGreenland's economy is substantially dependent on an annual block grant from Denmark, which amounts to approximately 4.3 billion Danish kroner and makes up about half of the government's budget. The current government's stated priority is to develop Greenland's mineral resources to build economic self-sufficiency before moving toward political independence. The 2009 Self-Government Act provides the legal basis for Greenland to declare independence through a referendum. Past referendums, such as those in 1979 and 2008, had significantly longer preparation and lead times than the period before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, with a deadline of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current Greenlandic government continues its gradualist approach, focusing on economic development and constitutional groundwork without announcing a specific date for an independence referendum.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Demokraatit-led government adheres to its election platform of prioritizing economic self-sufficiency before political independence. The government uses the multi-year mandate of its independence commission as justification for a deliberate, long-term process, and no referendum date is announced before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under intense pressure from the emboldened Naleraq opposition party and a surge in public demand, the government makes a strategic political move. To appease independence advocates, they officially announce a referendum date set several years in the future (e.g., 2030), satisfying the question's criteria without committing to an immediate vote.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong alignment between the current government's official platform, the underlying economic realities, and the very short timeframe. The governing Demokraatit party won the recent election on a platform of gradual independence, with a stated focus on economic development to reduce reliance on the substantial Danish block grant. This grant constitutes about half of the government's budget, making immediate independence economically precarious, a concern shared by a significant portion of the electorate. The establishment of a commission with a multi-year mandate further signals a deliberate, not rushed, process. The historical precedent for major referendums in Greenland also indicates much longer lead times than the less than two months remaining before the deadline. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because political dynamics can be unpredictable. The pro-independence Naleraq party has increased its influence, and heightened international attention could create unforeseen pressure. The government might make a symbolic concession by announcing a referendum for a distant future date to manage this pressure, which would resolve the question as 'Yes'.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 5% because the fundamental factors point overwhelmingly towards 'No'. For the government to reverse its core policy so soon after an election, without a dramatic change in economic circumstances, would be a major and unlikely political event. The status quo is a slow, methodical path toward independence, and a referendum announcement in the next seven weeks is not part of that path. I would increase my forecast if key figures in the governing coalition began publicly calling for a referendum date or if major, unanticipated economic news (like a massive resource contract) were to be announced.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Greenland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Greenland's independence gradualists win election amid Trump control pledge](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-election-tests-independence-ambitions-us-interest-looms-2025-03-11/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Greenland from the Denmark is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Greenland. Please note that broader legality, such as it being overturned by the government of Denmark, will be considered irrelevant for this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nFollowing the March 2025 Greenlandic parliamentary elections, the Demokraatit party, which advocates for a gradual path to independence, emerged as the winner.
