  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1.5 months, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Claude 4 is currently in development and not publicly available. Without a significant acceleration of its release schedule, it will not be launched by the deadline.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic continues its development of Claude 4, adhering to an internal release schedule planned for the second half of 2025, consistent with external reporting. They prioritize further safety testing and performance enhancements over an early release, and July 1, 2025 passes without a public launch.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by intense competitive pressure from rivals such as OpenAI or Google, Anthropic accelerates its timeline and launches Claude 4 to the general public in late June 2025. This launch serves as a strategic move to preempt a competitor's anticipated summer release.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the available reporting which suggests a release 'later in 2025'. As of today, May 16, a release before July 1 would be considered 'mid-2025' at best, not 'later'. The status quo is that the model is not released, and major product launches of this scale are often delayed rather than released ahead of schedule. The description of Claude 4 as a complex hybrid model further suggests that a rapid, imminent release is less likely, as development and robust safety testing would require significant time. The resolution criteria are also strict, requiring full public availability without a waitlist, which typically follows a period of early access or beta testing. Thus, even if an early access version were released in June, it would not trigger a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 15% because the AI industry is extremely volatile and competitive. A surprise release cannot be entirely ruled out as a strategic move by Anthropic to gain a competitive edge. Timelines can be fluid, and the existing reports could be outdated or deliberately conservative. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because the window for a release is very narrow, at just over six weeks. A launch of this magnitude would typically be preceded by more concrete rumors, official announcements, or at least a developer preview, none of which have occurred. The current evidence points strongly towards a release in Q3 or Q4 2025.\n\nI would increase my probability forecast upon seeing credible leaks of an imminent release or an official announcement from Anthropic scheduling a launch event in June. Conversely, I would decrease it if Anthropic makes any statement confirming a release in the second half of the year.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA February 2025 report from Sina Finance described plans for Claude 4 to be a hybrid model combining a general-purpose model with a reasoning model, which would allow users to adjust the computational resources used for a given task.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
