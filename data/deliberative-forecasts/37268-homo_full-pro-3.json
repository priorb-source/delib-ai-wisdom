    "review": "The deliberation reveals a consensus on the central conflict: Muqtada al-Sadr's firm, recent statements boycotting the election versus his documented history of dramatic reversals. We all identify the May 4, 2025, alliance registration deadline as a critical, imminent barrier. The primary point of divergence is the weight given to Sadr's general unpredictability against the structural and temporal constraints of the question. Forecaster 2 assigns a higher probability (25%), emphasizing this unpredictability. Forecaster 3 and I both arrived at 15%, and their reasoning strongly aligns with my own. Specifically, Forecaster 3's point that Sadr's past reversals (e.g., August for the October 2021 election) tend to occur closer to the election date is a compelling argument that any potential U-turn this cycle would likely happen after this question's July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am maintaining my initial probability of 15%. The deliberation has strengthened my conviction. The reasoning provided by Forecaster 3, in particular, mirrors my own and adds a useful clarification regarding the timing of Sadr's previous U-turns. The fact that his 2021 reversal came in August, just two months before the election, establishes a clear precedent. Applying that timeline to the November 2025 election suggests a potential reversal would most likely occur in August or September 2025, well after this question resolves. This historical pattern, combined with the major structural barrier of the May 4 alliance registration deadline (which is less than 24 hours from the date of this forecast), makes an announcement of participation before July 1 highly unlikely. While I acknowledge Forecaster 2's point about Sadr's inherent unpredictability, I believe that for this specific, time-bound question, his past behavioral patterns and the immediate logistical hurdles are stronger indicators than his general reputation for volatility. My 15% forecast accounts for the non-zero chance of an unexpectedly early political development forcing his hand, but the balance of evidence points firmly towards him maintaining his boycott past the July 1 deadline to maximize leverage.",
