    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points worth examining. Forecaster 2 introduces specific timeline data - a mean closure of 45 days and median of 70 days - which they claim comes from the research assistant. However, I don't see these specific figures in the research report I received, which makes me cautious about relying on them. That said, their core logic is sound: if the median is around 70 days and our deadline is 68 days, we should be approaching 50% probability. Forecaster 3 raises an excellent point I underweighted: frozen products make recovery verification more difficult because items can remain in consumer freezers for extended periods. This is a meaningful negative factor that extends recall timelines beyond just the logistical retrieval phase. Both forecasters land in the 38-42% range, making my 30% the outlier.\n\nThe convergence around 38-42% suggests I may have been overly pessimistic about bureaucratic timelines. The limited geographic scope (NY only) really is a significant accelerating factor that all three of us recognize. However, I remain somewhat more cautious than the others because: (1) the base rate data strongly suggests 60-120+ days for typical recalls, (2) we're only 11 days into a process that needs to complete in 68 total days, and (3) the frozen product verification concern that Forecaster 3 raised is legitimate and extends timelines.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I'm updating upward but remaining more conservative than the group consensus. The key insight from Forecaster 2 about being near the median closure time (if 70 days is accurate) is compelling and suggests I was too pessimistic. The limited geographic scope remains the strongest positive factor. However, I'm weighting three concerns more heavily than the others: (1) frozen products genuinely complicate verification as Forecaster 3 noted, (2) base rate data from typical recalls suggests 60-120+ days is normal, and (3) I cannot verify Forecaster 2's claim about a 45-day mean, making me hesitant to fully embrace that optimistic data point. The bureaucratic verification processes at FSIS are notoriously methodical, and even with favorable factors, 68 days total is compressed. I'm moving from 30% to 36%, acknowledging the other forecasters' valid points about the limited scope and near-median timing, while maintaining skepticism about whether this particular recall can beat typical timelines.",
