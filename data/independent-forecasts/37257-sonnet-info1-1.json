  "information": "As of early May 2025, Republika Srpska (RS) has taken several legislative and political steps. A draft for a new constitution, which includes rights to self-determination and provisions for confederal relationships, completed its public consultation phase in mid-April 2025. The RS government has also passed laws to ban Bosnia's central judicial, police, and intelligence agencies from operating within its territory. Milorad Dodik, the leader of RS, has stated he is willing to declare independence if the central authorities, with international support, attempt to take control of RS property. Similarly, Nenad Stevanović, President of the RS Parliament, warned that continued pressure would lead to a declaration of independence, stating that RS is a functional entity capable of implementing its decisions independently.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 60 days remain until the July 1, 2025 deadline",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - no official announcement of a referendum date",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite escalating rhetoric and legislative preparations, Republika Srpska leadership continues using the threat of an independence referendum as a negotiating tactic but stops short of officially scheduling one. International pressure, practical constraints, or the strategic value of maintaining ambiguity prevent them from setting an actual date before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to perceived provocations from the central Bosnian government or international community, or as a strategic escalation, Milorad Dodik or another authorized RS official formally announces a specific date for an independence referendum. Given the completed constitutional consultation and recent aggressive legislation, this announcement could occur with little warning within the next two months.",
    "rationale": "The groundwork for a potential referendum has been extensively laid. The draft constitution completed public consultation in mid-April 2025, RS has passed laws banning central government agencies from its territory, and leaders like Dodik and Stevanović have explicitly threatened independence. These are significant concrete steps beyond mere rhetoric. However, crucial gap exists between preparation and actually scheduling a referendum - a major escalation with serious international consequences. Status quo bias suggests most threats don't immediately materialize. Historically, entities like RS often use referendum threats as negotiating leverage rather than immediately executing them. With only 60 days remaining, if scheduling were imminent, we might expect clearer signals. The probability is elevated above baseline (15-20%) due to recent aggressive actions and completed preparations, but remains below 50% because: (1) no date has been announced despite ample opportunity, (2) international pressure would be severe, (3) the threat may be more valuable than execution as a bargaining tool, and (4) status quo typically prevails in the short term. For me to increase my forecast, I would need: explicit statements about referendum timing, intensification of central government intervention attempts, or clear Russian encouragement. For me to decrease it: diplomatic breakthroughs, de-escalatory statements from RS leadership, or successful international mediation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Republika Srpska officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nFair Observer: [Balkan Tinderbox: How Russia’s Moves Could Reignite Bosnia](https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/balkan-tinderbox-how-russias-moves-could-reignite-bosnia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Republika Srpska. Please note that broader legality, such as within Bosnia and Herzegovina, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the Bosnian government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early May 2025, Republika Srpska (RS) has taken several legislative and political steps.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
