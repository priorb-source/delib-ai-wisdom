  "information": "On May 21, 2025, Kneecap member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (also known as Mo Chara) was charged with a terrorism-related offence under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000. The charge relates to an allegation that he displayed a Hezbollah flag during a concert in London in November 2024. A court date at Westminster Magistrates' Court has been set for June 18, 2025, approximately one week before the Glastonbury festival is scheduled to begin. The band has publicly denied the charge, describing it as 'political policing'.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police's Counter Terrorism Command is formally investigating the band over footage from two separate events. One investigation concerns a video from a 2024 concert where a band member allegedly said, 'The only good Tory is a dead Tory. Kill your local MP.' Another investigation relates to a 2023 concert where a band member appeared to chant, 'up Hamas, up Hezbollah.' Following public backlash, the band issued an apology to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess. Several UK politicians and government ministers have publicly called for Glastonbury to remove Kneecap from the festival's lineup.\n\nAs of late May 2025, Kneecap remains officially listed on the Glastonbury 2025 lineup for the West Holts stage, and festival organizers have not issued any public statement regarding the controversies or the recent charge. Several venues and European festivals, including the Eden Project, Plymouth Pavilions, and Germany's Hurricane and Southside festivals, have cancelled Kneecap's scheduled appearances. However, other events have proceeded; London's Wide Awake Festival confirmed the band would still perform on May 24, and the band played a surprise gig in London on May 22, the day after the terrorism charge was made public.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33-37 days until Glastonbury 2025 begins (June 25-29). The outcome will be definitively known by early July 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Kneecap remains officially listed on the Glastonbury 2025 lineup for the West Holts stage with no statement from festival organizers about removal.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury organizers remove Kneecap from the lineup due to political pressure, or the June 18 court hearing results in bail conditions preventing Mo Chara from performing, or security concerns/UK entry restrictions prevent the band from appearing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Glastonbury maintains its current position and does not remove Kneecap from the lineup despite political pressure. The court hearing on June 18 either results in bail conditions that allow performance, or proceedings are delayed. The band performs as scheduled during June 25-29.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. Kneecap is officially on the lineup and Glastonbury has issued no statement about removal despite significant controversy. This is crucial because Glastonbury has a well-established reputation for progressive politics and historically has not yielded to pressure from conservative politicians. The festival's political identity makes them ideologically aligned with maintaining artistic freedom even amid controversy.\n\nRecent evidence supports their ability to perform: they played a surprise gig on May 22 (one day after the terrorism charge) and Wide Awake Festival confirmed their May 24 performance would proceed. This demonstrates they are not currently banned from performing in the UK and can operate despite the charge.\n\nThe terrorism charge is serious but presents manageable risk. It relates to allegedly displaying a Hezbollah flag at a 2024 concert - not violence or planning. Terrorism prosecutions typically take months or years, and bail is standard for such charges. While the June 18 court date is close to Glastonbury, it will likely result in bail conditions rather than detention. Any restrictions would need to be extraordinarily severe to prevent performance.\n\nSome venues have cancelled (Eden Project, Plymouth Pavilions, German festivals), showing real commercial and reputational risk. However, Glastonbury operates at a different scale and with different values than smaller, more risk-averse venues.\n\nWhy not higher (>85%): The terrorism charge creates genuine legal uncertainty. Restrictive bail conditions could theoretically prevent travel or public performance. The proximity of the court date (7 days before the festival) creates timing risk. Political pressure, while unlikely to move Glastonbury, is unprecedented in scale for this band. Unexpected developments could still occur.\n\nWhy not lower (<70%): The status quo is powerful - changing a major festival lineup weeks before the event is operationally difficult and politically costly for Glastonbury. The band's ability to perform elsewhere currently demonstrates no immediate legal barrier. Glastonbury's ideological stance strongly favors maintaining the booking. Only 33 days remain until the festival, making major changes increasingly unlikely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kneecap perform at Glastonbury 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Kneecap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecap_\\(band\\)) are an Irish band who have significantly risen in popularity since their formation in 2017.&#x20;\n\nThe band is a trio consisting of: \"Mo Chara\" (Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh), \"Móglaí Bap\" (Naoise Ó Caireallain), and \"DJ Próvaí\" (J. J. Ó Dochartaigh) whose songs consist of rap in a mixture of Irish Gaelic and English giving them a unique style.\n\nNamed after a [torture technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneecapping) made infamous by the Irish Republican Army, the group are no stranger to controversies. Whilst most have been minor - complaints about profanity, drug use, violence in their songs, music videos and concerts, and promotion of Irish Republicanism - the band have come under a large amount of controversy resulting in cancelled performances which initially stemmed from a Coachcella performance where the band, \"described Israel's military action in Gaza as a US-funded genocide\".&#x20;\n\nOn top of this, [two reports were made](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cly5r4gg7l6o) to the UK Metropolitan police:\n\n> \\[...] the band allegedly call for the death of Conservative MPs. Another seems to show a band member shouting \"up Hamas, up Hezbollah\". Both groups are banned in the UK and it is a crime to express support for them.\n\n> \\[...]\n\n> They claimed that footage where they appeared to say \"the only good Tory is a dead Tory\" had been \"taken out of all context\", and apologised for the hurt caused to the families of murdered MPs Jo Cox and Sir David Amess.\n\nThe band are [due](https://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/line-up/) to play at Glastonbury 2025 - the UK's largest and most prestigious music festival - however there have been [calls](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2025/04/30/kneecap-should-be-banned-full-stop-after-dead-tories-video/) for the band to be removed from the lineup.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Kneecap officially performs at Glastonbury 2025, scheduled for June 25 to June 29, 2025.\n\n* If Glastonbury 2025 does not take place before September 1, 2025 this question will be **annulled**.\n* Officially perform is defined as a planned performance as allowed by the festival organisers.\n* Any official performance is considered sufficient for this question. If, for example, one band member is banned from the festival, the question will still resolve as **Yes** if the other member(s) perform under the name Kneecap.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn May 21, 2025, Kneecap member Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh (also known as Mo Chara) was charged with a terrorism-related offence under Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
