    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — recent patterns suggest Shigeru Ishiba’s approval is slightly higher than Keir Starmer’s, and ties also resolve to No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Morning Consult shows Ishiba’s approval equal to or above Starmer’s when Metaculus checks on/after July 1, 2025 (including a tie). Given typical ranges, Ishiba remains in the high-30s/low-40s while Starmer sits mid-to-high 30s.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starmer gets a modest late-June bump (e.g., favorable headlines or international event visibility) or Ishiba sees a dip (e.g., economic/yen volatility or LDP-related negative news), leaving Starmer’s trailing 7-day average a few points higher than Ishiba’s on the July 1 snapshot.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline levels and inertia: Morning Consult’s 7-day moving average dampens short-term volatility, so a 1-month horizon heavily favors the status quo. Historically, UK PM approval tends to run in the 30s and often net-negative; Japan’s PMs can start higher then drift down. Since Ishiba is still relatively new, a plausible status quo is high-30s/low-40s; Starmer is more likely mid-to-high 30s. That points slightly toward No.\n- Tie-break rule: Ties resolve to No, shaving a few percentage points off the Yes likelihood.\n- Volatility over a month: Leader approvals on Morning Consult typically move only a few points month-to-month absent major shocks. If Ishiba is a few points ahead now, Starmer needs either a positive swing or an Ishiba slide to flip the ordering within ~4 weeks.\n- Event risk: Potential movers before July 1 include Japanese economic news (yen weakness/BoJ shifts) that could nick Ishiba, or favorable international/diplomatic visibility for Starmer that could nudge him up. However, absent a clear, known catalyst, base rates suggest small moves.\n- Why not higher: The combination of (a) likely current Ishiba edge, (b) short runway, and (c) tie-resolves-No all push against a Yes.\n- Why not lower: Japanese PM approval can erode quickly on economic jitters; a minor scandal or sharp yen move could drop Ishiba a few points, and Starmer could pick up a modest late-June boost. Either would be enough to flip a narrow gap.\n- What would change my view upward: A new Morning Consult weekly showing Starmer already equal or ahead; clear UK positive developments boosting his standing; or a fresh Japan-specific negative shock (notably yen turmoil or LDP funding headlines) reducing Ishiba’s approval.\n- What would change my view downward: Confirmation that Ishiba currently holds a lead of ~5+ points; a UK domestic stumble for Starmer; or a stabilizing/positive economic narrative in Japan that props up Ishiba’s ratings.\n\nResearch assistant summary: No additional data was provided; forecast relies on cross-country base rates, typical approval ranges, and expected short-term inertia in Morning Consult’s 7-day averages.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
