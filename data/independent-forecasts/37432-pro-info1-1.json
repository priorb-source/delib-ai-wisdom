  "information": "In Ohio, Republican lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 153 (SB 153), which would create new requirements for citizen-led ballot initiatives. The bill would compel paid signature gatherers to wear visible badges, list employers on petitions, and maintain detailed records. The bill's definition of 'paid' circulators is considered broad, and it requires petition signers to be registered voters on the exact day they sign. As of early May 2025, this bill had not completed the legislative process. In February 2025, a provision requiring Ohioans to prove citizenship to register to vote at the Bureau of Motor Vehicles was removed from the state's transportation budget by Republicans. Instead, BMV employees will be prohibited from offering registration forms to individuals identified as non-citizens. This change was prompted by a report from Secretary of State Frank LaRose indicating that non-citizens were accidentally registering to vote, partly due to language barriers.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new legislation expanding voter citizenship verification requirements is enacted by the deadline. The question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Ohio General Assembly prioritizes other legislative items before its summer recess and does not bring a relevant bill to a full vote in both chambers. The recent removal of a similar provision from the transportation budget reflects a lack of consensus or political will within the Republican caucus to pursue this specific policy before the deadline, and this attitude persists.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to renewed political pressure or a high-profile incident, Republican legislative leaders attach an amendment requiring proof of citizenship for voting to a must-pass bill. Using their supermajority, they expedite its passage through both the House and Senate in the final weeks of June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong evidence of recent legislative inaction on this specific issue, despite the Republican party's supermajority control of the Ohio General Assembly. The most influential piece of information is that in February 2025, Republican lawmakers actively removed a provision from the state's transportation budget that would have required proof of citizenship to register to vote at the BMV. Instead, they opted for a less burdensome procedural change. This action provides a clear signal that, when recently presented with an opportunity to enact such a requirement, the majority party declined. This 'revealed preference' is a much stronger indicator of their current intent than general party platform positions. Furthermore, with less than two months until the July 1, 2025 deadline, the legislative calendar is tight. Passing a new, potentially controversial piece of legislation from start to finish is challenging in this timeframe. While the Republican supermajority certainly has the power to pass such a law, their recent decision not to do so weighs heavily against the likelihood of a reversal in the immediate future. The probability is not lower than 10% because the political environment is dynamic. Republican control is absolute, and if leadership decided to make this a priority, they could use procedural maneuvers to pass it quickly, perhaps as an amendment to an unrelated bill. My forecast would increase if a bill containing this provision passes a committee in either chamber or if key leaders publicly commit to its passage before the deadline. It would decrease if legislative leaders state it is not a priority for this session or if they adjourn without taking up the issue.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Ohio, Republican lawmakers introduced Senate Bill 153 (SB 153), which would create new requirements for citizen-led ballot initiatives.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
