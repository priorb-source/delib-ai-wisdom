  "information": "A Russian delegation is scheduled to visit Istanbul on June 2, 2025, for a second round of peace talks with Ukraine. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitriy Peskov stated that a high-level summit involving President Trump would depend on the achievement of results from these direct talks between the two delegations. Russia proposed the June 2 date, following a previous meeting on May 16. The United States will not send an official delegation, but White House press secretary Caroline Levitt said, 'We will let you know if the President has plans to send a representative.'",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 31 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The June 2 Istanbul talks yield limited progress or plan a follow-on summit in a neutral country or after July 1. The White House does not announce Russia travel, and Trump’s June schedule fills with domestic priorities.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The June 2 talks produce a breakthrough and both sides rapidly arrange a late-June signing ceremony in Moscow or St. Petersburg, prompting an unusually fast, high-profile presidential visit.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and planning realities: US presidential visits to Russia are rare and normally planned and announced with some lead time. With only a month left, the default is no visit. Secretive last-minute trips by a US president to Russia are especially unlikely given security, protocol, and political sensitivities.\n- Diplomacy/context: US-Russia relations remain strained amid the Ukraine war. Even with Trump’s atypical diplomatic style, a rapid presidential trip to Russia would be domestically contentious and diplomatically complex. If there is a breakthrough, high-level meetings are more plausibly held in neutral venues (e.g., Turkey, Switzerland, Nordic states) rather than Russia, especially on short notice.\n- Research assistant input: A Russian delegation meets Ukraine in Istanbul on June 2 (second round), and Kremlin spokesman Peskov said any high-level summit involving President Trump depends on results from those talks. The White House said the US will not send an official delegation on June 2 and did not commit to sending a representative. This supports the view that a near-term Trump trip is not currently in train; a Russia-based summit would require a decisive breakthrough plus rapid coordination.\n- Why not higher: Very limited time window; lack of public signals of imminent travel; strong incentives to use neutral ground; high security/optics hurdles.\n- Why not lower: Trump could pursue an unconventional, high-visibility move if a genuine breakthrough emerges, and Russia might strongly prefer home turf for optics.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting or official signals of a summit in Russia in June; concrete post-Istanbul readouts indicating Moscow as the venue; White House advance teams or NOTAMs/logistics pointing to a Russia stop.\n- What would move me down: Istanbul talks falter; announcement of any follow-on summit outside Russia or scheduled for July or later; explicit White House denial of Russia travel in June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump visit Russia before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [List of international presidential trips made by Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_presidential_trips_made_by_Donald_Trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, President Donald Trump personally visits Russia.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA Russian delegation is scheduled to visit Istanbul on June 2, 2025, for a second round of peace talks with Ukraine. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitriy Peskov stated that a high-level summit involving President Trump would depend on the achievement of results from these direct talks between the two delegations.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
