    "review": "My initial forecast of 95% was in exact agreement with Forecaster 2, with both of us emphasizing the power of bureaucratic inertia over the very short (~6 week) remaining timeframe. We both acknowledged the small risk of a politically motivated, symbolic change to the website. Forecaster 3 arrived at a lower forecast of 85%, presenting a similar overall rationale but assigning a significantly higher probability to the 'symbolic change' scenario. Their key argument, which I found convincing, was that since the resolution criteria are based *only* on the text of the webpage, the normal, lengthy process for policy and regulatory changes is not a barrier. A new administration could order this cosmetic change as a low-cost, high-visibility signal of its policy intentions. This argument highlights a vulnerability in my initial reasoning which perhaps over-weighted the importance of the underlying policy process and under-weighted the possibility of a purely messaging-based action.",
    "rationale": "I am slightly decreasing my forecast confidence in a 'Yes' outcome. The deliberation with the other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 3, has convinced me that I was underestimating the probability of a new administration making a purely symbolic change to the website's text. The argument that such an action is an 'easy win' that signals intent without requiring the lengthy rulemaking process is compelling. The resolution criteria's specific focus on the phrase 'snack foods' makes this a real risk. However, I am not lowering my forecast to 85%. I maintain that even symbolic changes require focus and political capital, both of which are in high demand and spread across countless priorities in the first six months of a new administration. The forces of bureaucratic inertia and the simple reality that this is a minor detail on a single webpage still make the status quo ('Yes') the overwhelmingly likely outcome. Therefore, I am making a small adjustment from 95% down to 92% to reflect the slightly higher-than-previously-estimated risk of a symbolic, text-only change.",
