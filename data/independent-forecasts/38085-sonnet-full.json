  "information": "According to data from Drought.gov on May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents, representing 73.9% of the state's population, were in drought-affected areas. Reports from late April 2025 indicated that 84% of the state was classified under moderate to extreme drought conditions, a severity level not seen since April 2012. The state has recorded its 12th driest April-to-March period since 1895, and some regions are 6-10 inches below their average rainfall since mid-October 2024.\n\nThe drought has caused significant ecological and public safety consequences. The Everglades is experiencing its worst drought in 13 years, causing some areas to dry up completely, which has led to the suspension of tourism activities like airboat tours. As of early May 2025, elevated fire risk resulted in over 100 active wildfires burning more than 3,600 acres of vegetation. In response to the dry conditions, at least 21 counties have issued burn bans.\n\nThe forecast period coincides with the start of Florida's typical rainy season on June 1, which is also the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a 60% chance of an above-average 2025 hurricane season, with 13-19 named tropical storms expected. This is attributed to factors like warmer ocean temperatures and low wind shear. However, a separate NOAA forecast from March 2025 also predicted that drought conditions in South Florida would likely persist from April through June.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 30 days (from May 29, 2025 to June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Currently 14.5 million Florida residents are living in drought conditions, which is above the 14.0 million threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Florida receives substantial rainfall in early June from the beginning of the rainy season or from tropical weather systems. Multiple significant precipitation events over the next 30 days lead to rapid improvement in drought classifications, causing the drought-affected population to drop below 14.0 million by June 28",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Drought conditions persist through June despite the start of the rainy season on June 1. Rainfall is normal or below-normal for late May and June, consistent with NOAA's March 2025 forecast predicting South Florida drought would continue through June. The severe drought conditions that have built up since October 2024 do not improve sufficiently in just 30 days to reduce the affected population below 14.0 million",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. As of May 29, 2025, Florida already has 14.5 million residents in drought-affected areas, which is 500,000 above the threshold. Good forecasters place substantial weight on status quo outcomes because conditions typically change slowly. Several factors support continued drought conditions: (1) The drought has been building since mid-October 2024, representing the 12th driest April-to-March period since 1895; (2) NOAA specifically forecast in March 2025 that South Florida drought would persist through June; (3) Droughts rarely resolve within 30 days without exceptional rainfall; (4) While the rainy season begins June 1, it takes time for precipitation to replenish soil moisture and improve drought classifications. The primary risk to this forecast comes from the rainy season's typical increase in precipitation and the forecast for an above-average hurricane season, which could bring heavy rainfall events. However, 30 days is a relatively short timeframe for drought recovery, especially given the severity of current conditions (worst Everglades drought in 13 years). The buffer of 500,000 residents above the threshold is modest but meaningful. I would update my forecast higher if early June proves exceptionally dry or if drought conditions worsen. I would update lower if significant tropical weather systems bring heavy rainfall to drought-affected areas in early June, or if rapid improvement in drought classifications is observed",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to data from Drought.gov on May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents, representing 73.9% of the state's population, were in drought-affected areas.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
