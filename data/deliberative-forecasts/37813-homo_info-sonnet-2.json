    "review": "Both forecasters independently arrived at 60%, which is notable convergence. Their key arguments that I should weight more heavily: (1) The explicit characterization of December's 6 sightings as 'rare' in NUFORC's history suggests the baseline monthly rate is likely quite low, possibly with many months having zero cube-shaped reports. (2) Forecaster 2's invocation of regression to the mean is apt - December may be a significant outlier rather than representative. (3) Forecaster 3's explicit reasoning that if 6 is rare, the baseline might be 0-2 per month with many zeroes, provides a clearer statistical framework. I was perhaps too optimistic in weighting the December example, treating it as more representative than it likely is. The independent convergence at 60% suggests my 68% may overweight the availability of the December data point and underweight how 'rare' truly means in this context. However, I still believe: (1) The very low threshold of only 1 sighting (vs 6) provides meaningful upward pressure that both forecasters acknowledge but may slightly underweight. (2) June being a summer month with increased outdoor activity and better observation conditions is a real factor. (3) The temporal proximity of the December 2024 example (just 6 months prior) suggests cube sightings are at least on NUFORC's radar currently.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the independent convergence of two forecasters at 60% is a strong signal that my initial 68% was somewhat optimistic. The characterization of December's 6 cube sightings as 'rare' in NUFORC's history is a key constraint I should weight more heavily. If 6 is rare, the typical month likely has 0-2 such sightings, with many months having zero. However, I maintain that the threshold requiring only 1 sighting (not multiple) provides meaningful probability mass, and summer conditions in June should slightly favor increased UFO reporting generally. Balancing these factors with the consensus view that I was slightly overconfident, I'm updating downward but not all the way to 60%. My updated forecast of 62% reflects: (1) greater respect for what 'rare' implies about baseline rates, (2) acknowledgment that December may be more of an outlier than I initially weighted, (3) but retention of some premium for the low threshold and favorable June timing.",
