    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Rippling is a private company and has not announced plans for an IPO. The most likely outcome in a short timeframe is the continuation of this status.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The July 1, 2025, deadline passes without Rippling filing an S-1 or posting an IPO announcement on its official news blog. The company continues to operate as a private entity, perhaps satisfied with its current funding and waiting for a more opportune market window in the future.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by a sudden improvement in market conditions for tech IPOs or internal strategic goals, Rippling's management accelerates its timeline and makes a formal announcement before July 1, 2025, either by filing a public S-1 with the SEC or by publishing the news on its official company website.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the very short timeframe for the resolution of this question. As of today, May 22, 2025, there are only about five weeks remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline. The process of preparing for and announcing an IPO is a significant corporate undertaking that is typically preceded by months of confidential preparation and, often, weeks of public speculation and media reports. There is currently a lack of such public signaling. The status quo is that Rippling is a well-funded private company, and over a short period, the status quo is the most probable outcome. While the provided background indicates the company is growing and its shares are gaining value in private markets, this does not necessitate an immediate IPO; strong private performance can reduce the urgency to go public. My probability is not lower than 2% because a surprise announcement is always possible. A company can prepare for an IPO confidentially and move quickly if it perceives a strategic opening. However, my probability is not higher because of the complete absence of any public evidence—such as reports from major financial news outlets or hints from company leadership—suggesting an announcement is imminent. I would increase my forecast if credible reports emerge that Rippling has confidentially filed or is targeting a June announcement. I would decrease it as the deadline approaches with no news.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Rippling announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Startup News: Shares of HR firm Rippling gain value as its business expands](https://forgeglobal.com/insights/blog/startup-news-shares-of-rippling-gain-value-as-its-business-expands/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Rippling, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.rippling.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
