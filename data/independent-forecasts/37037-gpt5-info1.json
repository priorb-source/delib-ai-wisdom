  "information": "In early April 2025, the U.S. administration announced a new trade policy based on 'reciprocal tariffs,' effectively ending the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) which had allowed many African countries to export goods to the U.S. duty-free. The new policy applies tariffs to approximately 185 countries. The tariff rates are determined by a formula that involves dividing a country's bilateral trade deficit with the U.S. by the amount of U.S. imports from that country, and then dividing the result by two. This policy resulted in varying tariff rates, including 50% for Lesotho and Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, 49% for Cambodia, 46% for Vietnam, 34% for China, and 20% for the European Union. The new tariffs took effect on April 9, 2025, although the U.S. later announced a 90-day pause on introducing new tariffs for some countries, a move not extended to Lesotho.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 39 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the reciprocal tariff policy implemented April 9 sets Lesotho’s rate at 50%, and HTS typically reflects such measures; absent changes, it should still list 50% on June 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration revises or pauses the policy for Lesotho (e.g., adds it to the 90‑day pause, carves out LDCs, changes the formula or cap), Congress or a court action leads USITC to remove the 50% listing from HTS before June 1, or data corrections reduce Lesotho’s computed rate below 50%.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The April 9 reciprocal tariff remains in force as written, and the USITC HTS continues to list an additional 50% duty on goods of Lesotho (even if marked as suspended), so the HTS page queried for “Lesotho” shows a 50% duty on or after June 1.",
    "rationale": "What’s being forecast: Whether HTS will list a 50% tariff for Lesotho on or after June 1, 2025. Resolution depends on what HTS displays, not on whether the tariff is active; a “suspended” label would still count if the duty shown is 50%.\n\nKey evidence (from RA): In early April 2025, the administration launched a “reciprocal tariffs” regime replacing AGOA preferences and applying country‑specific rates via a formula. Reported resulting rates include 50% for Lesotho. The tariffs took effect April 9, and a 90‑day pause on some countries was not extended to Lesotho.\n\nBase rate/status quo: Given the announced policy and effective date, the status quo is that HTS includes a 50% additional duty for Lesotho (likely via Ch. 99 provisions). With only ~5½ weeks until June 1 and agencies’ tendency to leave posted tariff notes in place for a while, the default is that the listing remains.\n\nRisks lowering the probability:\n- Policy adjustment before June 1: The administration could add Lesotho to the pause, carve out least‑developed countries, revise the formula or cap, or otherwise reduce Lesotho’s rate below 50% in response to criticism (as flagged by AP coverage).\n- Legal or congressional action: A court injunction or legislative fix might prompt USITC to remove (not just suspend) the 50% listing before June 1. While a “suspension” label wouldn’t change resolution, outright removal would.\n- Data corrections: If the formula is recalculated with updated trade figures, Lesotho’s computed rate could shift below 50%.\n\nWhy not higher: These nontrivial pathways (policy tweaks, legal developments, or data revisions) could change the displayed rate or remove the listing within the short window. The administration has already shown willingness to pause for some countries, indicating potential flexibility.\n\nWhy not lower: The policy is already announced and in effect; Lesotho was explicitly not included in the pause; and the time horizon is short. Bureaucratic inertia and the explicit note that “suspended” still counts both support a higher base.\n\nWhat would move me up: Direct confirmation on HTS now showing a 50% Lesotho listing; USTR/USITC guidance affirming no near‑term changes; evidence that any litigation would result in a suspension notice rather than removal from HTS.\n\nWhat would move me down: Credible reports of a policy revision, LDC carve‑out, or pause including Lesotho; an updated proclamation revising Lesotho’s rate; or HTS updates showing a different rate or the removal of Lesotho’s 50% listing before June 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Lesotho as 50% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [How tiny Lesotho ended up with the highest US tariffs in the world](https://apnews.com/article/lesotho-us-trump-tariffs-b337efa47290e889aa076cc9ede7bc9d)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
