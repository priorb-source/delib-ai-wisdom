    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling points I underweighted in my initial analysis. Most notably, Forecaster 3 correctly observes that the Beaumont Enterprise article title 'poses a question rather than reporting passage,' which suggests genuine uncertainty rather than imminent legislative action. Both forecasters emphasize the base rate for controversial legislation - that most proposed bills fail, especially late in session - which I acknowledged but didn't sufficiently weight. Forecaster 2's point about the typical multi-month timeline for comprehensive legislation is well-taken, and both note stakeholder opposition (hemp industry, medical marijuana advocates, libertarian legislators) that would likely slow any ban. The complete absence of concrete information about bill progress - no mention of committee passage, floor votes, or specific bill numbers - is more significant than I initially credited. If legislation were truly advanced, we would expect more definitive reporting than a speculative article headline.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 18% forecast was too optimistic given the evidence. The key factors pushing me downward are: (1) The article headline frames this as an open question, not imminent action, (2) Zero concrete information about any bill's actual legislative progress, (3) The extremely compressed 6.5-week timeline in the final weeks of session, (4) Base rates showing most controversial late-session bills fail, and (5) Expected opposition from multiple stakeholder groups that would slow passage. However, I don't move all the way to 8% because there is documented legislative interest, we are currently in session (not between sessions), and Texas does have a conservative drug policy history. The 10-12% range better reflects appropriate status quo bias while acknowledging some non-zero possibility. I'm updating to 12%, aligning with Forecaster 3's reasoning, which appropriately balances the small possibility against the strong status quo presumption.",
