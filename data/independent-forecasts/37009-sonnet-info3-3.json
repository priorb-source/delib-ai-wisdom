  "information": "Several prominent Democrats, including Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, have opted not to run for the Senate seat. Meanwhile, other Democratic candidates such as Mallory McMorrow and Abdul El-Sayed have already officially entered the race. As of late April 2025, Stevens had not filed any paperwork with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to form an exploratory committee.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "10 days until May 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Haley Stevens has not announced her candidacy",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Stevens continues to not file any FEC paperwork or make any announcement in the remaining 10 days before the May 1 deadline, consistent with her current trajectory of not entering the race",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Stevens makes a late-stage decision to enter the race and announces her candidacy within the next 10 days, possibly responding to pressure from party leaders to provide a strong Democratic candidate after other prominent figures declined to run",
    "rationale": "With only 10 days remaining until the deadline and strong evidence suggesting Stevens is not preparing to run, the status quo strongly points toward a No resolution. The research assistant reports that as of late April 2025, Stevens has not filed any FEC paperwork to form an exploratory committee. This is a critical indicator, as candidates typically file such paperwork before announcing their candidacy. The political context also suggests limited likelihood of entry: several prominent Democrats including Governor Whitmer and Secretary Buttigieg have already declined to run, and other candidates like Mallory McMorrow and Abdul El-Sayed are already officially in the race. This suggests the Democratic field is taking shape without Stevens. While 10 days is technically sufficient time for an announcement, the complete absence of preparatory steps makes a late entry highly unlikely. My forecast is not lower because there remains technical possibility - politicians can make rapid decisions, and unexpected circumstances could arise. It's not higher because the lack of any visible preparation combined with the very short timeframe makes an announcement extremely improbable. I would update higher only if there were reports of Stevens meeting with party leaders or filing FEC paperwork; I would update lower as we approach May 1 with continued silence.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Haley Stevens announces her candidacy for US Senator from Michigan before May 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
