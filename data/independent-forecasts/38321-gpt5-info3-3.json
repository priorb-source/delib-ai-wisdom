  "information": "The NATO summit is scheduled to take place from June 24 to June 26, 2025, at the World Forum in The Hague, Netherlands. This will be the first time the Netherlands has hosted a NATO summit. Over 6,000 delegates and 2,000 journalists from 32 NATO member countries and partner nations are expected to be in attendance. President Trump's schedule for June 2025 also includes other high-profile international travel, such as his attendance at the G7 leaders' summit in Kananaskis, Canada, from June 15 to 17.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 20–22 days (the summit runs June 24–26, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — US presidents almost always attend NATO summits, and Trump attended NATO leaders’ meetings in his prior term.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump pointedly skips to pressure allies on defense spending or to avoid The Hague optics (ICC is based there), sending the VP/Secretary of State instead; or a late-breaking domestic/emergency/health/security issue prevents travel.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "He travels to The Hague, participates in leaders’ sessions and photo-ops, and uses the platform to push allies on burden-sharing and claim progress, fitting cleanly between the G7 in Canada (June 15–17) and the NATO summit (June 24–26).",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/status quo: The summit is June 24–26 in The Hague. US presidents have a near-unbroken record of attending NATO summits; Trump himself attended NATO leaders’ meetings in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Skipping would be a major diplomatic signal and highly newsworthy. With only ~3 weeks to go, the default is attendance. The RA also notes Trump is slated for the G7 in Canada June 15–17, which makes consecutive high-level travel in late June plausible.\n- Incentives to attend: High-profile venue to pressure allies on 2% spending, claim credit for increased outlays, and shape alliance messaging. Many allies have raised defense spending, which Trump can highlight as validation of his pressure tactics.\n- Risks/paths to No: Trump’s unpredictability and skepticism of NATO raise some chance of a deliberate snub. The Hague’s association with the ICC could create unwanted optics. Non-trivial tail risks include sudden domestic crises, health, or security concerns leading to last-minute changes.\n- Why not higher: Trump has previously skipped or curtailed parts of multilateral gatherings and could choose to send a surrogate to maintain leverage; he may perceive political upside in a snub. The ICC/Hague optics slightly increase the likelihood of avoidance.\n- Why not lower: The base rate of US presidential attendance at NATO summits is extremely high, and the costs—diplomatic and political—of an outright no-show are substantial. The timing is convenient (after G7), and there’s little structural barrier to attendance.\n- What would move me up: Official White House confirmation and published bilaterals in The Hague; advance team sightings; NATO listing him on confirmed leaders’ attendance; pooled press logistics released; aircraft movement indications close to departure.\n- What would move me down: Credible reporting that the VP/Secretary will lead the US delegation; statements framing a boycott/conditional attendance; emergent domestic crisis or security threat; health-related news.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a NATO summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the NATO Summit such that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe NATO summit is scheduled to take place from June 24 to June 26, 2025, at the World Forum in The Hague, Netherlands.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
