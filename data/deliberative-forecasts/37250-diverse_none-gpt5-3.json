    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short two-month window and the heavy legal/administrative inertia post-deportation. I find Forecaster 2’s addition of the credible-reporting requirement for an unauthorized reentry particularly salient—many irregular entries wouldn’t be publicly documented to the standard needed for resolution, further lowering that pathway’s weight. The mention of required waivers (I-212/I-601) and immigrant visa processing aligns with my priors on timeframes, though I’d flag that we don’t independently verify his specific inadmissibility grounds here. Forecaster 3’s reasoning mirrors my original base-rate view but doesn’t adjust for how unlikely it is that a clandestine return would be credibly reported in time. Net, the added emphasis on the reporting hurdle and multi-step waiver timelines nudges me downward.",
    "rationale": "About 61 days remain. Status quo is No. Yes paths: (1) DHS humanitarian parole or comparable discretionary action, (2) court-ordered facilitation, (3) irregular entry paired with credible public reporting (e.g., arrest with named reporting or deliberate publicity). Given no signals of ongoing litigation, agency engagement, or advocacy momentum, (1) and (2) look very unlikely on this time horizon. Path (3) is possible but further constrained by the resolution’s need for credible sources naming him, which many border enforcement reports wouldn’t provide. These considerations make my prior 8% high; I’m updating down to reflect the reporting constraint and the multi-month/years nature of any legal readmission plus waivers. I’d move up on credible reporting of DHS/court action or concrete travel/POE plans; I’d move further down with time decay or explicit denials by DHS/consulate or signs of no active efforts.",
