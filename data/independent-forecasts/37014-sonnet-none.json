    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. The 2025 Kent County Council election is scheduled for the first Thursday in May 2025, which would be May 1, 2025, given today's date of April 22, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Conservatives retain the most seats. Kent County Council has been under Conservative control continuously since 1997, and they currently hold a significant majority of the 81 seats. The status quo would be a continuation of Conservative dominance in this traditionally Conservative-leaning county.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives maintain their plurality despite Reform UK gains, or Labour/Liberal Democrats outperform Reform UK. Traditional parties benefit from established local organizations, known candidates, and voters' tendency to support familiar names in local elections. Reform UK's poll numbers don't translate into actual votes, particularly as local elections often have different dynamics than national polling suggests.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Reform UK successfully converts national polling momentum into local election victories across Kent's 81 divisions. The Electoral Calculus poll prediction proves accurate, with Reform UK benefiting from protest votes against the Conservatives, strong name recognition from Nigel Farage, and successful candidate recruitment across the county. Local concerns about immigration, housing, and dissatisfaction with mainstream parties drive voters to Reform UK.",
    "rationale": "The Electoral Calculus poll mentioned in the background is significant evidence suggesting Reform UK could win. However, several factors make me cautious about assigning a high probability: (1) Reform UK has no track record of winning control of any county council and limited experience in local government; (2) Local elections require strong ground organization and candidate quality, which new parties typically lack; (3) Polls for local elections are notoriously unreliable compared to general election polls; (4) Converting national protest vote sentiment into local election success is difficult - voters often split their tickets; (5) The Conservatives have deep organizational roots in Kent and known local candidates. That said, we're very close to the election (about 1-2 weeks), so major changes are unlikely, and the existence of a specific poll prediction is meaningful. My forecast is not higher because Reform UK faces structural disadvantages in local elections and historically insurgent parties underperform polls. It's not lower because the poll evidence is real and we're close enough to the election that it can't be easily dismissed. I would update higher if: additional polls confirmed the trend, evidence of strong Reform UK local organization emerged, or betting markets strongly favored Reform UK. I would update lower if: new polling showed Conservative recovery, evidence of weak Reform UK candidate quality emerged, or historical analysis showed Electoral Calculus polls for local elections were systematically biased.",
