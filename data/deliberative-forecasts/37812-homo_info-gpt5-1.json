    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a useful macro datapoint (Q1 2025 passengers down only ~1.4% YoY) that I hadn’t considered; it supports a stable base and argues against an extremely depressed network. However, their argument relies more on typical summer seasonality than on a current, detailed route count, and doesn’t reconcile with which specific carriers/routes are still absent. Forecaster 3 provides the most concrete new information: an OAG-based figure of ~39 active destinations in May 2025 and a list of key absences (BA, Lufthansa Group, Saudia, EgyptAir, Pegasus; plus Kuwait Airways and Qatar Airways). If accurate, that substantially lowers the baseline versus my prior assumption in the high 40s. I’m somewhat skeptical that both Qatar and Pegasus are absent (and MEA may still cover some European points), but the directional point remains: the current base is likely lower than I assumed. Given the short runway to July 1, adding 13+ destinations requires a strong seasonal wave; RA’s confirmed adds (SAS CPH/ARN, Transavia ORY, AF CDG, Wizz AUH, MEA BCN, LOT WAW) likely contribute ~6–7 airports, so we’d still need several more seasonal/secondary routes to clear >51. On balance, F3’s specific count is a persuasive downward nudge; F2’s seasonality/pax stability is an upward counterweight but less concrete for this threshold test.",
    "rationale": "I initially assessed the network as already in the high 40s with momentum to tip just over 51. Forecaster 3’s OAG-based ~39 active destinations in May implies my baseline was too high. Even granting some uncertainty about whether Qatar/PEG/EgyptAir are indeed absent and acknowledging FlightsFrom counts airports (so ORY and CDG, IST and SAW, etc., each contribute separately), reaching >51 by July 1 would still require a further wave of seasonal adds beyond the already announced resumptions. The RA-confirmed additions (SAS CPH/ARN, AF/Transavia CDG/ORY, Wizz AUH, MEA BCN, LOT WAW) plausibly add ~6–7 airports to May’s base, taking us to mid-40s. Additional likely summer adds (some Turkish resorts, Greek islands, possibly a few Saudi secondary resumptions or regional leisure points) could add several more, but security/tourism headwinds make a double‑digit surge less likely, and late-June pullbacks remain a risk. Forecaster 2’s passenger stability argues the floor isn’t collapsing, keeping upside viable, but it doesn’t by itself guarantee the breadth needed to pass the >51 threshold on the FlightsFrom snapshot. Net: I update down moderately from 46% to 40%, reflecting a lower starting point and tighter time window, while keeping substantial upside if seasonal routes and a few key Gulf/European resumptions materialize and persist through July 1.",
