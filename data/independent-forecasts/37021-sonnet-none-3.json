    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-3 weeks. April 2025 inflation data is typically published by Trading Economics in early-to-mid May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo would be that Ukraine's inflation remains at its recent trajectory. Without specific current data, but given the April 10 article warning about stagflation risks, the status quo suggests elevated inflation that may or may not cross the 15% threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine's April 2025 inflation rate remains below 15.0%. This would occur if recent monetary policy measures have been effective in containing price pressures, international financial support has stabilized the economy, or if supply chain conditions have improved more than the stagflation warning suggests. The inflation rate might be in the 10-14% range - elevated but not reaching the threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ukraine's April 2025 inflation rate reaches or exceeds 15.0%. This would materialize if the stagflation warning in the April 10 article reflects an actual deterioration in inflation metrics, potentially driven by currency depreciation, energy price increases, continued war-related supply disruptions, or accelerating food prices. The economic pressures already evident in early April would manifest in the full month's data.",
    "rationale": "The key challenge is that we're on April 22, 2025, meaning April's inflation data is essentially determined but not yet published. The research assistant provided no specific recent inflation figures, making this primarily a reasoning exercise. The April 10 article warning about Ukraine being 'one step away from stagflation' is the main signal. Stagflation implies both economic stagnation and high inflation occurring simultaneously. This warning suggests inflation is elevated and concerning to observers, but doesn't confirm a specific level. Ukraine's wartime economy faces persistent inflationary pressures from currency instability, disrupted supply chains, and energy market volatility. However, international aid and central bank interventions have helped moderate inflation from its 2022 peaks. The 15% threshold is relatively high - it represents concerning but not hyperinflationary levels. Without recent data points showing inflation at 13-14% or higher, I cannot assign high confidence to crossing this threshold. The stagflation warning increases probability above 50%, but absent confirmation that current rates are already near 15%, significant uncertainty remains. My forecast is not higher because: (1) lack of specific recent data showing inflation approaching 15%, (2) status quo bias suggests if inflation was lower in recent months, sudden jumps are less likely, and (3) international support mechanisms may be containing pressures. My forecast is not lower because: (1) the stagflation warning article suggests genuine concern about elevated inflation, (2) Ukraine's wartime pressures create persistent upward price pressures, and (3) the timing of the warning (early April) suggests problems may already be manifesting. To update higher, I would need: evidence that March 2025 inflation was already 13-14% or reports of sharp price increases in April. To update lower, I would need: recent data showing inflation in single digits or strong disinflation trends.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine's inflation rate increase to at least 15.0% for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Ukraine is one step away from stagflation. And here's why](https://en.iz.ru/en/1868046/2025-04-10/ukraine-one-step-away-stagflation-and-heres-why)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Ukraine's annualized inflation rate is greater than or equal to 15.0% for the month of April 2025, according to the number presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/ukraine/inflation-cpi). Under 15.0% resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
