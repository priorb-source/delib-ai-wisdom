    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my initial reasoning: short time horizon, entrenched authoritarian consolidation, weak external leverage post-ECOWAS, and low likelihood of quick legal or political U-turns. New useful nuances they added include: (1) the analogies to Burkina Faso and Niger’s sustained suspensions without quick reversal; (2) MINUSMA’s departure and Russia-linked support further reducing Western/UN leverage; and (3) a possible (but currently unobserved) WAEMU lever. None of this provides evidence of imminent reversal; it slightly strengthens the case for a marginally lower probability. I didn’t see concrete new signals pointing upward.",
    "rationale": "With ~5.5 weeks left, a public reversal would be a conspicuous climbdown from a high-salience decree integral to the junta’s control strategy. External pressure is limited (ECOWAS exit trajectory, muted Western leverage, Russia linkage), and domestic institutions are regime-aligned, making court-driven reversal improbable. There is no clear, near-term electoral calendar requiring parties, and no reported mass mobilization or elite split likely to force a rapid concession. Tails remain: an unexpected shock—major protests/strikes, budget/aid pressure biting via WAEMU or key donors, or intra-junta rupture—could prompt a tactical, face-saving repeal. But absent signals of such triggers, the base rate for a quick reversal is very low. Incorporating the cross-case analogies in the Sahel and the short fuse, I trim slightly from 8% to 7%.",
