  "information": "According to reports, Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks for nine to ten consecutive quarters through Q4 2024, with cash reserves reaching between $334 billion and $347.7 billion by the end of that year. The company's portfolio turnover rate is 0.97%. Warren Buffett recently stated that the 'Magnificent Seven' companies require more capital to operate today than they did a few years ago, reiterating that Berkshire Hathaway's investment philosophy is to seek companies with high returns and low capital needs.\n\nThe 'Magnificent Seven' stocks led a market rebound starting April 8, 2025, but their performance in the first four months of 2025 was negative. The group's value stumbled due to investor concerns over the economic impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs, announced on April 2, which caused a combined loss of $2.27 trillion in market value before recovering by May 2. Specific stocks were affected differently; year-to-date, Tesla's stock had declined 31% and Amazon's 15%. Around May 5, 2025, the US stock market saw the end of a 9-day winning streak.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings reports for the 'Magnificent Seven' showed varied performance. Meta's earnings per share beat analyst estimates, and Microsoft's revenue and profit exceeded expectations. In contrast, Amazon's cloud business showed decelerating growth, while Apple reported a 4.8% increase in earnings on 5.1% higher revenues. Both Amazon and Apple cited tariffs as a potential headwind. Around the same period, Warren Buffett announced his plan to retire as CEO at the end of 2025, with Greg Abel set to take over. On March 17, 2025, Berkshire Hathaway Class B shares reached a record high of $523.01.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 days (13F due by May 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire continues its recent pattern of being a net seller with minimal turnover and does not initiate any new positions in Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, or Tesla in Q1 2025. Alternatively, if it did begin building a position, it seeks and obtains confidential treatment so the Q1 13F does not show the holding.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A small position initiated by Todd Combs or Ted Weschler in Alphabet, Meta, or Microsoft appears in the Q1 2025 13F. (Purchases of Nvidia or Tesla are much less likely given prior comments.) Even a modest stake would trigger a Yes under the resolution criteria.",
    "rationale": "Base rate and recent behavior point to No. Berkshire has not held any Magnificent 7 name beyond Apple and Amazon in recent years, despite myriad opportunities. The research assistant notes Berkshire was a net seller for 9–10 consecutive quarters into Q4 2024, with an extremely low portfolio turnover (~0.97%) and record cash balances. Buffett has also remarked that many Mag 7 businesses now require more capital, which runs counter to Berkshire’s preference for high returns on low incremental capital. Q1 2025 ended before the early-April tariff shock; Mag 7 valuations were still elevated through quarter-end, making new positions less likely if valuation discipline is binding. \nCountervailing considerations do exist. Todd/Ted have latitude to initiate modest positions (as happened with Amazon) without using confidential treatment, and a small stake in Alphabet, Meta, or Microsoft would qualify for a Yes. Concentration in Apple may create some incentive to diversify within mega-cap tech. However, if Berkshire were building a sizable stake in any of these, it might request confidential treatment, which would cause the Q1 13F to omit the position and thus resolve No for this question. \nWhy not higher: 1) Longstanding avoidance of these names (except Apple/Amazon), 2) continued net-seller posture and very low turnover, 3) high Q1 valuations, and 4) possibility of confidential treatment masking any ongoing accumulation. \nWhy not lower: Todd/Ted could still initiate a small, disclosed position; Apple concentration risk may push diversification; and Alphabet/Meta/Microsoft have moaty profiles that Berkshire admires, even if rarely acted upon. \nWhat would move me up: Credible pre-13F reporting that Berkshire/Todd/Ted initiated a new mega-cap tech position; AGM or media hints that “you’ll see something new in the 13F”; evidence that Apple trims were funded into another tech moat. \nWhat would move me down: Clear statements that Berkshire was again a net seller with no significant new positions in Q1; any indication of a fresh confidential treatment request (implying omissions in the 13F); or reliable reporting that portfolio activity was minimal in Q1.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
