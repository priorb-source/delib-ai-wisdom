  "information": "US trade policy has been a factor influencing the dollar's value. In February 2025, the US administration implemented a 10% tariff on certain Chinese goods, and the possibility of tariffs on European Union products remains. The US President has mentioned potential 25% tariffs on EU imports, including automobiles. In a separate policy development, the German government announced a 500 billion euro off-budget defense infrastructure fund, which led to a 1.60% appreciation of the euro on the day of the announcement. In January 2025, Bank of America released a forecast projecting a stronger US dollar by the end of 2025, with a central forecast for the EUR/USD rate at 1.05.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The resolution period begins in 6 days (May 12, 2025) and ends on July 1, 2025, giving a total window of approximately 50 days for the outcome to be determined.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the dollar would remain above 0.80 EUR",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The dollar stabilizes or strengthens due to positive US economic data, Federal Reserve policy stance, or de-escalation of trade tensions. Bank of America's forecast of EUR/USD at 1.05 (equivalent to USD at ~0.95 EUR) materializes, keeping the dollar well above the 0.80 EUR threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Significant escalation of US-EU trade tensions with implementation of the threatened 25% tariffs on EU imports including automobiles, combined with continued strong EU fiscal expansion (following Germany's 500 billion euro defense fund), causes rapid dollar depreciation. Additional negative US economic data or unexpected dovish Fed pivot accelerates the move, pushing USD below 0.80 EUR.",
    "rationale": "The current situation shows the dollar at a 3-year low amid tariff turmoil, indicating significant recent weakness. However, reaching 0.80 EUR per USD (equivalent to EUR/USD at 1.25) would require an additional ~18-20% depreciation from the approximate current level of 0.95-0.97 EUR per USD (based on Bank of America's 1.05 EUR/USD forecast baseline). This is a substantial move to occur in less than two months.\n\nKey factors supporting a lower probability: (1) Bank of America's professional forecast anticipates EUR/USD at 1.05 by year-end, suggesting stability rather than sharp dollar weakness; (2) The dollar is already at multi-year lows, potentially limiting downside; (3) Historical currency movements of 15-20% in 50 days are rare absent major crises; (4) Mean reversion pressures typically exist after significant moves.\n\nKey factors preventing an even lower probability: (1) The German defense fund announcement caused a 1.60% single-day euro appreciation, demonstrating real volatility potential; (2) The threat of 25% EU tariffs remains unresolved and could materialize; (3) Trade policy uncertainty is genuinely elevated; (4) The short timeframe means a concentrated shock could achieve this threshold even if unsustainable.\n\nFor me to update higher (toward 35-40%), I would need: concrete implementation of broad EU tariffs, clear signs of US economic deterioration, or explicit dovish Fed signals. To update lower (toward 5-10%), I would need: tariff de-escalation, strong US data, or euro-negative EU policy developments.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
