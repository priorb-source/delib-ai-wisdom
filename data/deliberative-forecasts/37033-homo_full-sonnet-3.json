    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that I had underweighted. Most critically, they emphasize that this was Zimbabwe's FIRST payment after years of delays under the 2020 agreement - a point that has significant base rate implications for the pace of future payments. Forecaster 2's observation that the first payment represented only 1% of the first batch suggests a deliberately slow disbursement strategy. Forecaster 3's point about typical government behavior - spacing payments for cash flow and political management rather than making rapid successive payments - is empirically sound. The agreement structure (1% cash, 99% bonds) further suggests cash payments may be rare events rather than frequent occurrences. Both correctly frame the status quo as 'No' - absent specific new action, another payment within 38 days is not the default expectation, especially just 2 weeks after the first historic payment.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 48% to 40%. The other forecasters convinced me that I was too optimistic about payment momentum and insufficiently weighted the significance of this being the FIRST payment after years of delay. The pattern of taking years to make an initial payment, then making only 1% of planned payments, strongly suggests a cautious, slow-paced approach rather than rapid successive disbursements. However, I'm not going quite as low as 32-35% because: (1) The funds are already allocated in the 2025 budget - this is qualitatively different from previous years of non-payment; (2) 38 days provides adequate time for bureaucratic processing if political will exists; (3) The strategic importance for debt restructuring and sanctions relief creates urgent motivation; (4) The low absolute dollar amount ($6.9M remaining) means another small payment is financially feasible. The government has now demonstrated both capability and intent. While typical government behavior suggests spacing payments, the unprecedented international pressure and specific debt relief negotiations create atypical incentives for more rapid action. My 40% forecast reflects that the status quo favors No, but meaningful probability exists for another payment given allocated funds, proven capability, and strategic importance.",
