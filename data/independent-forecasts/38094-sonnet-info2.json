  "information": "Concerns have been raised regarding Senator Fetterman's performance and health. As of late May 2025, he had missed approximately 30 floor votes, giving him one of the lowest attendance records in the Senate. A report from Yahoo cited a 1,600-word email from Fetterman's former chief of staff, Adam Jentleson, sent to the senator's doctor in May 2024. The email detailed 'warning signs' such as reckless driving and conspiratorial thinking. Other Democratic senators have also privately expressed worries about his ability to handle the stresses of the office.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "33 days (from May 29, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Fetterman continues caucusing with the Democratic Party",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Senator Fetterman continues serving as a Democratic senator through July 1, 2025, maintaining his caucus affiliation despite concerns about his attendance and performance. He may miss additional votes but remains a member of the Democratic caucus.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Fetterman either experiences a sudden health crisis requiring immediate resignation, switches parties in a dramatic political realignment, or faces an unexpected circumstance forcing him to cease caucusing with Democrats within the next 33 days.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome for several key reasons. First, Fetterman has explicitly stated he will not resign, as reported in the PennLive article. Second, the timeframe is extremely short - only 33 days remain until the resolution date. Third, party switching by sitting senators is exceptionally rare in modern politics, typically occurring fewer than once per decade and usually telegraphed well in advance. The research assistant's report does highlight legitimate concerns: low attendance (approximately 30 missed floor votes), a 2024 email from his former chief of staff detailing warning signs, and private worries from fellow Democrats about his performance. However, these concerns have been ongoing without triggering resignation or party switching. The base rate for mid-term Senate resignations is very low, and even senators facing health challenges typically complete their terms. What would need to be true for higher probability: concrete evidence of imminent resignation plans, public statements about leaving the party, or a major acute health crisis. What keeps probability from being even lower: the documented concerns about his capacity and the non-zero possibility of an unexpected medical emergency in the next month. The combination of his explicit commitment to stay, the short timeframe, institutional inertia, and the extremely low base rates for both resignation and party switching all point to a very low probability of this outcome occurring.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Senator John Fetterman cease caucusing with the Democrats before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Fetterman says he won’t resign, gets support from McCormick as article blowback continues](https://www.pennlive.com/news/2025/05/fetterman-says-he-wont-resign-gets-support-from-mccormick-as-article-blowback-continues.html) | [An isolated, angry Fetterman is yet another challenge for Democrats](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/16/john-fetterman-senate-relationships/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
