    "review": "All three forecasters converge remarkably closely at 18-20%, suggesting strong consensus about this being a low but non-negligible probability event. Forecaster 2 provides valuable new information about May's historical weakness for EUR/USD (averaging -0.62%), which actually works against the needed euro appreciation. Forecaster 3 introduces Bank of America's professional forecast of EUR/USD at only 1.05 by year-end - significantly below the 1.25 threshold needed, suggesting even professional analysts don't expect this level in 2025. However, I note Forecaster 3 appears confused about current levels (citing 0.95-0.97 USD/EUR when it's actually 0.884). The German defense fund example showing 1.60% single-day moves is useful for calibrating volatility potential. Both forecasters correctly emphasize the magnitude challenge: approximately 10-11% euro appreciation needed in under 2 months, which is 3-4x normal monthly volatility for major currency pairs.",
    "rationale": "The new information moderately supports maintaining or slightly lowering my forecast. The Bank of America year-end forecast at 1.05 EUR/USD is particularly informative - professional analysts aren't expecting the 1.25 level even by December, making July 1 even less likely. The May seasonal weakness pattern also works against the required move. However, these factors are partially offset by: (1) the unresolved 25% EU tariff threat that could materialize, (2) demonstrated volatility potential from recent events, and (3) the dollar already being at 3-year lows suggesting momentum exists. The convergence around 18-20% across all forecasters increases my confidence this range appropriately captures both the low base rate of such rapid major currency moves and the genuine tail risk from trade policy uncertainty. I'm maintaining 18% as it balances the professional forecasts suggesting limited upside with the real possibility of a concentrated shock in an unusually volatile environment.",
