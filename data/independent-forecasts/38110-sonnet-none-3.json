    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 1 day - the question resolves on July 1, 2025, and today is May 31, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the borders remain closed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security concerns regarding the Mahmuda terror group, arms smuggling, and trade disputes remain unresolved, and Benin maintains its border closure through June 30, 2025. Diplomatic negotiations, if occurring, have not progressed sufficiently to result in reopening within the next 24 hours.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Emergency diplomatic talks between Benin and Nigeria succeed overnight, resulting in a surprise announcement of border reopening on June 30, 2025. This could occur if high-level political intervention addresses the security concerns urgently, or if pre-existing negotiations we're unaware of reach sudden completion.",
    "rationale": "With only one day remaining until the resolution date, the status quo strongly favors a No outcome. The borders were closed in May 2025 for multiple serious security reasons: attacks by the terror group Mahmuda, arms smuggling, and trade-related disputes over soya bean exportation. These are substantive issues that typically require extensive diplomatic negotiations, security assessments, and coordinated policy changes between two sovereign nations. Border closures motivated by terrorism and arms smuggling concerns historically persist for weeks or months, not days. The research assistant found no additional information suggesting imminent reopening, which would likely be reported if negotiations were advanced. For the borders to reopen within 24 hours would require either: (1) extraordinary diplomatic intervention at the highest levels that we have no evidence of, or (2) pre-existing negotiations near completion that haven't been publicly reported. While theoretically possible, both scenarios are highly improbable given the brief timeframe and lack of signals. The forecast is not lower (not 0-1%) because diplomatic surprises do occasionally occur, and information asymmetry means decisions could be made that we're unaware of. The forecast is not higher because there's simply insufficient time for normal diplomatic processes to resolve complex security issues, and no credible reporting suggests reopening is imminent.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Benin re-open its closed land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Exclusive: Benin Rep.

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Benin's land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state that were closed in May 2025 are [credibly](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) reported to have been reopened.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-31.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
