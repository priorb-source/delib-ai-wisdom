    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — on April 30, 2025 the 250th-ranked person (Giancarlo Devasini) was listed as being from Italy, not the United States.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The composition around ranks ~230–270 remains dominated by non-U.S. billionaires, or non-U.S. markets/currencies outperform U.S. assets into late June, so a non-U.S. person occupies rank 250 on July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "U.S. equities and/or the U.S. dollar outperform into late June, or there’s normal churn at the margin that happens to place a U.S. billionaire at rank 250 on July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline composition argues against a U.S. median: the U.S. typically makes up well under 50% of the global billionaire pool and likely around 35–45% of the Bloomberg top 500, with non-U.S. representation particularly dense in the middle ranks. The latest concrete snapshot (Apr 30) shows a non-U.S. person at rank 250, so the status quo points to No. With about a month left, market and FX moves can reshuffle ranks near the cutoff, but the likelihood that the exact 250th slot is U.S. is roughly the U.S. share in that band, which is below 50%. Crypto, China/India moves, and USD strength/weakness are swing factors, but absent strong new information, the slow-to-change overall composition should dominate. Research assistant provided no additional information, so I’m leaning on base rates and the most recent observed median being non-U.S. Why not higher: U.S. share near the median is probably <50%, and the last observed median was non-U.S. Why not lower: the U.S. still commands a large fraction of the top 500; day-to-day churn plus potential U.S. outperformance or stronger USD by July 1 could easily place a U.S. billionaire at exactly rank 250. Upward updates: evidence that by mid-to-late June a U.S. billionaire frequently sits near rank 245–255; notable U.S. equity outperformance and/or USD strength versus EUR/CNY/INR. Downward updates: persistent non-U.S. occupancy of ranks ~245–255; U.S. underperformance or USD weakening versus major non-U.S. currencies.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the median person on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index be from the United States on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOn April 30, 2025, the 250th-ranked name on the list was Giancarlo Devasini of Italy\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the person ranked 250th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index (available at [this link](https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/)) is listed as being from the United States, when accessed by Metaculus Admins on or after July 1, 2025. It resolves as **No** if the 250th-ranked person is from any other country.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the \"median\" from the question's title is defined as the 250th ranked person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, no matter how many are on the list.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
