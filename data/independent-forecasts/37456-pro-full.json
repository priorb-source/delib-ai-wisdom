  "information": "On March 28, 2025, Cargill Kitchen Solutions recalled approximately 212,268 pounds of liquid egg products, including items under the Egg Beaters and Bob Evans brands. The recall was due to potential contamination with sodium hypochlorite, a cleaning solution. The affected products were produced on March 12 and 13, 2025, have 'use by' dates in August 2025 and March 2026, and bear the establishment number 'G1804' on the carton. The products were shipped to distributors in Ohio and Texas and for foodservice use in at least six other states, with potential for nationwide distribution.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has designated this a Class III recall. This classification is used when the use of or exposure to a violative product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences. No adverse health effects or illnesses have been reported in connection with the consumption of these products. Cargill stated the recall was issued 'out of an abundance of caution.'\n\nHistorical data on FSIS recalls shows that resolution times vary based on classification and complexity. Class I (high-risk) recalls typically close in 2-4 months. Class III recalls often close within 1-3 months, with a median time of approximately 90 days. However, recalls that span multiple states, involve large product volumes, or are distributed through institutional foodservice channels frequently take longer to resolve. The extended shelf life of some of the recalled products, until March 2026, is another factor that can complicate and lengthen the verification process.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "55 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The recall is currently designated as 'Active' by the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Due to the product's long shelf life (some with 'use by' dates in March 2026), its wide distribution to foodservice channels, and the large volume of product, FSIS recall effectiveness checks and verification that the product is out of commerce take longer than anticipated. The recall status remains 'Active' on July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cargill executes a highly efficient recall, quickly accounting for the majority of the product at the distributor level before it reaches end-users. They provide FSIS with comprehensive documentation of the product's recovery and disposal, satisfying the agency's requirements ahead of schedule and allowing them to change the status to 'Closed' before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an analysis of the recall's classification against its specific complicating factors. The core of this forecast weighs the typical timeline for a Class III recall against the challenges posed by this specific product's characteristics. The recall was issued on March 28, 2025, and the deadline is July 1, 2025, a period of approximately 95 days. Historical data indicates that the median closure time for a Class III recall is about 90 days, which places this question's timeline very close to the historical average, suggesting a starting probability near 50%. However, several factors lead me to adjust this probability downward. The most significant factor is the extended shelf life of some products, with 'use by' dates as late as March 2026. FSIS will not close a recall until it is confident the product is no longer in the stream of commerce. A long shelf life makes this verification difficult, as the product could remain in freezers at distribution centers, restaurants, or homes for an extended period, warranting a longer 'Active' notification period. Additional factors supporting a longer timeline are the large volume of the recall (over 200,000 pounds) and its wide distribution across multiple states and into foodservice channels, which complicates the process of tracing and verifying the disposition of all affected units. My probability is not lower than 35% because this is a Class III recall, the lowest-risk category, with no reported illnesses. This reduces the complexity and urgency compared to higher-risk recalls. Furthermore, Cargill is a large, sophisticated company likely possessing efficient systems for executing recalls. It is plausible their operational effectiveness could overcome the complicating factors within the timeframe. My probability is not higher than 35% because the combination of a very long shelf life, large volume, and multi-state distribution presents a substantial logistical challenge. The default regulatory stance in such a situation is caution, making a prolonged 'Active' status more likely than not. I would increase my forecast if there were reports that the vast majority of the product was contained at the distributor level. I would decrease it if any issues with product tracing were reported.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
