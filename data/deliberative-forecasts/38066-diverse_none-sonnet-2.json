    "review": "Both forecasters provide thoughtful analyses that overlap substantially with my reasoning but add valuable perspectives. Forecaster 3 raises a crucial historical precedent I overlooked: Altman interviewed Musk on a YC stage in 2016, proving such appearances are possible. However, the relationship has deteriorated significantly since then with active litigation. Forecaster 3's decomposition approach is methodologically superior to my holistic estimate - breaking down P(both attend in person) × P(overlap | both attend) reveals potential overconfidence in my forecast. The estimates of P(Musk attends) ~0.7-0.75 and P(overlap | both attend) ~0.15-0.20 seem reasonable, though the latter might be slightly high given active litigation rather than mere rivalry. Forecaster 2's reasoning is solid but the 20% forecast seems slightly optimistic about YC's ability to overcome the legal conflict barrier, and the 'surprise main event' scenario seems unlikely without any hints or leaks. Both correctly emphasize that the lack of any pre-event marketing or schedule details is strong evidence against a joint appearance, and both properly weight the adversarial relationship and litigation as major obstacles.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating downward from 18% to 15%. The key factors influencing this revision: (1) Forecaster 3's decomposition approach reveals I was slightly optimistic about both the probability of Musk attending and the conditional probability of overlap; (2) The active litigation between them is a more serious barrier than I initially weighted - this goes beyond professional rivalry to legal conflict; (3) While the 2016 precedent shows it's historically possible, the relationship deterioration and current lawsuits make that less relevant; (4) Musk's reputation for last-minute cancellations and changes is a real risk I underweighted. However, I'm not going all the way to 12% because: (1) YC has enormous incentive and influence to create a marquee moment; (2) The resolution criteria set a low bar - even a brief handoff or unplanned interaction counts; (3) Altman's deep YC ties make his attendance near-certain, and if Musk shows up in person (~70-75% likely), there remains a meaningful chance of some stage overlap for publicity. The lack of any announced joint session remains strong evidence against, but doesn't completely rule out an overlap.",
