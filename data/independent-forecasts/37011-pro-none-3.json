    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 11 days. The election is on May 1, 2025, with results expected on or around May 2, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Derbyshire County Council is currently controlled by the Conservative Party, with Labour as the main opposition. Reform UK holds no seats. The status quo is for either the Conservatives or Labour to win the most seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The election results in either the Conservative Party retaining the most seats (though likely with a reduced majority) or the Labour Party making significant gains to become the largest party. Reform UK may win a small number of seats but will not come close to challenging the two main parties for control.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A massive and unprecedented collapse in the Conservative vote, driven by national and local dissatisfaction, primarily benefits Reform UK rather than Labour. Capitalizing on a highly effective populist campaign in a pro-Leave county, Reform UK's polling surge translates into victories across numerous wards, allowing them to win a plurality of seats and become the largest party on the council.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant structural barriers facing a new party in the UK's First-Past-The-Post electoral system. The status quo is a Conservative-controlled council, with Labour as the established opposition. Reform UK currently holds zero of the 64 seats, meaning they would need a political earthquake to win the most seats. While they are polling in the teens nationally, this support is often too diffuse to win individual constituencies, a challenge that is even more pronounced at a local level where incumbency and established party machines are major advantages. For Reform UK to win, they would need not just a collapse of the Conservative vote, but for that vote to consolidate almost entirely behind them, rather than splitting with Labour, the Liberal Democrats, or independents. Such a dramatic realignment has little historical precedent in UK local elections.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 2% because the political environment is volatile, and Derbyshire is a region where Reform UK's message could resonate (it voted heavily to Leave the EU). An 'unusual' campaign, as noted by the BBC, suggests some unpredictability. This small probability accounts for a low-chance, high-impact event where voter discontent aligns perfectly for Reform.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the barriers are simply too immense. Starting from zero seats and overcoming the established two-party system in a single election is an extraordinary challenge. Without specific local polling showing a massive Reform UK lead, which is not available, a higher forecast would be unjustifiable speculation against the strong weight of historical and structural evidence.\n\nI would raise my forecast if credible local polling for Derbyshire emerged showing Reform UK in a competitive position to win a plurality of seats. I would lower it if reports indicated they had failed to field candidates in a large proportion of the county's wards.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Reform UK win the most seats in the 2025 Derbyshire County Council election?\n\nQuestion background:\nBBC: ['Unusual' election campaign under way in Derbyshire](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg41lzylq64o)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
