  "information": "As of late May 2025, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission is in Beirut for formal negotiations with the Lebanese government. The first negotiating session took place on May 29-30, with a second round scheduled for June 10. According to officials, a draft 46-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) worth approximately US$3 billion is being discussed. Lebanon's Finance Minister, Yassine Jaber, stated that there has been progress in the talks, describing them as being on a 'good track.' He also affirmed that the government's plan involves better collection of existing taxes rather than imposing new ones. The Lebanese negotiating team includes the Minister of Economy, the Governor of the Central Bank, and other experts, meeting with the IMF delegation led by Ernesto Rigo.\n\nThe IMF has conditioned an agreement on the implementation of several key reforms. While Lebanon has completed some prior actions, including passing amendments to the bank-secrecy law and establishing an electricity-tariff framework, significant obstacles remain. The passage of a bank-restructuring law and measures to control the cash economy are described as unresolved and politically contentious issues. The IMF has publicly characterized the progress in talks as 'slow' and has expressed specific concerns about provisions in the proposed banking reform law, including the composition of a 'Higher Banking Authority' and the scope of its powers.\n\nSeveral international actors are involved in Lebanon's economic recovery efforts. The European Union has announced that a 500 million euro aid payment is conditional on Lebanon restructuring its banking sector and securing an agreement with the IMF. Separately, the World Bank is in active discussions with Lebanese officials regarding a 'Lebanon Emergency Assistance Project' (LEAP) aimed at reconstruction. A meeting to present this project to donor countries and international institutions is scheduled for June 10. On the domestic front, Lebanese President Joseph Aoun has publicly emphasized the importance of reaching an agreement with the IMF before the summer of 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with a deadline of July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Negotiations continue to move slowly, bogged down by political disagreements over key reforms, particularly the bank restructuring law. The deadline passes without a final agreement being announced.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Political factions in Lebanon fail to reach a consensus on the contentious bank-restructuring law ahead of the July 1, 2025 deadline. The IMF mission concludes its visit, noting the lack of progress on this critical prior action, and no agreement is announced.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Intense domestic and international pressure, including the prospect of conditional EU aid, forces a rapid political compromise on the remaining reforms. Following the June 10 talks, the Lebanese parliament quickly passes a revised bank-restructuring law that satisfies IMF requirements, leading to a joint announcement of a Staff-Level Agreement on an Extended Fund Facility before the end of June.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant political hurdles that remain despite active negotiations. The primary factor driving this low probability is the extremely short timeframe of one month. While an IMF mission is in Beirut discussing a specific ~$3 billion deal, the IMF itself has characterized progress as 'slow' and has publicly flagged unresolved, contentious issues like the bank-restructuring law. Lebanon's political system has a long and consistent history of gridlock, especially concerning painful economic reforms. The status quo is one of protracted negotiations, not swift breakthroughs. Overcoming this deep-seated political inertia to pass complex and controversial legislation in just a few weeks represents a very high bar.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 20% because formal negotiations are indeed active, a specific draft agreement is being discussed, and there is immense pressure from the dire economic situation and international partners like the EU. The public urgency expressed by the Lebanese President and Finance Minister indicates some political will exists, which could, in a crisis, lead to a rapid compromise.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 20% because the obstacles are significant and historically intractable. The IMF's public statement about 'slow' progress and specific concerns about banking reform is a strong negative signal that outweighs the optimistic statements from Lebanese officials. The timeline is the most significant constraint.\n\nI would increase my forecast if reports from the June 10 meeting indicate a concrete breakthrough on the bank-restructuring law that is publicly endorsed by both the IMF and key Lebanese political blocs. I would decrease my forecast if the June 10 talks end in a stalemate or if the IMF mission departs without scheduling an immediate follow-up.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the IMF and Lebanon announce an agreement before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Lebanon finance minister confident of a new deal with IMF to help crumbling economy](https://www.newarab.com/news/lebanon-finance-minister-confident-new-deal-imf)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Lebanon and the International Monetary Fund announce any economic agreement between the two entities signed after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025. In order to count, it must involve the IMF agreeing to provide money to Lebanon, whether through loans, grants, or any other means.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, an International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission is in Beirut for formal negotiations with the Lebanese government.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
