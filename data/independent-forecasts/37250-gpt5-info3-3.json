  "information": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador around March 15, 2025, and is being held in a maximum-security prison. The President of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, has publicly labeled Garcia a 'terrorist' and has stated that he will not be released or returned to the United States. U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador to demand Garcia's release from prison, but reported that the U.S. embassy in El Salvador had not received instructions to assist in the matter.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 months (≈61 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "He remains in Salvadoran maximum-security detention through July 1 with no court order or diplomatic agreement enabling release or travel; no credible reports of entry into U.S. territory appear.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rapid diplomatic deal, court order, or humanitarian/legal parole results in his release and transfer, extradition, or travel that brings him onto U.S. soil (e.g., direct flight to the U.S. or transfer to U.S. custody) before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Status and incentives strongly favor No. Per the research assistant: (1) Garcia was deported to El Salvador around March 15, 2025 and is held in a maximum-security prison; (2) President Bukele has publicly labeled him a terrorist and vowed not to release or return him; (3) While Sen. Van Hollen visited to press for release, the U.S. embassy reportedly lacks instructions—suggesting no current, coordinated executive-branch push. With just ~61 days left, the base rate for quick release of a high-profile detainee in El Salvador’s current security environment is very low. Bukele’s public stance raises the domestic political cost of reversing course. Legally, a return would require either Salvadoran release (court or executive) plus travel arrangements, or a direct transfer to U.S. custody—both unlikely on this short timeline without a high-level bilateral agreement. Why not higher? A meaningful, fast-moving U.S. pressure campaign (White House/State statements, sanctions threats, or a negotiated swap) is not evident; and Bukele has clear political incentives to resist. Why not lower than this? Non-zero tail risks exist: sudden health/humanitarian grounds, a court ruling, a quiet bilateral deal, or a leadership decision to expel him to the U.S. to defuse diplomatic friction. What would move me up: public, on-the-record U.S. executive-branch demands; reports of negotiations; signs of Salvadoran prosecutorial withdrawal or court actions leading to release; credible reporting of planned transfer or travel documents. What would move me down: formal terrorism charges filed with court dates beyond July; Bukele reiterating refusal alongside legal steps that lock in long detention; lack of any U.S. government engagement beyond congressional visits.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Kilmar Abrego Garcia return to the United States before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation_of_Kilmar_Abrego_Garcia)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Kilmar Abrego Garcia after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 enters territory of the United States according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nSubsequently leaving the United States, such as a deportation, will not cause this question to re-resolve.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nKilmar Abrego Garcia was deported to El Salvador around March 15, 2025, and is being held in a maximum-security prison.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
