    "review": "The other forecasters raise several points worth considering. Forecaster 2's analysis closely mirrors mine, emphasizing the historical pattern of rhetoric without action, Serbia's constraining influence, and the immense costs of actually scheduling a referendum. Forecaster 3 makes two particularly valuable additions: (1) the 2016 RS Day referendum precedent, which demonstrates Dodik's willingness to hold controversial referendums despite international opposition, though on a less consequential issue than independence; and (2) the possibility of announcing a symbolically significant date like June 28 (Vidovdan), even if the actual referendum would occur after July 1. This is a clever observation that the question only requires announcement of a date, not that the date be before July 1. However, I note that the 2016 referendum was on RS Day observance - a far lower-stakes issue than independence, which would trigger far more severe consequences. All three forecasts converge in the 10-15% range, which suggests reasonable calibration. The key disagreement is whether the 2016 precedent and symbolic date possibility warrant moving from 10% to 15%.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find the convergence around 10-15% validates the core reasoning: extremely low base rate for scheduling independence referendums, strong international constraints, short timeframe, and historical pattern of threats without action. Forecaster 3's points about the 2016 referendum and symbolic dates are valid but warrant only modest updating. The 2016 RS Day referendum shows Dodik will defy international pressure, but independence is categorically different - it would trigger severe sanctions, strain Serbia ties, and risk economic collapse. The symbolic date observation is clever, but still requires RS authorities to take an unprecedented step of formally scheduling independence, which they've avoided for over a decade despite countless threats. No new information suggests imminent action in the next 60 days. I'm updating slightly upward from 10% to 12% to account for: (1) the 2016 precedent showing some willingness to hold controversial referendums, (2) the lower bar of merely announcing a date, and (3) the possibility of symbolic timing. However, I'm not going as high as 15% because the structural constraints remain overwhelming and there are no concrete signals of imminent action.",
