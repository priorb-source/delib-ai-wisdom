  "information": "Broader regional aviation activity and international interest in the area have seen recent developments. Dubai-based carrier flydubai announced the resumption of direct daily flights to Damascus, Syria, starting from June 1, 2025, after a 12-year suspension. This move is part of a wider effort to enhance regional connectivity. In a different development indicating tourism interest, British travel company Wild Frontiers is offering a 15-day tour of Iraq, which includes visits to historical sites such as the citadel of Erbil, despite official UK government warnings against travel to the country.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (from 2025-05-23 to 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Probably Yes (Erbil typically has low-to-mid 30s direct destinations in summer schedules)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security or regulatory disruptions (e.g., regional escalation, airport closure, insurance/overflight issues) prompt multiple suspensions—especially to Lebanon, parts of Iran, or Saudi Arabia—pushing the listed non-stop destinations on flightsfrom.com down to 31 or fewer by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seasonal summer adds (e.g., Antalya/Izmir/Sharm), plus stable Gulf/Turkey/Jordan/Egypt links and a handful of KSA/Kuwait/Qatar routes, keep or raise the flightsfrom.com EBL destination count to 32+ on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Definition: The question resolves Yes if flightsfrom.com/EBL lists >31 direct (non-stop) destinations on/after July 1, 2025. Summer seasonal routes count if scheduled.\n- Baseline/status quo: Erbil International Airport is one of Iraq’s busiest with broad regional connectivity (Turkey, Gulf, Jordan, Egypt, some domestic Iraqi routes, and occasional Caucasus/seasonal leisure). In recent years, EBL’s summer network typically sits around the low-to-mid 30s destinations. Given July 1 falls in peak season, the status quo points to a count at or above the threshold.\n- Positive indicators: Summer seasonal leisure routes (Antalya, Izmir, possibly Egyptian resorts) and strong Gulf/Turkey demand usually boost counts precisely around July. diaspora demand sometimes supports additional European or charter services that appear in schedule data. The assistant’s report about flydubai resuming Damascus isn’t directly about EBL, but it signals a modestly improving regional aviation climate. The tourism interest (e.g., UK tour offerings) is small in volume but directionally supportive.\n- Risks pulling the count below 32: Flights to Beirut or certain Iranian cities can be volatile; KSA routes can fluctuate with permitting; any renewed regional escalation or targeted disruptions around Erbil could lead to short-notice suspensions. Also, flightsfrom.com reflects schedule filings; if carriers cut seasonal services late or if data lags, some routes might not appear on the snapshot date.\n- Why not higher: Geopolitical and operational volatility in the region, plus the possibility that some marginal/seasonal routes don’t operate or aren’t reflected on July 1 specifically, cap confidence.\n- Why not lower: Seasonality favors a higher count exactly at the resolution date; Erbil’s core network (Turkey, UAE, Qatar, Jordan, Egypt, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi, domestic Iraq) provides a sturdy base near/above 30 even before seasonal adds.\n- What would move me up: Credible evidence that multiple seasonal routes (e.g., Antalya, Izmir, Sharm) and any Caucasus links are loaded and operating on/after July 1; confirmation that Beirut and several KSA points are active; flightsfrom.com snapshot showing 34+ in June.\n- What would move me down: News of airport closures, airspace restrictions, or multi-country suspensions (Lebanon, Iran, KSA) removing several destinations; flightsfrom.com showing ≤31 in mid/late June.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
