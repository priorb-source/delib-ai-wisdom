    "review": "The other two forecasters and I share a strong consensus on the fundamental dynamics of this question. We all agree that the status quo—no acknowledged calls since January and recent public statements from both sides denying any immediate plans for one—strongly favors a 'No' outcome. We also unanimously identify the upcoming high-level talks in Geneva on May 10-11 as the primary, albeit unlikely, catalyst that could lead to a 'Yes'. The other forecasters presented two arguments that I found particularly compelling. Forecaster 2 highlighted that Xi Jinping's concurrent meeting with Vladimir Putin could signal a hardened Chinese stance against the U.S., which I had not sufficiently weighted as a negative indicator for a potential Trump-Xi call. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the 'deep-seated nature' of the trade conflict and the 'formidable barrier' of distrust effectively articulated the powerful diplomatic inertia that makes a rapid breakthrough in the next month less probable. Both arguments convincingly suggest that my initial forecast may have been slightly too optimistic about the chances of a positive outcome from the Geneva talks.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 35% to 30%. My initial analysis was predicated on the Geneva talks in mid-May representing a significant chance for a breakthrough that would necessitate a leader-level call to formalize progress. While I maintain this is the most plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome, the other forecasters' analyses have convinced me to temper my optimism. Specifically, Forecaster 2’s point about Xi’s state visit to Russia is a crucial piece of countervailing evidence, suggesting China may be more focused on consolidating its anti-US partnerships than on rapprochement. This makes a conciliatory call with Trump less likely, even if the Geneva talks are moderately successful. Furthermore, Forecaster 3's argument about the deep-seated inertia of the conflict solidifies the view that even a positive meeting in Geneva is more likely to result in an agreement for further talks rather than an immediate, high-stakes call between the presidents. Therefore, I am adjusting my probability downwards by 5 percentage points to reflect a greater weighting on the strength of the status quo and the increased pessimism surrounding a diplomatic breakthrough.",
