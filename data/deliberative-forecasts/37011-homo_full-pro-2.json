    "review": "There is a strong consensus among all three forecasters. We have all identified the same critical factors that make a Reform UK victory extremely unlikely: the massive Conservative incumbent advantage (notionally 57 of 64 seats), the structural barrier of the First-Past-The-Post electoral system which punishes new parties with diffuse support, Reform UK's lack of established local infrastructure, and the historical precedent set by similar parties like UKIP. We also all agree that the high national polling for Reform and general political volatility create a small, non-zero chance of an upset. Forecaster 2's slightly lower forecast of 1% is a reasonable subjective judgment on the same set of facts, but it doesn't introduce any new evidence or a fundamentally different line of reasoning that would compel me to revise my own assessment downwards. The overall agreement strongly reinforces the initial analysis.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from the other forecasters, my forecast remains unchanged. The deliberation process has confirmed my initial reasoning, as the other experts independently identified the exact same core arguments. The convergence of our analyses on the primary barriers—incumbency and the electoral system—strengthens my confidence that these are the decisive factors. The historical precedent with UKIP, a party which also saw high national support, failing to translate that into control of county councils is a powerful piece of evidence that supports a very low probability. No new information or counterarguments were presented that would cause me to significantly re-evaluate the minuscule chances of a Reform victory. The fact that Forecaster 3 also arrived at a 2% forecast based on the same logic further solidifies my position. This figure accurately reflects the monumental, almost unprecedented, scale of the political upset required for Reform UK to go from zero seats to a plurality, while acknowledging it is not an absolute impossibility in a volatile political climate.",
