    "review": "The other forecasters and I are closely aligned in our analysis, all citing the same key factors: 26 days remaining, no announcement yet, Byron Donalds leading with Trump's endorsement, and absence of signals about campaign infrastructure. Forecaster 3 raises an interesting point that Casey DeSantis being included in polling suggests she was 'clearly considering the race,' but I'd counter that being polled as a newsworthy figure doesn't equate to serious campaign planning. All three of us acknowledge that 26 days is technically sufficient time for an announcement, but differ slightly on how much weight to give various factors. The spread between 12-20% reflects reasonable disagreement about the strength of status quo bias versus the possibility of rapid political developments. Forecaster 2's emphasis on Trump's endorsement being 'particularly meaningful in Florida Republican politics' is well-taken and reinforces the unfavorable environment for a DeSantis announcement.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find our reasoning highly convergent but will update slightly higher. The key consideration is whether I'm overweighting the absence of announcement signals. While I still believe the lack of campaign infrastructure, fundraising activity, or media reports about an imminent announcement is highly significant this close to the deadline, there's some wisdom in the crowd - three independent forecasters clustering between 12-20% suggests the true probability likely falls in that range. However, I don't see compelling new evidence or arguments that warrant a substantial update. The fundamental calculus remains: we're in early June with zero signals of an announcement, Trump has endorsed a rival, and polling shows an unfavorable environment. Political announcements at this level require preparation we simply aren't seeing. I'll move from 12% to 14% as a modest acknowledgment that I may be slightly too bearish on the possibility of a late-June surprise announcement, but I remain skeptical that Casey DeSantis will announce before July 1.",
