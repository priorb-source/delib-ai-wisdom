    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The government of Alberta continues to focus on asserting provincial autonomy within Canada but does not take the step of officially scheduling an independence referendum.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without any announcement. The provincial government, while maintaining a confrontational stance with Ottawa on policy, deems calling a referendum too politically risky and destabilizing, preferring to use existing tools like the Sovereignty Act to pursue its agenda.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and severe conflict erupts between the Alberta and federal governments, for instance, over a new federal environmental policy that cripples the oil and gas sector. In response, Premier Danielle Smith makes a dramatic, populist announcement to schedule a referendum as a tool to pressure Ottawa and rally her base, bypassing normal legislative timelines.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the extremely short timeframe and the significant political inertia against such a monumental action. The status quo is that while Alberta separatism is a recurring political theme, the current government's strategy is focused on maximizing autonomy within Canada via mechanisms like the 'Sovereignty Act', not on outright separation. Scheduling a referendum is a momentous step that would typically be preceded by months, if not years, of political groundwork, public consultation, and legislative debate; none of this is currently happening. To announce a referendum before July 1, 2025, would require a sudden, major political crisis to force the Premier's hand.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 2% because the relationship between Alberta and the federal government is tense, and Premier Danielle Smith has demonstrated a willingness to engage in unpredictable, headline-grabbing political manoeuvres. An unforeseen event could theoretically trigger a reactive announcement. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the political, economic, and logistical barriers to calling a referendum on such short notice are immense. It would likely face strong opposition from the business community, moderate voters, and even factions within the Premier's own party. Without any preparatory steps being taken, such an announcement is highly improbable. \n\nI would increase my forecast if senior government officials begin publicly discussing a referendum as an imminent option or if a major new federal-provincial conflict erupts. I would decrease it if the Premier explicitly rules out a referendum for the foreseeable future.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
