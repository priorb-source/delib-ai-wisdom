    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling arguments I underweighted in my initial analysis. Most critically, Forecaster 3 highlights that only the literal words 'tariff' or 'tariffs' count - synonyms like 'duties' or 'levies' don't qualify. This is a significant technical point that increases the probability of a clean day. Forecaster 2 makes a strong statistical argument: achieving unbroken daily front-page coverage across TWO papers for 35+ consecutive days is actually a very high bar, even for major stories. The news cycle volatility argument is persuasive. Both forecasters also emphasize that we only need ONE clean day out of ~36 remaining days, which I acknowledged but didn't weight heavily enough. The EU deadline delay to July 9 (after the resolution window) is more significant than I initially credited - it removes immediate deadline pressure during June. However, I remain somewhat more cautious than Forecasters 2 and 3 based on: (1) The May 20-25 data showing the word appeared on at least one front page every day, indicating current high salience; (2) WSJ's 'What's News' format creating sticky daily mentions; (3) The requirement that BOTH papers omit simultaneously on the same day, not just one; (4) Trump's continued active focus on tariff policy creating ongoing news flow.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' arguments, I need to update upward significantly. I underweighted three key factors: (1) The synonym exclusion - if papers discuss trade using 'duties,' 'levies,' or 'trade barriers,' this doesn't count, substantially increasing the chance of a technical clean day; (2) The statistical challenge of maintaining perfect daily coverage across two different papers for 35+ consecutive days - even major stories have occasional gaps; (3) The EU deadline being pushed to July 9 removes immediate urgency from June coverage. I was too anchored on the story's strength rather than the technical resolution criteria. That said, I won't go as high as 70-75% because the recent May 20-25 data shows continued daily mentions, WSJ's format favors frequent appearances, and both papers must simultaneously omit the word. The requirement for simultaneous omission across two papers with different editorial focuses is a meaningful constraint. I'm updating from 28% to 55%, acknowledging the strong arguments for higher probability while maintaining some caution based on recent evidence and the dual-omission requirement.",
