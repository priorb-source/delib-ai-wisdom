  "information": "The recall was initiated by Johnsonville LLC on April 5, 2025, for approximately 22,672 pounds of its cheddar bratwurst product due to potential contamination with hard plastic. The affected products were produced on a single date, February 5, 2025, and bear the establishment number 'Est. 1647'. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) classified this as a Class I recall, indicating a high health risk. The recall was prompted by two consumer complaints, but no confirmed injuries have been reported. The product was distributed to retail locations in ten states: Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The FSIS has noted concerns that the product may still be in consumers' freezers.\n\nThe FSIS follows a structured process for closing recalls. This process involves verifying that the recalling firm has notified all its customers, confirming that the product has been removed from circulation, conducting effectiveness checks to ensure the product is no longer available to consumers, and verifying that the company has implemented corrective actions. For Class I recalls, which are deemed high-risk, the FSIS enforces more rigorous verification requirements before it can be closed. Recalls involving foreign material contamination necessitate a comprehensive investigation into the source of the contaminant and the implementation of effective preventive measures.\n\nHistorical data on similar FSIS recalls provides context for typical closure timelines. Many previous recalls handled by Johnsonville were closed within 4 to 8 weeks. Broader data for Class I meat recalls of a similar size often shows closure within 2 to 4 months after the announcement. However, some cases can take longer; a recall for Tyson Fun Nuggets in 2023 took approximately four months to close. A January 2025 report from the Plastic Pollution Coalition also mentioned that several recalls from 2024 involving plastic contamination remained ongoing for several months after their initiation.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "53 days remain until July 1, 2025, the resolution date for this question.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall remains Active as of today and would likely still be Active on July 1, 2025 if current pace continues",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FSIS verification process extends beyond July 1, 2025 due to the rigorous requirements for Class I recalls, challenges confirming product removal from consumers' freezers, delays in verifying Johnsonville's corrective actions, or complications in investigating the source of plastic contamination.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Johnsonville efficiently completes all customer notifications and product removal verification within the next few weeks. The company quickly implements corrective actions to prevent future contamination, and FSIS completes its effectiveness checks and closes the recall by mid-June, well before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The recall was issued April 5, 2025, making it 34 days old as of today (May 9). The question resolves on July 1, creating an 87-day total window from recall initiation to resolution date, with 53 days remaining. Historical data provides mixed signals. Johnsonville's previous recalls often closed within 4-8 weeks (28-56 days), which would suggest possible closure between May 3 and June 1. However, Class I recalls of similar size typically take 2-4 months (60-120 days), placing the median around 90 days - just beyond our July 1 deadline. The Tyson case taking approximately 4 months and several 2024 plastic contamination recalls remaining open for months suggest caution. Several factors favor a longer timeline: (1) This is a Class I recall requiring rigorous FSIS verification, (2) Only 34 of 87 days have elapsed - still relatively early in the process, (3) Product may remain in consumers' freezers complicating removal verification, (4) Plastic contamination requires thorough source investigation and preventive measures. Factors potentially favoring closure: (1) Limited scope - only 22,672 pounds across 10 states, (2) Single production date (Feb 5) makes tracking simpler, (3) Johnsonville's experience with recalls, (4) No confirmed injuries reported. The status quo strongly suggests the recall will remain Active. At 34 days in, we're past the lower end of typical Johnsonville timelines (4 weeks) but not yet at the upper end (8 weeks = 56 days, which would be June 1). The 87-day total window is below the 2-4 month median, making closure before July 1 possible but not probable. I'm not more bearish because Johnsonville's track record shows capability for relatively quick resolutions, and the limited scope could facilitate faster verification. I'm not more bullish because Class I requirements are stringent, we're still early in the process, and the 87-day window is compressed compared to typical Class I timelines. I would update higher if we saw evidence the recall status changed to 'Closed' or movement toward closure in coming weeks, or if Johnsonville announced completion of key milestones. I would update lower if June arrives with the recall still Active and no signs of imminent closure.",
