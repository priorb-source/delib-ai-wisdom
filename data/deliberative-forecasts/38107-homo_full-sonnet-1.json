    "review": "All three forecasters converge on a low probability (4-10%), which strengthens confidence in the core assessment. We all identify the same key barriers: compressed timeline, no charges filed yet, First Amendment protections, 2023 Supreme Court precedent on subjective intent, and the historical rarity of arresting former FBI directors. Forecaster 3 raises a valid point about the hostile political environment that I perhaps underweighted - political pressure combined with an active investigation does create some upside risk. However, Forecaster 3's 10% seems slightly high given they acknowledge all the same legal barriers. The gap between 4-10% reflects different weighting of political pressure versus legal/institutional constraints. Forecaster 2's 5% is essentially aligned with my 4%. No truly new evidence was presented, but the emphasis on political environment as a countervailing factor is worth considering more carefully.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe my initial 4% was slightly too confident given the active investigation and political pressure. While the legal barriers remain formidable and the status quo strongly suggests no arrest will occur, I should give more weight to the possibility of politically-motivated action in an unusual environment. The 2023 Supreme Court ruling and First Amendment protections are powerful barriers, but they're not absolute - prosecutors could still attempt to argue subjective intent based on other evidence. The time constraint (31 days) remains severe for normal legal process, but emergency or expedited proceedings are technically possible if there were strong political will. However, I'm not moving all the way to 10% because: (1) weeks have already passed without charges, (2) Comey was interviewed and released, suggesting insufficient grounds for immediate custody, (3) the legal standards are genuinely very high, and (4) institutional resistance to arresting former FBI directors is extremely strong. A probability of 6% better reflects the balance between acknowledging political pressure while maintaining that legal and institutional barriers make arrest highly unlikely.",
