    "review": "I found the other two analyses very helpful, particularly Forecaster 3's. Their key insight, which I had not sufficiently weighed, is the strict interpretation of the resolution criteria: an 'agreement to provide money' likely requires IMF Executive Board approval, not just a Staff-Level Agreement (SLA). Forecaster 3's detailed breakdown of the post-SLA procedural timeline—completing prior actions, drafting and circulating the Board paper, and securing a Board meeting—makes the sub-31-day timeframe seem extraordinarily tight. Forecaster 2's reminder of the failed 2022 SLA serves as a potent base-rate argument against a swift resolution, reinforcing the view that Lebanon's political system struggles immensely with follow-through on difficult reforms. Both analyses have convinced me that my initial forecast was too optimistic.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly decreasing my forecast from 20% to 10%. The primary driver for this change is the revised understanding of the resolution criteria, prompted by Forecaster 3's analysis. My initial forecast implicitly assumed that an announced Staff-Level Agreement (SLA) might be sufficient. I now believe that IMF Executive Board approval is required for the IMF to have formally 'agreed to provide money.' This adds several time-consuming and politically fraught steps to the process that cannot realistically be completed before July 1. Even if negotiators reach an SLA around their June 10 meeting, the Lebanese parliament would then need to pass contentious and unresolved prior actions, most notably a bank-restructuring law. Given Lebanon's history of political paralysis on such matters—as highlighted by the failure to implement reforms after the 2022 SLA—the probability of achieving this in approximately two weeks is extremely low. The IMF's own public assessment of 'slow' progress further suggests that the gap between the two sides on these key reforms remains wide. The combination of a high procedural bar and deep-seated political obstacles within a very short timeframe makes a 'Yes' outcome highly improbable.",
