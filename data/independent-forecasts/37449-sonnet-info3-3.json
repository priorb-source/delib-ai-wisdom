  "information": "According to US military leaders, the upcoming 2025 National Defense Strategy (NDS) will prioritize \"preventing a Chinese attack on Taiwan\" as the sole major assumption scenario. This represents a strategic shift to focus on the Indo-Pacific region. At the same time, US Admiral Samuel Paparo has warned that China is rapidly increasing its production of warships and submarines relative to the US, stating a production ratio of 6 to 1.8 for warships and 2 to 1.4 for submarines. Paparo stated that while the US would prevail in a conflict now, its military forces are on a \"bad trajectory.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days remain until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - currently there is no indication that China is blockading Taiwan or that the US has accused China of doing so",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China continues its current pattern of military exercises and gray zone operations around Taiwan without implementing an actual blockade of Taiwanese seaports. Any military activities remain below the threshold that would prompt a formal US government accusation of blockading.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "China initiates a naval quarantine or blockade operation that restricts commercial or military access to one or more Taiwanese ports, perhaps in response to a political development or as part of a larger military exercise. The US government issues a public statement formally accusing China of blockading Taiwan.",
    "rationale": "This forecast strongly weighs toward the status quo given the very short timeframe of 56 days. While the research assistant's information confirms heightened US focus on Taiwan defense and China's accelerating naval buildup, these are long-term strategic trends rather than indicators of imminent action. A blockade would represent an unprecedented escalation requiring significant military positioning and coordination - activities that would likely be detected well in advance. Historically, China has employed military exercises, air incursions, and gray zone tactics rather than outright blockades. The question also requires two conditions: (1) China must actually blockade Taiwan AND (2) the US must publicly accuse them - not just observe or respond privately. For my forecast to move higher, I would need credible intelligence reporting of Chinese naval forces massing for blockade operations, significant political triggers (like a Taiwanese independence declaration), or signs of imminent crisis. For it to move lower from an already low baseline, I would need explicit reassurances of stability or evidence that China is demobilizing forces. Given no current signs of imminent blockade and the brevity of the remaining period, status quo persistence is overwhelmingly likely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of blockading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWSJ via MSN: [China Is Ready to Blockade Taiwan. Here’s How.](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/china-is-ready-to-blockade-taiwan-here-s-how/ar-AA1BvnW8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of blockading at least one of Taiwan's seaports without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to US military leaders, the upcoming 2025 National Defense Strategy (NDS) will prioritize \"preventing a Chinese attack on Taiwan\" as the sole major assumption scenario.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
