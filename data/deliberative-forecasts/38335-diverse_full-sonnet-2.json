    "review": "All three forecasters converged on remarkably similar estimates (17-20%) with largely overlapping reasoning, which increases my confidence in this range. Forecaster 2 makes an excellent point I should weight more heavily: that a late summer or fall 2025 launch would still be well within the typical timeframe for Florida gubernatorial campaigns, which reduces the strategic urgency for a pre-July announcement. Forecaster 3 correctly notes that high-profile figures can pivot quickly, but this theoretical possibility is undermined by the complete absence of any preparation signals - no staff hires, no donor cultivation leaks, no event holds. The convergence on key factors is striking: all three of us independently identified the lack of campaign infrastructure, the Hope Florida probe complications, Trump's endorsement of Donalds, and the June 30 fundraising deadline as the critical variables. The very tight 26-day window combined with zero observable preparation strongly favors the status quo holding.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find their reasoning sound and consistent with my own assessment. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the strategic soundness of delay is particularly compelling - there's genuinely no rush to announce by July 1 when fall 2025 would still provide 11+ months before the primary. This somewhat reduces the weight I should place on the June 30 fundraising deadline as a forcing function. However, I still believe 18% appropriately captures the small but non-trivial possibility of a surprise announcement timed to that deadline. The complete absence of campaign preparation signals (which all three of us noted) is the strongest indicator against a near-term announcement. Political headwinds from the probe and Trump backing Donalds reinforce this. While Forecaster 3 rightly notes that high-profile candidates can move quickly, 26 days is extremely short even for a rapid pivot, especially with no leaks or signals whatsoever. The clustering of all three independent forecasts in the 17-20% range, using similar reasoning and evidence, suggests this is a well-calibrated estimate. I see no compelling reason to adjust my forecast.",
