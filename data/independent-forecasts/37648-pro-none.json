    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new nuclear deal is announced, and the current state of high tensions, significant Iranian nuclear advancement, and heavy US sanctions remains in place.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite back-channel talks, deep-seated mistrust, domestic political opposition in both Washington and Tehran, and disagreements over the scope of sanctions relief and nuclear rollback prevent a formal agreement. The short timeframe expires with both sides maintaining their hardline public positions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by a mutual desire to de-escalate regional tensions and avoid a crisis over Iran's advancing nuclear program, US and Iranian negotiators, facilitated by a third party like Oman, agree to a limited, 'less-for-less' deal. This agreement, which freezes Iran's high-level uranium enrichment in exchange for targeted sanctions relief on oil sales and access to frozen assets, is formally announced before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong inertia of the status quo. The primary obstacles to a deal are immense and structural: deep-seated mutual distrust, powerful domestic political opposition in both nations, and a wide gap in core demands regarding nuclear restrictions and sanctions relief. International agreements of this complexity typically require many months, if not years, of negotiation; reaching one in under two months is a significant challenge.\n\nThe Israeli media report suggesting a 'high chance' of a deal is the most significant piece of information pushing towards a 'Yes' outcome. It implies that substantive, secret negotiations may be further along than is publicly known. This prevents me from setting a probability in the single digits. Both sides also share a fundamental interest in avoiding a direct military conflict, which a limited, interim agreement could help achieve.\n\nHowever, I am weighting the structural obstacles more heavily than this single media report, which could be speculative or part of a political signaling campaign. The political cost for any US administration to sign a deal, and for the Iranian leadership to be seen as capitulating, remains exceedingly high. Therefore, while a deal is not impossible, it is improbable.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were public statements from high-level US or Iranian officials confirming direct talks or a narrowing of positions. I would decrease my forecast in response to any significant regional escalation involving Iran or its proxies, or if Iran announced a major new advancement in its nuclear program, which would likely kill any diplomatic track.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States and Iran announce a new nuclear deal before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nIsraeli media (Hebrew): [Senior ministers were informed: There is a high chance that the US and Iran will reach an agreement](https://www.kan.org.il/content/kan-news/politic/895178/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the US and Iran sign or announce an agreement with respect to Iran's nuclear program.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
