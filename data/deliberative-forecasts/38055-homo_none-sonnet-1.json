    "review": "Both forecasters provide valuable structure by explicitly breaking down the problem into two independent probabilities: P(fight happens) × P(Pyfer wins | fight happens). This is methodologically cleaner than my initial approach. All three analyses converge on similar cancellation risk estimates (15-25%), though we all note the rebooked nature adds some uncertainty. The key differentiator is Forecaster 3's assertion that Gastelum is 'declining' with 'recent vulnerabilities,' which would favor Pyfer more strongly (55-65% win probability vs. 50-55%). However, without access to current betting odds, recent fight results, or detailed performance metrics, I cannot independently verify this claim. Forecaster 3's final forecast of 52% appears inconsistent with their stated calculation (0.77 × 0.60 = 46%), suggesting either different actual inputs or rounding. Forecaster 2's 42% represents the more conservative end, while Forecaster 3's 52% is more optimistic. My original 45% sits squarely in the middle of this range.",
    "rationale": "Using the structured two-step approach the other forecasters employed: P(fight happens) = ~75% (accounting for 20-25% historical cancellation rate, slightly elevated for a rebooked fight), and P(Pyfer wins | fight happens) = ~55% (modest favoritism if Gastelum is declining, but maintaining uncertainty given limited concrete information about current form, training camps, or odds). This yields: 0.75 × 0.55 = 41.25%, which aligns with Forecaster 2. However, there's legitimate uncertainty in both components. If fight completion is slightly higher (77%) or Pyfer's conditional win probability is slightly higher (58%), we approach 45%. Without additional concrete evidence about Gastelum's decline or Pyfer's current form, I maintain my original forecast of 45%, which represents the middle ground between conservative and optimistic scenarios and acknowledges genuine two-sided uncertainty.",
