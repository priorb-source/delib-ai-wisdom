    "review": "The other two forecasters presented reasoning that strongly aligns with my own, centered on the prohibitive nature of the compressed timeline and the significant bureaucratic hurdle of signature verification. We all agree that the less than two months remaining is the primary driver for a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 3's specific mention of Premier Smith publicly targeting 2026 for a potential referendum is a compelling piece of evidence that strengthens the case that there is no political will to rush this process. Forecaster 2's slightly higher probability of 10% hinges on the idea that an 'unexpected political event' could create pressure to expedite the process. While I agree political volatility is a factor, I find their probability too high, as it seems to underestimate the logistical inertia of an independent body like Elections Alberta and the sheer time required to properly verify 177,000 signatures. The deliberation has reinforced my conviction in my initial forecast.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 5%. The deliberation with my peers has solidified my reasoning. The primary obstacle remains the timeline. As of May 7, 2025, a citizen petition has not even been formally submitted to Elections Alberta. The subsequent process of verifying approximately 177,000 signatures is a meticulous administrative task that is logistically infeasible to complete in the less than eight weeks remaining before the July 1 deadline. My confidence in this assessment is increased by Forecaster 3's point that Premier Smith herself has indicated a 2026 timeline for any potential referendum, which signals a clear lack of political desire from the top to meet the question's deadline. While Forecaster 2 correctly identifies that political volatility could create pressure, this pressure is highly unlikely to be sufficient to compel an independent electoral body to bypass its standard procedures and complete weeks or months of work in such a short period. The path to a 'Yes' outcome is blocked by concrete, sequential, and time-consuming administrative steps that have not yet begun.",
