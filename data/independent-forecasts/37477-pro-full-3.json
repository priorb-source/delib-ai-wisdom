  "information": "Executives from major publishers, including The New York Times and News Corp, stated confidence in their businesses' ability to grow despite economic uncertainties from tariffs. In Q1 2025, The New York Times reported a 12% growth in digital advertising revenue, while most other publishers saw flat revenue. New York Times executives described the impact of tariffs as 'immaterial.' This contrasts with a survey indicating 54% of marketers plan to reduce their 2025 budgets due to tariff concerns. Following a Federal Reserve statement that it would wait for the full impact of tariffs before making decisions, communications-services stocks declined, though The New York Times and Walt Disney posted positive results.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's editorial board described a trade deal with the United Kingdom as a step towards unwinding the trade war, writing that the economic damage from tariffs was proving politically risky. The board also has stated that the tariff policy has shaken global confidence in U.S. reliability and called it a 'true gift' to Chinese President Xi Jinping. In April 2025, President Trump suggested tariffs could replace income taxes, a claim that a Wall Street Journal reporter noted reasons to be skeptical of. Following the implementation of tariffs, the Treasury Department raised its borrowing projection for the April-June 2025 quarter to an estimated net marketable borrowing of $514 billion.\n\nAn executive order signed on April 2, 2025, imposes a 10% 'minimum benchmark tariff' on all trade partners, with higher tariffs on certain partners. Reports since the order indicate a 'precautionary consumption' trend in the US, with consumers stockpiling goods. The arrival of container ships from China, which supplies 77% of toys sold in the US, has reportedly fallen by 50%. In March 2025, the Cortland Standard, a 147-year-old newspaper in New York, ceased publication, citing rising costs, including a 25% tariff on newsprint from Canada, as a contributing factor.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The economic and political fallout from the April 2, 2025 executive order on tariffs continues to be a major news story. Ongoing discussions about supply chains, consumer prices, international retaliation, and President Trump's statements ensure the word 'tariff' appears on the front page of at least one of the two newspapers every day through the end of May 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "On one or more days before June 1, 2025, a separate, major breaking news event—such as a significant natural disaster or a major non-trade geopolitical development—dominates the news cycle, pushing all tariff-related news off the front pages of both The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal simultaneously.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the extremely high news salience of tariffs in the specified period. The status quo outcome is 'No' because the world changes slowly, and recent events have dramatically increased, not decreased, the media focus on tariffs.\n\nThe research indicates that President Trump signed a major executive order on April 2, 2025, imposing new 'minimum benchmark' tariffs. This is not an old story fading away; it is a recent, large-scale policy change with ongoing and escalating consequences. The reported effects—such as 'precautionary consumption' by consumers, a 50% drop in container ships from China, and increased Treasury borrowing projections—are all classic front-page stories for both the general-interest New York Times and the business-focused Wall Street Journal. Furthermore, the President's suggestion that tariffs could replace income taxes and criticism from the WSJ's own editorial board guarantees the topic remains a central part of the political and economic discourse.\n\nFor the question to resolve 'Yes', the word 'tariff(s)' must disappear from both front pages on the same day. Given the story's broad impact, this is highly unlikely. The timeframe is only 23 days, leaving little time for this major story to lose its front-page relevance.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 11% because the news cycle is inherently unpredictable. Over 23 days, there is a non-trivial chance of a slow news day (e.g., a weekend) or a sufficiently large, unrelated breaking news event that could momentarily displace the tariff story from both front pages. A single such day is all that is required for a 'Yes' resolution.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 11% because of the sheer momentum and multifaceted nature of the tariff story. It affects international relations, corporate strategy, government finance, and consumer wallets, making it relevant to a wide range of front-page sections. The likelihood that editors at both major newspapers would simultaneously decide there is nothing newsworthy to report about tariffs on their front pages is very low on any given day. For this not to happen even once in 23 days is the most probable outcome.\n\nI would increase my forecast if a massive, all-consuming news story were to break (e.g., a major war or domestic crisis). I would decrease it if President Trump or a major trade partner were to announce a further escalation in trade policy.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff(s)\" disappear from the front print pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal by June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\n\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. When, if ever, will we seen tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve to \"Yes\" if, after \\[OPEN DATE] and before June 1, 2025, the words, \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\", do not appear on the print front page of The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.

Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\nGrammar is not relevant (e.g. \"TARIFF\" will suffice to prevent a \"No\" resolution).\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, it does not have to be in a title.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nExecutives from major publishers, including The New York Times and News Corp, stated confidence in their businesses' ability to grow despite economic uncertainties from tariffs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
