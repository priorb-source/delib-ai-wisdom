    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most compelling new argument that significantly shifts my analysis: the confidential S-1 filing pathway. Companies frequently file S-1s confidentially first, then make them public closer to the actual IPO. If Discord is targeting a fall 2025 IPO (September-November, which is common for tech companies), the natural timeline would be a public S-1 filing in late August - after the July 1 deadline. This is a critical insight I underweighted. Forecaster 3 also correctly notes that companies rarely make standalone blog announcements about IPO plans due to regulatory considerations, making that resolution path unlikely. The June holiday timing argument further reduces the probability of a late-June announcement. Forecaster 2's 75% seems too optimistic - while hiring investment banks signals genuine intent, it doesn't dictate the specific timing of public announcements. The evidence supports Discord planning a 2025 IPO, but not necessarily a pre-July 1 public announcement. Forecaster 2 may be conflating 'IPO preparation' with 'imminent public announcement.'",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find Forecaster 3's reasoning most persuasive and realize I underweighted key timing dynamics. The confidential filing mechanism is crucial: Discord can pursue a 2025 IPO while filing confidentially now and only going public in August (post-deadline). Given typical tech IPO patterns favor fall listings with late-summer public S-1s, a pre-July 1 public filing would indicate an unusually aggressive summer IPO timeline. The regulatory considerations around blog announcements also make that path less likely than I initially thought. My original 40% gave too much weight to the 'credible evidence of IPO plans' without sufficient consideration of standard IPO timing mechanics. However, I won't go as low as 32% because 39 days remains material time, market conditions could prompt acceleration, and the March report's specificity suggests advanced preparation. Some companies do move faster than typical patterns. My updated view splits the difference: the evidence strongly supports a 2025 IPO, but the structural timing arguments suggest the public announcement more likely comes after July 1.",
