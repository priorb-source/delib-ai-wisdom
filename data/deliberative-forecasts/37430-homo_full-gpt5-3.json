    "review": "Both forecasters’ reasoning aligns with the key facts and process risks I cited. New/clarified points they add: (1) the Senate could adopt the House version with minimal changes, materially reducing harmonization delays; (2) concrete process signals to watch (committee reports, Order Paper scheduling, public prioritization by Senate leadership); (3) downside risks from potential strikes or recess compressing June floor time; (4) the VAT exemption could be traded off if revenue pressures intensify; and (5) even late‑June passage can still be enacted quickly via prompt presidential assent, so the 30‑day assent window isn’t a binding delay. I find these arguments generally convincing, especially the clarification that immediate assent is feasible and the emphasis on scheduling signals. The trade‑off/revenue‑risk is a useful counterbalance that I hadn’t explicitly weighed. Overall, their inputs nudge me slightly upward from my prior, but timing and political risks still argue against a large move.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is roughly eight weeks. The House has passed the bill; the Senate and potential harmonization remain, followed by presidential assent. Executive alignment, House momentum, and the political palatability of the VAT exemption support passage before July 1. Importantly, the president can assent immediately, mitigating my earlier emphasis on the 30‑day window as a timing constraint. However, risks remain: Senate amendments prompting harmonization, calendar compression around June (including potential recess/industrial action), and broader opposition to other elements of the package that could slow floor time or force renegotiation. There’s also some risk—albeit modest—that revenue concerns lead to re‑scoping or deferral of the exemption. Balancing these, I move slightly up from 60% to reflect feasible quick passage/assent pathways and House‑to‑Senate alignment, while maintaining a healthy discount for process and timing slippage.",
