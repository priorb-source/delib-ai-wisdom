  "information": "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has taken a vocal stance on the conflict in Gaza, describing the situation as a 'genocide' and vowing to raise Spain's voice to end the 'massacre.' In May 2024, his government officially recognized the State of Palestine, and Spain is expected to impose sanctions on Israel. Sánchez is also pushing for stronger EU action, including a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Domestically, his activities include efforts for Catalan language recognition and social policies such as early retirement reforms.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Based on the most recent publicly available Morning Consult data from late May 2024, Pedro Sánchez's approval rating (33%) is slightly higher than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's (31%).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's approval rating sees a modest boost due to a popular nationalist or economic announcement, while Pedro Sánchez's rating dips slightly amid ongoing domestic controversies, causing Erdoğan's rating to equal or surpass Sánchez's by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Persistent economic challenges in Turkey, particularly high inflation, continue to suppress Erdoğan's approval rating. Meanwhile, Sánchez's approval rating remains relatively stable, preventing Erdoğan from closing the narrow gap between them.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the current, albeit narrow, lead Pedro Sánchez holds over Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Morning Consult's approval tracker (33% vs. 31% as of late May 2024). Over the short, one-month timeframe until resolution, the status quo is a strong predictor. Both leaders face significant challenges, but the nature of these challenges suggests Sánchez is more likely to maintain his lead. Erdoğan's unpopularity is deeply rooted in Turkey's severe and persistent economic crisis, including high inflation, which was a key factor in his party's major losses in the March 2024 local elections. Such fundamental economic discontent is a powerful anchor on an incumbent's approval rating and is unlikely to reverse significantly in just one month. Sánchez, on the other hand, faces primarily political challenges, such as controversy over the Catalan amnesty law. While this polarizes the electorate, his recent high-profile foreign policy actions, like recognizing the state of Palestine, are popular with his base and may solidify his support, creating a stable floor for his approval rating. Therefore, the structural economic headwinds facing Erdoğan appear more severe and difficult to overcome in the short term than the political headwinds facing Sánchez. My probability is not higher because the current gap is very small and within the typical margin of error for such polls; a minor event or polling fluctuation could easily flip the result. It is not lower because the deep-seated economic issues in Turkey make a significant recovery in Erdoğan's approval rating in the next month highly improbable.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez have a higher approval rating than Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Pedro Sánchez has a higher approval rating than Recep Tayyip Erdoğan according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez has taken a vocal stance on the conflict in Gaza, describing the situation as a 'genocide' and vowing to raise Spain's voice to end the 'massacre.' In May 2024, his government officially recognized the State of Palestine, and Spain is expected to impose sanctions on Israel.

Domestically, his activities include efforts for Catalan language recognition and social policies such as early retirement reforms.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
