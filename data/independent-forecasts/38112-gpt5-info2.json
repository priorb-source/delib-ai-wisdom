  "information": "At the 16th BRICS Summit, a 'partner country' framework was introduced. Of the initial invitees, Indonesia has since become a full member. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed their participation in the partner framework. On May 30, 2025, Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev publicly ruled out seeking full membership, stating that his country would maintain its observer status. He cited the organization's lack of permanent structures and a formal charter as reasons for this decision.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks (until around 00:00 on July 8, 2025, Rio time)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BRICS leaders emphasize consolidating the partner framework and institutional cooperation at Rio, perhaps noting Saudi Arabia’s status and partner-country progress, but announce no new full-member invitations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ahead of or at Rio, BRICS unanimously invites at least one partner (e.g., Nigeria, Thailand, Malaysia, Belarus, Cuba, etc.) or another interested UN member to become a full member, with accession to be finalized later.",
    "rationale": "Expansion is a stated goal and the new partner-country framework provides an obvious pipeline. Momentum is non-trivial: after the 2023 wave, four invites became members on Jan 1, 2024, and Indonesia upgraded to full membership on Jan 6, 2025. Brazil (the 2025 host) has historically been sympathetic to Global South coordination, and China/Russia favor expansion. Any single invitation would suffice for a Yes.\n\nCountervailing forces are meaningful. New members require unanimity, and India has been the most cautious about rapid expansion and about picks seen as advancing China’s influence. After a large 2023 expansion and Indonesia’s 2025 accession, a short pause to consolidate is plausible. Politically sensitive candidates (e.g., Belarus) could face resistance from some members and from Brazil’s balancing instincts. The research assistant notes limited buy-in signals: Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam haven’t confirmed partner participation; Kazakhstan explicitly ruled out seeking full membership on May 30, 2025, narrowing the near-term pool. Also, with Saudi Arabia’s status unresolved, members may prefer to avoid further complicating the bloc’s composition before Rio.\n\nWhy not higher: no strong public pre-summit smoke signals of additional invitations, unanimity constraints, and recent rapid enlargement suggest a consolidation phase. Why not lower: expansion remains an explicit agenda item; the partner pipeline offers ready candidates; a single invitation is politically cheaper than a large tranche and could serve the host’s desire for a headline.\n\nWhat would move me up: credible leaks from BRICS Sherpas/foreign ministers indicating consensus on a specific candidate; public applications plus endorsements by Brazil/India; pre-summit communiqués flagging a decision on new full members. What would move me down: public statements from India or Brazil signaling no 2025 enlargement; signs of intra-BRICS friction over expansion criteria; agenda previews focusing exclusively on partners/institutional reforms without membership decisions.\n\nResearch assistant inputs incorporated: partner framework and list from the 16th summit; Indonesia’s Jan 6, 2025 accession; Algeria/Turkey/Vietnam not confirming partner status; Kazakhstan’s May 30, 2025 decision against full membership.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a new country be invited to BRICS at the 17th BRICS Summit?\n\nQuestion background:\n[BRICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS) is an intergovernmental organization originally founded by Brazil, Russia, India, and China, which held their first formal summit in 2009. South Africa was invited to join in 2010, completing the original five-member grouping. BRICS serves as a forum for cooperation among major emerging economies, with a focus on economic development, political coordination, and reform of international institutions.\n\nAt the [15th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_BRICS_summit) in August 2023, the group announced a major expansion. Full membership invitations were extended to Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Argentina later declined the invitation, while Saudi Arabia has not formally accepted. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, and the UAE officially joined on January 1, 2024.&#x20;\n\nAt the [16th BRICS Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/16th_BRICS_summit) in October 2024, held in Kazan, Russia, BRICS formally introduced a new partner country framework. Thirteen countries were invited as partners at the 16th Summit: Algeria, Belarus, Bolivia, Cuba, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Turkey, Thailand, Uganda, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed participation. Indonesia later joined as a full member on January 6, 2025.\n\nThe 17th BRICS Summit is scheduled to take place on July 6–7, 2025, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Many countries have formally expressed interest in joining BRICS, but new members can only be admitted with unanimous agreement from existing members. While expansion remains a stated goal of the bloc, no new invitations have been confirmed.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if at least one previously not invited country is invited to join BRICS as a full member during or before the 17th BRICS summit.\n\nThis question will only resolve based upon an invitation for full membership, not partner status or any other status in the organisation.\n\n* An invitation of a partner country to become a full member will resolve this question as **Yes**.\n* Reinvitation of Saudi Arabia or Argentina will not be sufficient to resolve this question as **Yes**.&#x20;\n* Whether or not a country accepts its invitation will have no impact on this question.\n* If the 17th BRICS summit is delayed, that will not impact this question unless the delay is to after August 31, 2025, in which case this question will be annulled.\n* The specific cutoff for resolution will be 00:00 following the final day of the summit. For example, if the summit is held as expected on July 6-7, the cutoff will be July 8, 00:00. This question will use the timezone of the summit's location, if the summit has no physical location, it will use UTC.\n* For the purposes of this question, \"country\" is defined as a UN member state.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAt the 16th BRICS Summit, a 'partner country' framework was introduced. Of the initial invitees, Indonesia has since become a full member. Algeria, Turkey, and Vietnam have not yet confirmed their participation in the partner framework. On May 30, 2025, Kazakhstan's President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev publicly ruled out seeking full membership, stating that his country would maintain its observer status.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
