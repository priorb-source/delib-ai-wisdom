    "review": "The other forecasters make compelling arguments that I should weigh more carefully. All three of us converged on similar reasoning about the extremely short timeframe and lack of specific crisis indicators, but they landed at 7-8% while I forecasted 12%. Their explicit mention of base rates for public company bankruptcies is particularly important - among all struggling publicly traded firms, the fraction that actually file bankruptcy within 2 months is indeed very low. They also correctly emphasize that even severe business model disruption typically unfolds over quarters, not weeks. Their consensus around 7-8% suggests I may be overweighting general uncertainty. However, I note that none of us have access to Chegg's current cash position, debt maturity schedule, or recent financial statements. The WSJ article headline 'brought down' could be journalistic hyperbole, but it could also signal more acute problems than typical competitive pressure. The absence of evidence for imminent crisis is meaningful, but it's not the same as evidence of absence - we simply lack current data rather than having reassuring data.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast downward but not fully to their range. Their arguments about base rates and typical bankruptcy timelines are well-founded and I should weight these more heavily. The strong consensus at 7-8% indicates my 12% was likely too high. However, I maintain a slightly higher forecast than theirs (10% vs 7-8%) because: (1) we genuinely lack current financial information about Chegg, creating meaningful uncertainty, (2) while 57 days is very short, it's sufficient if a company is already in acute distress, and (3) the WSJ article, even if somewhat hyperbolic, suggests material impact. The difference between 8% and 10% reflects my view that the information vacuum warrants a modest additional uncertainty premium, but I acknowledge their base rate and timeline arguments significantly constrain the probability space.",
