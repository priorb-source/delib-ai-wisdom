  "information": "According to its latest financial reports, AquaBounty Technologies' cash reserves declined from $9.2 million at the end of 2023 to $230,000 as of December 31, 2024. The company reported a GAAP EPS of -$29.47 and revenue of $0.79 million for the fiscal year, a 68% year-over-year decrease. The company's former CFO stated, \"We do not have sufficient liquidity to continue operations,\" and management has issued a going-concern warning. The company's reported debt-to-equity ratio is 0.05.\n\nIn December 2024, AquaBounty announced it was ceasing fish farming activities, shutting down its last operational facility, and culling its remaining fish stock. The company laid off \"substantially all\" of its staff at the site. With production halted, there is no operating cash inflow. Management has acknowledged that its capital-raising efforts have been unsuccessful for over a year and has stated it is \"assessing alternatives\" for its Ohio facility.\n\nBy March 2025, AquaBounty's market capitalization had fallen to approximately $2.2 million, with its stock price dropping from a 52-week high of $3.05 to well below $1. The stock is trading below the NASDAQ compliance threshold, risking delisting. Despite the low price, institutional investor Epiq Partners LLC increased its holdings in the company by 423.5% in the fourth quarter. As of early 2025, institutional investors and hedge funds own 8.92% of the company's stock.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 8 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No filing by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The company continues an out-of-court wind-down: cuts to a bare-bones team, delays or stretches payables, seeks to sell the Ohio facility or other assets, possibly receives a small bridge/insider infusion or executes a modest equity raise, and accepts delisting if it happens. They may pursue an asset sale or plan of dissolution without a bankruptcy filing before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Liquidity fully exhausts and creditor pressure or board fiduciary concerns trigger a voluntary Chapter 7 (liquidation) or Chapter 11 filing in May/June—potentially around the Q1 10-Q deadline if they cannot fund ongoing audit and public-company costs or face defaults/claims they cannot manage out of court.",
    "rationale": "Evidence pointing to elevated bankruptcy risk: Cash fell from $9.2m (end 2023) to $0.23m (12/31/24); operations have ceased with the last site shut and fish culled; management issued a going-concern warning and has stated liquidity is insufficient to continue operations; capital-raising efforts have been unsuccessful for over a year; market cap ~ $2.2m and risk of Nasdaq delisting. These factors increase the chance of a near-term Chapter 7/11 filing.\n\nCountervailing factors tempering the probability within the short horizon: The reported debt-to-equity ratio of 0.05 suggests limited financial debt and potentially less immediate creditor pressure. With operations halted and staff reduced, cash burn may be lower than historical levels, enabling the company to limp along for some weeks while seeking an asset sale (e.g., Ohio facility) or other strategic alternative. Public micro-caps in distress often delay bankruptcy, sometimes opting for out-of-court wind-downs, assignments for the benefit of creditors, or eventual dissolution rather than filing quickly. Delisting risk by itself does not force bankruptcy.\n\nStatus quo weighting: As of today (May 5, 2025), no petition has been filed. With only ~8 weeks left, inertia plus the ability to stretch payables and run a minimal-cost shell make “No filing before July 1” the base case, albeit with substantial risk.\n\nWhy not higher: Low financial leverage reduces forced timelines; out-of-court paths exist; short remaining window; a single small financing or asset-sale LOI could push any filing past July 1.\n\nWhy not lower: Liquidity appears critically low with no operating inflows; former CFO’s statement and going-concern disclosure signal acute distress; inability to raise capital for over a year; upcoming reporting and compliance costs could be near-term catalysts for a filing.\n\nWhat would move me up: 8-Ks or disclosures of payment defaults, secured creditor actions or liens accelerating, auditor resignation or inability to file the 10-Q on time due to funding constraints, failed attempts to sell assets, or layoffs/board changes indicating imminent liquidation.\n\nWhat would move me down: Announced binding asset sale or financing that extends runway beyond July, a clear out-of-court dissolution plan with sufficient liquidity to execute, or confirmation of minimal liabilities that can be managed without court protection through the summer.\n\nSummary of assistant’s report impacting the forecast: Severe cash depletion; ceased operations and layoffs; going-concern warning; failed capital raises; large revenue decline; tiny market cap and delisting risk; low debt load; a notable but small increase in holdings by one investor. These point to high distress but not an inevitable, immediate bankruptcy in the next eight weeks.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
