    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two months, as a successful coup must occur before July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No successful coup occurs in Africa or Latin America within the specified timeframe. Political stability, however tenuous, is maintained in the most at-risk nations, and the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Political tensions and security crises persist in several countries, particularly in Africa's Sahel region (e.g., Chad, Sudan) and volatile parts of Latin America (e.g., Haiti). However, these issues do not culminate in an overt, illegal seizure of power by the military or other state elites. Any coup attempts that do materialize are disorganized and quickly suppressed by loyalist factions, failing to meet the criteria for 'successful'.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In an African nation experiencing a protracted security and political crisis, a faction of the military deposes the ruling executive. For example, in a country like Chad or Sudan, a senior general, citing the government's failure to contain insurgency and ensure stability, seizes the presidential palace and state media. The military high command coalesces behind the new leader, and after a few days of uncertainty, resistance ceases, establishing a new de facto government.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 20% is based on a balance between the high frequency of recent coups and the very short time window for this question. The core of my analysis relies on the base rate of successful coups. The provided data indicates a cluster of at least seven successful coups in Africa between August 2020 and August 2023. This created a 'coup spike', especially in the Sahel. However, there has been a notable lull in successful coups in the roughly 20 months since August 2023. By calculating a base rate over the entire period (August 2020 to April 2025), we get a probability of a coup occurring in a two-month window of approximately 24%. I have adjusted this slightly downward to 20% to place more weight on the recent quiet period and the strong general tendency toward the status quo over short timeframes. The large geographical scope of the question (over 70 countries in Africa and Latin America) prevents the probability from being lower. The underlying drivers for instability—poor governance, economic distress, and security crises—persist, particularly in the Sahel 'coup belt'. Latin America contributes less to the overall probability, as recent attempts there (Peru, Brazil, Bolivia) have failed, indicating stronger institutional resilience compared to the most fragile African states. My forecast is not higher because the 20-month lull since the last successful coup is significant evidence that the 2020-2023 spike may not represent the current norm. Furthermore, the high threshold for a 'successful' coup filters out more common failed attempts. My forecast is not lower because the fundamental causes of instability remain potent across numerous countries, and a coup can be a sudden, unpredictable event. I would increase my forecast upon credible reports of a near-miss coup attempt or significant, public dissent from military leadership in a high-risk nation. I would decrease it if there were successful, high-profile diplomatic interventions by regional bodies that de-escalated a brewing crisis.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to [Powell & Thyne (2011, p. 252)](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf), a coup is \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\" In recent years, some of the coups in Africa have been:&#x20;\n\n* [Mali August 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Mali May 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Niger March 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Nigerien_coup_attempt) (attempt)\n* [Niger July 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nigerien_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Gabon August 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Gabonese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Chad January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%27Djamena_attack) (possible attempt)\n* [Burkina Faso January 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Burkina Faso September 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)&#x20;\n* [Guinea September 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n\nLatin America has had the following coup attempts in recent years:\n\n* [Peru self-coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Peruvian_self-coup_attempt), December 2022\n* [Brazil Congress attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack), January 2023\n* [Bolivia coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bolivian_coup_attempt), June 2024\n\nSee also: [VoA by the numbers Coups in Africa](https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is a successful coup d’état in any country on the African continent or Latin America before July 1, 2025, according to credible media reports. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nLatin America is defined as any country in North America or South America whose primary language is Spanish, Portuguese or French.\n\nA coup d’état (often shortened to \"coup\") is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) as an event in which a state's military or other components of its power structure overthrow the existing political authority.&#x20;\n\nA \"successful\" coup is defined as a coup in which the group or person attempting to seize power establishes control over both the government and military, and will be considered to have succeeded once any significant resistance to their authority has ceased.&#x20;\n\nA self-coup, [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup) as a political leader, having come to power through legal means, remaining in power through illegal means, will count. This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-25.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
