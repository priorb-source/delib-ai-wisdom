  "information": "Data from the Crowd Counting Consortium from early 2025 showed a notable trend in protest activity. The consortium recorded 2,085 protests nationwide in February 2025, more than double the 937 recorded in February 2017. However, the data also indicated that the average size of these events had decreased to an estimated 60-88 participants per protest. In separate protest movements, over 300 actions were reported on university campuses related to the conflict in Israel.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the question criteria have not yet been satisfied and current data suggests protests are occurring frequently but at smaller sizes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Protests continue at high frequency but remain relatively small-scale, with typical gatherings averaging 60-88 participants. No major triggering event occurs that mobilizes 10,000+ people in a single location, or any large protests that do occur are not captured by the Global Protest Tracker specifically.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant triggering event occurs in the next two months - such as a controversial Supreme Court decision, major legislative action, police incident, or international crisis - that mobilizes 10,000+ participants in a single protest location. The Global Protest Tracker identifies and reports this event with participant counts meeting the threshold.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's data presents a mixed picture. While protest activity is notably high (2,085 protests in February 2025, more than double February 2017), the average protest size has decreased significantly to 60-88 participants. This suggests a trend toward more frequent but smaller, distributed actions rather than mass mobilizations. With approximately 2 months remaining, the status quo would continue this trend toward a No outcome. However, several factors create meaningful probability for Yes: (1) Two months provides sufficient time for a triggering event and mobilization; (2) The US has demonstrated capacity for large-scale protests historically when catalyzing events occur; (3) We're entering summer months when outdoor gatherings are more feasible; (4) The current political environment remains polarized and active. The forecast is not higher because the data shows clear evidence that protest patterns have shifted toward smaller events, and we're already well into 2025 without a reported 10,000+ participant protest. Additionally, there's uncertainty about whether the Global Protest Tracker would capture such an event even if it occurred, as their reporting may have selection criteria or delays. The forecast is not lower because two months represents meaningful time for political, social, or legal developments to trigger mass mobilization, and historical precedent shows the US can generate very large protests when conditions align. I would update higher if: polling showed intense public sentiment on an upcoming decision/event, organizing for a major march was announced, or similar large protests occurred in other countries signaling a global movement. I would update lower if: the next month passed without any protests exceeding 1,000 participants or no major triggering events materialized.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in the United States with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBrookings Institution: [The power of protest in the US](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-power-of-protest-in-the-us/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in the United States with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nData from the Crowd Counting Consortium from early 2025 showed a notable trend in protest activity.

However, the data also indicated that the average size of these events had decreased to an estimated 60-88 participants per protest.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
