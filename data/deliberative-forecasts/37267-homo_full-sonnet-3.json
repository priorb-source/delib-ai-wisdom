    "review": "The striking convergence at 10% across all three forecasts is notable and reinforces confidence in this estimate. All analyses identified similar key factors: (1) base rates suggesting 1-2.7% probability over 2 months; (2) the April 30 review maintained Level 3 despite known regional conflicts; (3) Ethiopia's trajectory improved from Level 4 to Level 3 in early 2023; (4) May 1 sanctions signal concern but represent a measured response, not an acute crisis requiring immediate advisory changes; (5) absence of typical upgrade catalysts (coups, embassy evacuations, attacks on foreigners, airport closures). Forecaster 3's point about the 2-month timeframe being 'short for such a significant policy change absent a major catalyst' is particularly strong - major State Department policy shifts typically require either acute crises or sustained deterioration over longer periods. The fact that violence remains regionalized with existing Level 4 warnings for specific areas suggests the State Department views the situation as compartmentalized rather than nationally threatening. The May 1 sanctions, while concerning, appear to be a diplomatic tool rather than a precursor to travel advisory escalation. No forecaster presented evidence or arguments that would warrant changing my assessment.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find strong convergence on both reasoning and probability estimate. All three analyses correctly identified: (1) very low base rates (1-2.7% over 2 months); (2) recent State Department review maintaining Level 3; (3) improving trajectory since 2023 downgrade; (4) May 1 sanctions as measured concern rather than crisis indicator; (5) absence of typical upgrade catalysts. The emphasis on the short 2-month timeframe and the 'measured response' interpretation of sanctions strengthens the case for staying at 10% rather than going higher. The violence remaining regionalized with existing Level 4 designations for specific areas suggests the State Department has already calibrated its response appropriately. For the probability to increase meaningfully, we would need to see: violence spreading to Addis Ababa or major cities, incidents involving US citizens, embassy staff evacuations, airport closures, or coup attempts. None of these appear imminent. The convergence at 10% across independent analyses using similar evidence and reasoning suggests this is a well-calibrated estimate that appropriately balances the low base rate with elevated but not acute risk factors. I maintain my forecast at 10%.",
