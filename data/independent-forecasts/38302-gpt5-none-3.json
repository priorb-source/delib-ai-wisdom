    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~10–14 days (NBS May CPI typically releases around June 12; FRED usually updates within a few days after)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — another negative y/y CPI print (deflation persists)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May CPI y/y is 0.0% or positive, helped by strong May Day holiday services prices, firmer energy, and a smaller drag from food; base effects versus May 2024 prevent a negative print.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "May CPI y/y remains below 0 as food (especially pork) stays weak, core goods remain soft amid property/overcapacity pressures, and holiday-driven services inflation is not strong enough to offset the drags.",
    "rationale": "Evidence points to three consecutive negative y/y prints into April, and press reports flagged April deflation, suggesting momentum is still weak. With PPI likely still negative and domestic demand soft, the status quo favors continued mild CPI deflation. That said, May has countervailing supports: the Golden Week travel surge can lift services prices, energy prices were not especially weak, and base effects versus May 2024 may be less conducive to a negative print. Netting these, I expect a close call around zero with a tilt toward another negative. I give extra weight to the status quo (deflation persisting) but keep the probability modest because a small positive (+0.1) is plausible and the resolution hinges on the FRED series, where rounding near 0.0 matters. Research assistant provided no additional info, so this relies on recent trend, typical release timing, and known seasonal dynamics. I would raise the probability if high-frequency food (pork/veg) or MOFCOM price trackers for May show continued broad declines and if May Day services inflation looked muted; I would lower it if reports show strong services price gains, notable fuel price pass-through, or signs that food deflation eased materially. Also, any indication that NBS’s May CPI consensus has turned positive would lower the odds.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill China experience a 4th month in a row of deflation in its May CPI report?\n\nQuestion background:\nSCMP: [China’s consumer prices fall in April, fuelling fears of deflation](https://www.scmp.com/economy/economic-indicators/article/3309834/chinas-consumer-prices-fall-april-fuelling-fears-deflation)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the \"Percent Change from Year Ago, Not Seasonally Adjusted\" data presented at [FRED Consumer Price Indices (CPIs, HICPs), COICOP 1999: Consumer Price Index: Total for China (CHNCPIALLMINMEI)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CHNCPIALLMINMEI#) is negative for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
