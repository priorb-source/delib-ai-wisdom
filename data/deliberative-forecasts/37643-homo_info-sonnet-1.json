    "review": "Both forecasters raise critical information I had not fully considered. Forecaster 2's mention of the Negotiated Rulemaking Committee with its first session on June 30 and rules expected 'later in 2025' is particularly significant - this timeline explicitly extends beyond our July 1 deadline. Even more important is their observation that the committee's stated purpose is 'refining the definition' rather than terminating the program, suggesting modification rather than elimination. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the statutory basis of PSLF (20 U.S.C. §1087e(m)) is also crucial - executive orders can restrict eligibility but cannot fully terminate a program established by federal statute without Congressional action. Both forecasters make compelling cases that the tracker likely requires formal, substantive termination rather than just proposals or partial restrictions. The fact that the objective has remained 'in progress' for over 2 months despite significant executive action supports this interpretation. Their lower forecasts of 8% and 10% appear better calibrated to the evidence than my original 25%.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I was too optimistic about the possibility of completion by July 1. The combination of: (1) the Negotiated Rulemaking Committee timeline explicitly extending past the deadline with its first session June 30, (2) the statutory nature of PSLF requiring Congressional legislation for true termination, (3) the focus on 'refining' eligibility criteria rather than terminating the program, (4) the tracker's apparent high bar for 'complete' status after 2+ months at 'in progress', and (5) only 48 days remaining, all strongly suggest this will not be marked complete by July 1. However, I'm not going quite as low as 8% because there remains some irreducible uncertainty about: how the tracker maintainers define 'termination' (they might mark aggressive restrictions as 'complete'), the small possibility of dramatic unilateral executive action that halts all PSLF operations regardless of legal validity, and the inherent unpredictability in rapidly changing political situations. I'm updating downward significantly but maintaining a probability slightly above the other forecasters to account for tail-risk scenarios.",
