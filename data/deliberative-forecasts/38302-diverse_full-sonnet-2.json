    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I converged on very similar reasoning and probabilities (75% vs my 72%), both emphasizing the strong deflationary trend while acknowledging the April reading was only -0.1%. Forecaster 3's lower 60% forecast raises important points I underweighted: (1) The May Day holiday effect on services prices - a concrete, identifiable factor specific to May that could provide a temporary boost. This is a legitimate consideration I hadn't explicitly addressed. (2) The proximity to zero means small positive surprises in volatile components could flip the sign. (3) Oil's 4% YoY rise providing gradual upward pressure. However, Forecaster 3 may be overweighting these factors relative to the entrenched structural deflation. The May Day holiday boost would need to overcome persistent weakness in goods prices, depressed pork prices, negative domestic energy prices, and the fact that PPI deflation is accelerating (-2.7%, worst in 6 months) not improving. All three of us acknowledge the weak underlying demand environment - manufacturing PMI contractionary, property declining, core CPI subdued - which creates strong headwinds against any return to positive inflation.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I'm adjusting my forecast down from 72% to 68%. The key factors driving this modest revision are: (1) The May Day holiday effect on services prices is a specific, concrete factor for May 2025 that I hadn't adequately considered. While overall demand is weak, the holiday could provide a temporary boost. (2) At -0.1% in April, we're extremely close to zero, making the outcome more sensitive to small fluctuations in volatile components like fresh food or gasoline. (3) Oil's 4% YoY increase could provide some gradual upward pressure even if not fully transmitted. However, I'm not moving all the way to 60% because the underlying deflationary forces remain dominant: PPI deflation is accelerating not decelerating, manufacturing continues contracting, property weakness persists, pork and energy prices remain depressed, and core CPI is very subdued. The three-month established trend of deflation, combined with worsening producer prices and weak activity indicators, suggests structural disinflationary forces that a single holiday and modest oil price increases are unlikely to fully offset. My 68% forecast reflects high confidence in continued deflation while acknowledging meaningful uncertainty at the margin.",
