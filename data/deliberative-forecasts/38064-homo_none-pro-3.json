    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental dynamics of this question. We all identify the high base rate of corporate meetings occurring as scheduled, note the specific, significant risk demonstrated by the 2024 server crash, and agree that the company has a powerful incentive to prevent a recurrence. Forecaster 3's analysis aligns almost perfectly with my initial reasoning, providing confidence in the original framework. Forecaster 2's analysis, however, introduced a nuance that I find persuasive. They framed the 2024 failure not just as a risk factor, but as an event that makes a 2025 failure *less* likely due to the corrective actions it would trigger. This 'learning from failure' effect is a strong argument. They also astutely highlighted the strictness of the resolution criteria, where any postponement for any reason resolves the question to 'No', which is a solid justification for capping the probability below ~95%. Their reasoning has convinced me that I may have slightly underestimated the company's motivation and ability to solve a known, albeit challenging, technical problem.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am updating my probability upward. My initial reasoning remains the same: the base rate for this event is very high, but the specific precedent of the 2024 server failure introduces a significant and quantifiable risk. However, I was persuaded by Forecaster 2's argument that the 2024 failure is a powerful forcing function that makes a repeat less, not more, likely. The reputational damage and shareholder relations fallout from a second consecutive failure would be immense, and management has had a full year and ample resources to contract with a vendor capable of handling extreme load. The problem is technical, not existential, and therefore solvable with sufficient planning and resources. I am increasing my forecast from 85% to 88%. This small but meaningful adjustment reflects an increased confidence in the company's ability to learn from its high-profile mistake. I am not moving higher, to 90% or above, because I am also weighing Forecaster 2's point about the strict resolution criteria. Even a brief, temporary technical issue that causes a postponement would resolve this question as 'No', and that small but non-zero risk of a minor glitch prevents me from being more confident.",
