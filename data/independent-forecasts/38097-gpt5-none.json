    "no_outcome_scenario": "Disputes over eligibility continue but formal decisions are deferred to later stages (e.g., candidate validation in late summer). None of the five named figures is officially struck from the electoral roll or declared legally ineligible by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A credible outlet (e.g., CEI announcement, Constitutional Council ruling, court decision, or major wire service reports) confirms that at least one of: Laurent Gbagbo, Simone Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N’Guessan, Jean‑Louis Billon, or Gnangbo Kacou has been removed from the electoral list or otherwise legally barred from running before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: As of today, there is no confirmed disqualification of the listed candidates. With only about a month left, inertia favors no new formal action before July 1.\n- Elevating factors: Côte d’Ivoire has a recent history of using legal/administrative measures around the electoral roll and civic rights. The BBC piece noting a main opposition leader being removed from the electoral list (even if not one of the five named) signals a live, restrictive environment and ongoing revisions that could spill over to other opposition figures. Among the five, Laurent Gbagbo (due to past convictions and prior roll exclusions) and Simone Gbagbo (past legal issues despite amnesty) appear most exposed to administrative/legal exclusions. This makes a pre–July 1 disqualification plausible.\n- Dampening factors: Formal presidential candidacy validation typically occurs closer to the election; authorities may time sensitive disqualifications nearer that window. Also, even in contentious environments, administrative processes can be slow and legally contested, pushing any definitive exclusion past July 1.\n- Why not higher: Short timeline (≈1 month) and the tendency for formal candidate vetting to happen later reduce odds of a definitive pre–July 1 action.\n- Why not lower: The active tightening around the electoral list and the specific vulnerability of at least one named figure (Laurent Gbagbo) keep the risk meaningfully above a low single-digit chance.\n- What would move me up: An official CEI update excluding any of the five from the roll; a court/Constitutional Council decision affirming the loss of civic rights for any of them; credible reports that prior convictions continue to bar roll inclusion.\n- What would move me down: Credible reports that the five are confirmed on the updated electoral list; legal rehabilitation or explicit restoration of civil rights; public assurances from authorities postponing eligibility decisions until after July 1.\n- Research assistant: No additional information provided; thus I rely on recent patterns in Ivorian electoral administration and known legal exposure of the named figures.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these candidates be disqualified from running in the 2025 Ivorian presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBBC: [Main opposition leader removed from Ivory Coast electoral list](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l0j849143o)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) any of these candidates has been removed from the electoral list or otherwise become legally ineligible to run in the [2025 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Ivorian_presidential_election) of the Ivory Coast (Côte d'Ivoire) under the laws of the country: Gnangbo Kacou, Laurent Gbagbo, Pascal Affi N'Guessan, Jean-Louis Billon, or Simone Gbagbo.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
