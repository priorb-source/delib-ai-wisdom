  "information": "On March 13, 2025, the government of Chad officially granted Starlink an operating license. The stated goal is to enhance internet connectivity, particularly in remote areas where the existing 6,000 km of fiber optic infrastructure is insufficient, and to support educational and healthcare institutions. Government officials have stated that negotiations were conducted to ensure affordable pricing for the service.\n\nThe time between Starlink receiving a license and its service becoming 'Available' on its map varies in other African nations. For the Democratic Republic of Congo, the process took approximately 10 weeks in 2025. For Malawi and Zambia, it was about 16 weeks, and for Benin, it was 24 weeks. Niger's service was officially launched on March 13, 2025, the same day Chad's license was announced. In May 2025, a pan-African partnership between SpaceX and Airtel was announced to potentially accelerate kit distribution.\n\nStarlink's expansion faces both technical advantages and logistical challenges. The use of optical inter-satellite links reduces the need for local ground stations in every country. However, high demand has led to service pauses and waiting lists in other regions, including some African countries like Nigeria and Kenya. For Chad specifically, potential obstacles include its landlocked geography, limited retail infrastructure, and the need to finalize details such as import rules and spectrum fees.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the map remains without any Chad cells marked “Available” by July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Post-license implementation drags: import/type-approval and spectrum/fee details take longer, retail/distribution isn’t ready, and Starlink keeps Chad as “Coming Soon” or unlisted on the availability map until mid/late July or later.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Starlink finalizes pricing/import details quickly, leverages crosslinks (no immediate need for a local gateway), and, with Airtel’s help, opens at least one cell (e.g., N’Djamena area) for orders; the map flips to “Available” for some part of Chad before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Key facts from the assistant’s report: (1) Chad’s operating license was officially granted on March 13, 2025. (2) Recent African timelines from license to “Available” on the map vary: DRC ~10 weeks (fast), Malawi/Zambia ~16 weeks, Benin ~24 weeks. (3) A SpaceX–Airtel pan-African partnership (May 2025) could accelerate kit distribution. (4) Potential obstacles in Chad include landlocked logistics, limited retail infrastructure, and finalizing import/spectrum/pricing details. Today is May 15, 2025, i.e., ~9 weeks post-license. The cutoff (July 1) is ~15.6 weeks post-license. That means Chad would need to match the faster end of observed timelines (≤~15–16 weeks) to resolve Yes. Among the cited examples, only DRC (10 weeks) clearly fits within that window; Malawi/Zambia at ~16 weeks land slightly after the cutoff; Benin at 24 weeks is well beyond. That skew favors No as the status quo outcome. Why not higher? As of 9 weeks, there’s no indication the map has flipped, suggesting Chad is not on an ultra-fast track. Many countries cluster around or beyond ~16 weeks; small logistical and regulatory delays could easily push activation past July 1. Why not lower? Technical readiness via inter-satellite links reduces dependence on local gateways; Chad’s relatively low density may ease capacity constraints; and the Airtel partnership could shorten distribution and go-to-market steps. A limited-area activation (even a single cell) is sufficient for a Yes, and Starlink sometimes batches map updates late in a quarter. What would move my forecast up: credible indications that Starlink has finalized local pricing/import rules, acceptance of preorders in Chad, Airtel/Chadian government announcement of a June launch, or the map showing “Q2 2025” timing for Chad. What would move it down: signals of deferred timelines (e.g., “Q3 2025” or later), continued lack of preorder/retail signals into early June, or reports of customs/type-approval holdups. Overall, weighing the status quo inertia and observed timelines against the possibility of a late-Q2 push, I assign a modest chance that at least some part of Chad appears as “Available” by July 1.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
