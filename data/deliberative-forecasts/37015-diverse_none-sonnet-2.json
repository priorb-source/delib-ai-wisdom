    "review": "Forecaster 3 raised a crucial historical precedent I had overlooked: Acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn declined to run in the 2017 snap election, citing the need for neutrality and governance continuity. This establishes a meaningful norm that weighs against Han declaring candidacy. The point about Han's technocratic rather than campaign-oriented profile is also well-taken. Forecaster 2 makes a compelling argument that the snap election crisis context serves as a powerful catalyst that can override normal political calendars - I may have underweighted this factor. However, I remain skeptical that 25% is justified given the combination of: (1) the newly-cited precedent, (2) Han's profile, (3) only 13 days remaining, and (4) no concrete signals of imminent announcement beyond 'growing support.' The fact that all three of us independently arrived at similar probability ranges (15-25%) suggests reasonable convergence on the key considerations.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I underweighted the snap election context as a catalyst for accelerated decision-making. Forecaster 2 correctly notes that crisis situations compress political timelines and can force rapid decisions. However, Forecaster 3's historical precedent of Hwang Kyo-ahn declining in 2017 is important evidence that acting presidents face real constraints - both normative and practical - against campaigning. This precedent was not present in my initial analysis and strengthens the case for No. Balancing these considerations: the 2017 precedent suggests institutional reluctance, Han's technocratic profile reduces likelihood of a quick campaign pivot, but the genuine draft movement and compressed June election timeline create a narrow but real window. The status quo bias remains strong with only 13 days left and no concrete announcement signals. I'm updating slightly upward from 15% to acknowledge the crisis catalyst argument more fully, while still heavily weighting the precedent and status quo.",
