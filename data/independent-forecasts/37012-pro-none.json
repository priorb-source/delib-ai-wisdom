    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two weeks. The election is on May 1, 2025, and results are expected within a day or two.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The Conservative Party won a commanding majority in the inaugural 2021 election, securing 66 of the 93 seats.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A massive national swing towards the Labour Party translates into unprecedented local gains. Labour, and to a lesser extent the Liberal Democrats, pick up over two dozen seats directly from the Conservatives, driven by dissatisfaction with the national government and the local council's performance. Labour emerges as the largest party, even if short of an overall majority.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Conservatives suffer significant losses due to a challenging national political environment, but their large 2021 majority provides a sufficient cushion. They may lose their overall majority but still retain a plurality of seats, finishing ahead of a resurgent Labour party. For instance, they could drop from 66 to 45 seats and still be the largest party.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the large incumbent majority held by the Conservative Party. Following the 2021 election, they controlled 66 of the 93 seats, a dominant position that is difficult to overturn in a single electoral cycle. This existing seat distribution serves as a powerful anchor and a substantial buffer against losses.\n\nHowever, the national political context is highly unfavorable for the Conservative Party. National polling over the past 18 months has consistently shown a large lead for Labour. Local election results are often heavily influenced by national sentiment, suggesting the Conservatives will almost certainly lose a significant number of seats compared to their 2021 high-water mark. \n\nThe central question is whether the expected swing against them will be large enough to remove their status as the largest party. For Labour (currently on 21 seats) to overtake the Conservatives (on 66), it would require a swing of historic proportions, with the crossover point being around 43 seats for each party. This would necessitate the Conservatives losing, and Labour winning, over 20 seats. While not impossible, such a dramatic shift is a low-probability event, even in a difficult political year. West Northamptonshire also contains areas that are traditionally strong Conservative heartlands, providing a relatively solid vote floor.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 80% because a wave of anti-incumbent sentiment, driven by national politics, could produce a surprisingly large electoral swing, leading to a Labour plurality. The volatility of local elections and the potential for tactical voting cannot be entirely discounted.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 80% because the sheer scale of the 2021 Conservative majority makes it the most likely outcome that they will remain the largest party, even if they suffer heavy losses and lose overall control. Status quo in terms of party control, even with reduced numbers, is a powerful force. I would update my forecast downwards if credible local polling emerged showing a catastrophic collapse in the Conservative vote. Conversely, a significant recovery in the national polls for the Conservatives would cause me to update my forecast upwards.",
