  "information": "Discord had previously considered going public in 2021 but postponed those plans due to market volatility. That same year, Microsoft offered to acquire Discord for $10 billion, but the company's leadership rejected the offer and a potential IPO was considered as an alternative. Responding to the recent 2025 IPO reports, a Discord spokesperson stated that the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. Discord's revenue is generated through a 'freemium' model, selling subscriptions for premium features.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discord continues prepping privately and either files a confidential S-1 (which wouldn’t count) or waits to publicly file until July/August or later; no specific IPO announcement appears on Discord’s news/blog before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Discord publicly files an S-1 in June 2025 (or posts a specific, unambiguous announcement on its news/blog that it is planning an IPO, e.g., “We have filed a Form S-1”).",
    "rationale": "- Setup: The question resolves Yes only if Discord publicly files an S-1 or makes a specific IPO announcement on its official news/blog before July 1. In practice, companies rarely announce plans before a public filing due to gun-jumping concerns, so the dominant path to Yes is a public S-1.  - Evidence: Reporting (e.g., Ars/The Information) says Discord is targeting a 2025 IPO and has selected JPMorgan and Goldman as lead underwriters—credible steps toward going public. A spokesperson declined to comment, which is standard. No public S-1 yet.  - Timing dynamics: From banker selection (reported March 2025) to a public S-1, 2–4 months is plausible. If targeting a fall listing, Discord could either (a) publicly file in June to start the process and amend later, or (b) wait until late summer. Many high-profile issuers prefer to file closer to the roadshow to limit scrutiny, but others (e.g., Instacart in 2023) filed weeks to months ahead. The IPO window is reasonably open in 2025, which modestly supports a June filing.  - Status quo weighting: With ~5.5 weeks left and no public S-1, the default outcome is No. A large, widely watched filing would likely come with media signaling in the days prior; absent that (so far), odds remain below 50%.  - Why not higher: The window is short; the company can pursue a confidential submission or wait until after July 1 without consequence. Pre-filing blog announcements are unlikely. If aiming for a September/October listing, a July/August public S-1 is more typical than June.  - Why not lower: Credible reports of a 2025 IPO and named lead banks indicate momentum. Some issuers do publicly file months ahead to begin the SEC review, making a June S-1 plausible. Market conditions are supportive enough that Discord could choose to move now.  - Updaters: I would raise the probability upon (1) credible reports of a confidential S-1 already submitted or guidance that a public filing is imminent, (2) observable preparatory moves like adding independent directors/audit committee chair typical pre-IPO, or (3) media reports of a June roadshow timeline. I would lower it if (a) reports suggest a slip to late 2025/2026, (b) a large financing round replaces near-term IPO needs, (c) key executive turnover (e.g., CFO) or adverse market volatility emerges.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nDiscord had previously considered going public in 2021 but postponed those plans due to market volatility. That same year, Microsoft offered to acquire Discord for $10 billion, but the company's leadership rejected the offer and a potential IPO was considered as an alternative.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
