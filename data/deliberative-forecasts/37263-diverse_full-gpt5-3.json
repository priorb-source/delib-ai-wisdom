    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize strong base rates against a rapid Uber entry: tiny market size, short timeline, lack of any public signals, and an active regulatory posture focused on licensing and enforcement. They also note the presence of two local ride-hailing apps reducing marginal incentive for Uber. New angles I hadn’t explicitly considered: the possibility of a surprise acquisition of a local operator (Forecaster 2) and the explicit need for visible pre-launch signals in similar small-island contexts (Forecaster 3). I agree their emphasis on the absence of public evidence and the short runway is persuasive. The main counter I still see is an Uber Taxi-style launch with licensed drivers, which would be operationally lighter—but even that likely needs government/taxi-association buy-in, for which there are no signals. Their reasoning nudges me to weight the status quo more heavily.",
    "rationale": "I originally had 8%, leaving room for a quick ‘Uber Taxi’ partnership or a rapid licensing arrangement catalyzed by high tourism and the USD-based, English-speaking, mapping-friendly environment. After considering the other analyses, I’m marking down the tail: (1) the time window (~60 days) is very tight for regulatory alignment, driver onboarding, and a public launch; (2) recent government messaging prioritizes enforcement of licensing and does not hint at welcoming large international platforms; (3) base rates for Uber entering small Caribbean islands without prior signals are very low, and Uber’s recent moves favor larger markets or structured partnerships announced in advance; (4) the existence and recent launch of local apps suggests policymakers may prefer local solutions. I still keep a small tail for a fast ‘Uber Taxi’ integration or an acquisition/white-label of a local operator, but given no public breadcrumbs, I reduce my estimate. Updated from 8% to 5%.",
