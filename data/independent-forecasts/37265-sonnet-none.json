    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (60 days) until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Tanzania maintains its current travel advisory level (presumably Level 1 or Level 2) without upgrade to Level 3",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tanzania's security situation remains stable or improves through July 1, 2025. No major terrorist attacks, significant civil unrest, or dramatic escalation in crime against tourists occurs. The US State Department sees no compelling reason to elevate the travel advisory to Level 3, and Tanzania continues operating as a popular tourist destination for safaris and beach tourism.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant security event occurs in Tanzania before July 1, 2025 - such as a major terrorist attack targeting tourists or Westerners, substantial civil unrest or political violence, kidnapping of foreign nationals, or a dramatic spike in violent crime. This prompts the US State Department to reassess and upgrade Tanzania's travel advisory to Level 3 - Reconsider Travel within the next two months.",
    "rationale": "With only 60 days until the resolution date, the time window is quite short for a major policy change. Travel advisory upgrades to Level 3 are relatively uncommon and typically require substantial justification - either a major security incident or sustained deterioration in conditions. The question's phrasing implies Tanzania doesn't currently have Level 3 status. While the background article mentions crime and terrorism threats, many tourist destinations face similar challenges without receiving Level 3 advisories. The US State Department is generally cautious about upgrading advisories for popular tourist destinations without clear evidence of threat escalation. Good forecasting requires strong weighting toward status quo outcomes, as dramatic policy changes in short timeframes are rare. The research assistant provided no additional information suggesting imminent threats. For me to update higher, I would need: evidence of recent major security incidents in Tanzania, specific intelligence about imminent terrorist threats, signs of political instability, or patterns of escalating violence against foreigners. For me to update lower, I would need: confirmation of Tanzania's current stable Level 1 or 2 status, strong tourism security infrastructure, or positive security trends. The base rate for Level 3 upgrades in a 2-month window is quite low, but the possibility cannot be entirely dismissed given the unpredictable nature of security situations and the mentioned concerns about terrorism.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Tanzania receive a \"Level 3 – Reconsider Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Travel Advisory for Tanzania: How Increased Crime and Terrorism Threats Impact Tourists in Popular African Destinations](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/travel-advisory-for-tanzania-how-increased-crime-and-terrorism-threats-impact-tourists-in-popular-african-destinations/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Tanzania has received a Level 3 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Tanzania.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
