    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 23 days (until June 27, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the debt remains below $37T by June 27, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Normal fiscal operations continue with deficits and net issuance roughly tracking recent months (~$100–200B per month). By June 27, total public debt is around the high-$35T to roughly $36T range, short of $37T.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A rare, outsized surge of net Treasury issuance (on the order of $1T in a few weeks) due to an acute emergency or accounting reclassification pushes Total Public Debt Outstanding above $37T by June 27. This would likely require crisis-scale funding needs or an unusual one-off adjustment.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and trend: Debt growth is primarily driven by the federal deficit plus smaller adjustments. Recent annual deficits (~$1.6–1.8T) translate to an average monthly increase on the order of ~$130–150B, though month-to-month can vary. From early June to June 27 (~3 weeks), the typical increment is closer to ~$80–150B, far short of the ~$1T+ needed if the current level is in the mid-$35T to low-$36T range. \n- Proximity to the threshold: As of late spring 2025, Total Public Debt Outstanding has been in the mid-$35T to roughly $36T neighborhood by most plausible run-rate estimates (FY2024 ended near $34.7T; adding ~8–9 months of FY2025 deficit implies ~+$1.2–1.3T through late June, yielding roughly ~$36T). Hitting $37T by June 27 would require an unusually large, rapid jump. \n- Resolution mechanics: The Treasury’s Debt to the Penny reports daily values; June 27, 2025 is a business day, so a daily figure should exist. Even if it didn’t, the next date would be June 30; quarter-end adjustments can move figures but not by ~$1T within days under normal conditions. \n- Why not higher: Achieving ≥$37T by June 27 would require an unprecedented net issuance surge absent a debt-ceiling catch-up or crisis. Typical mid-year seasonality (post-April receipts) doesn’t produce trillion-dollar jumps in weeks. \n- Why not lower: A small tail risk remains for extraordinary events (financial crisis backstop, massive emergency supplemental with rapid cash build, or unusual accounting change) that could accelerate borrowing beyond the normal run-rate. \n- Evidence weighting: I put extra weight on the status quo trajectory—debt grows quickly but usually not by more than a few hundred billion per month. \n- Research assistant input: None provided; forecast relies on public deficit run-rates and standard Treasury issuance dynamics. \n- What would change my view upward: Credible reports of a sudden, very large emergency borrowing program, an announced rapid Treasury General Account rebuild of several hundred billion dollars in June, or an official accounting reclassification that adds close to $1T to Total Public Debt Outstanding immediately. \n- What would change my view downward: Confirmation that late-May/early-June debt levels are closer to ~$35.5T than ~$36T, or stronger-than-expected receipts reducing net issuance in June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US national debt be greater than $37 trillion on June 27, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBase rate information can be found at [Merchant Wholesalers, Except Manufacturers' Sales Branches and Offices: Durable Goods: Furniture and Home Furnishings Inventories/Sales Ratio](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/R4232IM163SCEN).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the value for Total Public Debt Outstanding at the Debt to the Penny chart at the US Treasury's [Debt to the Penny](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/debt-to-the-penny) tracker for June 27, 2025 is greater than or equal to $37,000,000,000,000.\n\nIf the resolution source does not report that specific date, then the resolution will be based on the amount corresponding with the first date after it.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
