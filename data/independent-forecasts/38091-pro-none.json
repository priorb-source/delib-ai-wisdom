    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "The outcome will be known on July 1, 2025, which is approximately one month from today's date of May 29, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo is the current list of 55 signatories. A new signature represents a change to this status quo, requiring specific diplomatic action and agreement to occur within the specified timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The month of June 2025 passes without any new country formally completing the process of signing the Artemis Accords. This could be due to diplomatic negotiations taking longer than anticipated, or simply due to the timing of ceremonies not falling within this specific 30-day window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A country's government, through its authorized representative, formally signs the Artemis Accords at a ceremony or diplomatic event between June 1, 2025, and June 30, 2025. The signing is publicly announced by the U.S. Department of State or another official source.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the recent rate of new signatories. In the first 4.5 months of 2025, at least eight countries have joined the Accords, including recent signatories Bangladesh (April) and Norway (May). This represents a significant acceleration compared to previous years, establishing a recent base rate of over one new signatory per month. Modeling this as a Poisson process suggests a high probability (over 75%) of at least one new signatory in a given month. This momentum reflects a concerted diplomatic effort by the United States and a growing international consensus on space exploration norms. My research assistant's report indicates no specific information, so this forecast relies on the statistical trend rather than intelligence about a particular country. I have set my probability below the pure statistical model to account for the inherent unpredictability and 'lumpiness' of diplomatic announcements, which do not always follow a smooth trend. A probability of 65% indicates that a signing is significantly more likely than not, but acknowledges a substantial chance that no signing will occur in this specific one-month window. My forecast is not higher because the accelerated rate of early 2025 may not be sustained, and without a specific country publicly nearing a decision, a higher certainty is unwarranted. It is not lower because ignoring the strong recent trend would be to underweight compelling evidence; forecasting below 60% would imply an abrupt and unexplained halt to the current momentum. I would raise my forecast upon news of a specific country preparing to sign, and lower it if there were a significant global event that diverts diplomatic focus away from space initiatives.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a country sign the Artemis Accords in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe most recent signatory was Bangladesh, on April 8, 2025 and [Norway](https://www.state.gov/united-states-welcomes-norways-signing-of-the-artemis-accords/) on May 15, 2025. There are 55 signatories at the time of this question: Angola, Argentina, Armenia, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, Peru, Poland, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay.

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a country becomes an Artemis Accord signatory after May 30, 2025 and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
