    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. Both brought up valuable points that refine my initial assessment. Forecaster 2 highlighted that 34 days have already passed with no news of closure, which rules out an exceptionally fast resolution and anchors the situation in a more standard, and potentially slower, timeline. Forecaster 3 provided the most compelling new piece of data: a specific base rate for similar FSIS recalls, which is typically 4-12 weeks. This is more precise than my general assumption. Forecaster 3 also made the excellent point that while Johnsonville is a competent company, its large-scale distribution could actually lengthen the verification process, a complication I had not fully weighed. I find Forecaster 3's reasoning, which leads to a 70% forecast, to be particularly convincing as it is grounded in a specific base rate that aligns with the facts of the case.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 75% was based on the nearly three-month window being generally sufficient for a company like Johnsonville to resolve this type of recall. After deliberation, I am revising my forecast slightly downward. The key driver for this change is the specific base rate provided by Forecaster 3, indicating a typical closure time of 4 to 12 weeks for foreign-matter recalls. The resolution date of July 1, 2025, is approximately 12.5 weeks after the initial recall on April 5. This places the deadline at the very upper end of the typical range. My initial forecast did not sufficiently account for the risk that this recall might take the full typical duration, or slightly longer, to resolve. A minor delay of even a few days past the 12-week mark would result in a 'No' outcome. Furthermore, Forecaster 3's point about the complexity of verification across a large national distribution network adds weight to the possibility of such a delay. While I still believe 'Yes' is the most likely outcome, the proximity of the deadline to the edge of the typical resolution window convinces me to reduce my confidence. I am not lowering my forecast to Forecaster 2's 40% as I believe the 4-12 week base rate still strongly favors a 'Yes' resolution over a 'No', and there is no specific evidence of complications to justify such a pessimistic outlook.",
