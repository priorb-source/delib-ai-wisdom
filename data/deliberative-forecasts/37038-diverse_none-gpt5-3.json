    "review": "Forecaster 2’s emphasis on institutional inertia, legal/process hurdles, and the very short runway is persuasive and aligns with how HTS changes typically occur. I agree that, absent concrete signals (proclamation, Federal Register notice, USITC supplement), the default is strongly No. Forecaster 3 adds a useful point I hadn’t explicitly weighed: the 17% figure may tie to a broader reciprocal-tariff concept floated in early 2025. However, even if a baseline across-the-board tariff were implemented, HTS practice would likely reflect this as a general rate/surcharge (often via Chapter 99) rather than an Israel-specific “IL 17%” listing across subheadings. The resolution seems to require an explicit IL=17% depiction, which is less likely than a general measure. Given the political context (a pro-Israel administration unlikely to single Israel out) and mechanics of HTS presentation, I find Forecaster 3’s 25% too high.",
    "rationale": "My prior forecast (7%) already reflected a small tail for an HTS entry listing 17% for Israel, including a suspended provision. The additional consideration that a 17% figure could emerge from a broad tariff plan does not materially raise the chance that the HTS would explicitly list “IL 17%” by June 1; if anything, it underscores that any new tariff would likely be general rather than Israel-specific in the HTS. With no public evidence of an imminent proclamation or USITC supplement targeting Israel’s IL rates, and only ~5 weeks remaining, I lower my estimate. Main upside risks would be: (1) a sudden proclamation explicitly setting IL rates at 17% (even if suspended), (2) a USITC HTS supplement previewing such language before June 1. Absent those, the modal outcome is no IL-specific 17% listing.",
