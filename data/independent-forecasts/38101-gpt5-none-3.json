    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~32 days until July 1, 2025 (Morning Consult uses a 7-day moving average and Metaculus may check the first update on/after that date, so practical resolution likely within the first week of July).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Ishiba’s approval is more likely to be at or above Starmer’s around late May/early June per recent patterns, and a tie would also resolve No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Both leaders’ approvals remain close to recent levels, with Ishiba at roughly the high-30s to mid-40s and Starmer in the low-to-mid 30s; or they tie.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ishiba’s approval slides meaningfully (e.g., into the low/mid-30s) due to a scandal, policy stumble, or economic setback in Japan, while Starmer holds steady or ticks up (e.g., to the upper-30s) on positive UK news, making Starmer’s approval higher on the July 1 reading window.",
    "rationale": "- What I know and don’t know: The research assistant provided no additional information, and I cannot fetch the latest Morning Consult figures. Historically through late 2024 and into early 2025, Morning Consult showed Japan’s new PM enjoying at least a short honeymoon bounce, whereas Starmer’s approval, while better than his predecessor’s, has not been especially high. That makes the base case that Ishiba is at least comparable to, and likely above, Starmer.\n- Methodology and inertia: Morning Consult uses a 7-day moving average, which damps short-term volatility. With about a month left, large swings are less likely; approval ratings usually move slowly absent major shocks. Because a tie resolves as No, the bar for Yes is a clean Starmer > Ishiba on or after July 1.\n- Why not higher: The status quo likely has Ishiba ≥ Starmer. Japan’s leadership transitions often produce a higher early approval than UK PMs typically get; inertia over the next month plus the tie-break rule favors No.\n- Why not lower: Japanese PM approvals can decline rapidly if a controversy breaks, and Ishiba’s honeymoon could fade. Conversely, Starmer could see a modest bounce if the UK sees positive economic or policy news. With only a small gap to overcome, a Yes is plausible.\n- What would move me: I would shift higher if upcoming Morning Consult weekly updates show convergence or Starmer overtaking Ishiba, or if there’s notable negative news in Japan. I would shift lower if Ishiba maintains mid-40s approval or Starmer drifts down into the low 30s, or if there’s a benign news cycle in both countries (preserving the status quo).",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
