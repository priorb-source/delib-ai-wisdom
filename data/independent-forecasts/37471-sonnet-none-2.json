    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6-7 weeks (FRED data for May 2025 is typically published in late June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the inventory remains near the February 2025 level of 500k, falling short of the 550k threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The spring/summer home buying season absorbs enough inventory to prevent further buildup. Buyers become more active as they adjust to rate environment, and builders moderate their listing pace. Inventory stabilizes in the 500-530k range through May, staying below 550k.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The upward trend from the past 13 years continues unabated. High mortgage rates keep buyer demand suppressed while builders complete projects at a strong pace. Inventory increases by roughly 15-20k per month from February through May, pushing past 550k by month's end.",
    "rationale": "Starting from 500k in February 2025, reaching 550k by end of May requires a 10% increase over approximately 3.5 months. This equates to roughly 14k units per month. The background information establishes a clear long-term upward trend - inventory has more than tripled from 142k over 13 years to reach the highest level since November 2007. However, several factors create uncertainty: (1) The timeframe is tight - achieving this increase during the traditional spring/summer buying season when demand typically picks up is challenging. (2) We lack granular monthly data between February and now to confirm if the trend is accelerating, stable, or decelerating. (3) At 500k, we're already at extremely elevated levels historically, which may trigger market adjustments. (4) Builders may moderate listings if inventory accumulates too much. The probability is meaningful but not dominant because while the long-term trend strongly supports continued increases, hitting this specific threshold in this specific short timeframe requires sustained momentum through the buying season. I'm not higher because 10% growth in ~3.5 months is aggressive and seasonal patterns typically favor absorption. I'm not lower because the established upward trend and current high-rate environment suppressing demand make continued inventory growth plausible. I would update higher with data showing March-April inventory continuing to rise rapidly (540k+), or lower with data showing stabilization or decrease in recent months.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of new single family homes for sale in the US exceed 550 thousand in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Kobeissi Letter](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1912142359577403619): \"BREAKING: The number of new single-family homes for sale has surged to 500,000 in February, the highest since November 2007.\n\nThe number of new homes on the market has more than TRIPLED over the last 13 years, from a low of 142,000.\n\nExcluding the 2006 housing bubble this is, by far, the largest supply of new homes in history.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of New One Family Homes for Sale in the United States reported for May 2025 is greater than 550 thousand, according to what is presented by [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HNFSEPUSSA).\n\nEnsure units is set to \"Thousands of Units, Seasonally Adjusted\" and frequency is set to \"Monthly, End of Month\". Question resolves based on the number presented by FRED, and no other resolution source will be considered.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
