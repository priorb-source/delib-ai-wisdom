    "review": "All three analyses converge on similar reasoning and a narrow 10-15% probability range, which increases my confidence in this assessment. Forecaster 2 raises a valuable point I underemphasized: the Liberal Democrats' 'traditional strength in Southwest local elections.' This is relevant given Cornwall's location and historical Lib Dem performance in the region at local level, though I note this hasn't translated to them ever being the largest party on Cornwall Council specifically. Forecaster 2's specific quantification (30+ seats of 87 total needed) helpfully clarifies the mathematical challenge. Both forecasters correctly note that the Electoral Calculus MRP poll was mentioned but details weren't provided - this missing information prevents a higher forecast. Forecaster 3's observation that Reform UK polls higher nationally (25%) than Lib Dems (14-16%) reinforces that Reform is better positioned to capture Conservative losses, not the Lib Dems. The convergence of reasoning and the 10-15% range suggests our collective analysis is sound.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I maintain that the core structural challenge remains overwhelming: a 31-seat deficit requiring the Lib Dems to nearly triple their representation while Conservatives collapse. However, Forecaster 2's emphasis on Lib Dem traditional strength in Southwest local elections warrants slight upward consideration. Cornwall's regional political culture may be more favorable to Lib Dems at local level than national polling suggests. The combination of Conservative organizational chaos (leader retiring), Reform vote-splitting, recent Westminster gains, and strong local campaign infrastructure creates conditions for outperformance. Yet the absence of MRP poll details showing Lib Dem competitiveness, their modest 14-16% national polling, and the likelihood that Reform rather than Lib Dems benefits from Conservative losses all constrain the upside. The unprecedented nature of the required swing remains the dominant factor.",
