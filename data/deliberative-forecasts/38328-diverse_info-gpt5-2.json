    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds specific triggers I hadn’t explicitly modeled: an alleged arrest (Fulvio Martusciello) and immunity-waiver votes slated for the June 16–19 plenary. If correct, those create concentrated pressure points inside our window. However, the inference that party “zero-tolerance” translates into swift seat resignations is overstated; in Qatargate, most implicated MEPs did not resign their mandates quickly (or at all), even under heavy pressure, and groups cannot force a resignation. So their 70% feels a bit high absent verified, imminent resignation signals or formal party demands to quit. Forecaster 3’s mechanism (government formation/cabinet appointments) is plausible in general, but their factual premise about a May 18 Portugal election and “rumors” of Portuguese MEPs moving to cabinet looks shaky/unsourced; I discount this argument materially. Their 40% seems low versus base-rate math for a 3-week span in year one of the term.\n",
    "rationale": "Base rate: 80–120 replacements over five years implies ~1–2 per month. For a ~21-day window (Jun 10–30), a Poisson approximation gives ~50–75% for ≥1 resignation; early-term turnover nudges toward the upper half of that range. June plenary weeks also raise the chance that resignations, if decided, are announced and recorded inside the window. Scandal factor: The Huawei lobbying affair plausibly increases hazard, especially if immunity waivers are voted mid‑June. But past precedent shows many implicated MEPs resist resigning; party sanctions typically stop at suspensions. Net effect is a modest upward tilt, not a wholesale jump. New info from Forecaster 2 (immunity votes timing) marginally strengthens the case for a resignation within the window; I weight this lightly given uncertainty around the arrest claim and behavioral precedent. Forecaster 3’s cabinet‑appointment pathway is not persuasive here due to weak sourcing. I therefore make a small upward adjustment from my prior (60% → 62%), reflecting slightly more concentrated triggers but preserving caution on actual seat resignations.\n",
