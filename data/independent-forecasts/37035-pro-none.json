    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Travel Health Notice for Colombia would remain at Level 2 or below.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current Yellow Fever outbreak in Colombia is contained or its risk to U.S. travelers is deemed manageable by the CDC with existing recommendations for vaccination and enhanced precautions. No other significant health crisis emerges, and the CDC does not see sufficient reason to elevate the country's travel health notice level.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Yellow Fever outbreak escalates significantly, with a rapid increase in cases spreading to major urban centers or tourist destinations. The situation overwhelms local healthcare capacity, leading the CDC to determine there is a high risk to U.S. travelers, prompting an upgrade of the Travel Health Notice to Level 3 ('Reconsider Travel') or Level 4 ('Do Not Travel').",
    "rationale": "This forecast is weighted heavily towards the status quo, as institutional risk assessments like the CDC's Travel Health Notices tend to exhibit inertia, especially over short timeframes. The current notice for Colombia is Level 2, and an escalation to Level 3 or 4 represents a significant policy change. The primary potential driver is the reported Yellow Fever outbreak. However, Yellow Fever is a known, vaccine-preventable disease, and the current Level 2 advisory already recommends vaccination and enhanced precautions. For the CDC to raise the level, the outbreak would need to worsen dramatically, spreading uncontrollably into areas frequented by travelers and overwhelming local healthcare resources. While the article headline is alarming, it is not, by itself, evidence of an imminent CDC policy change. My probability is not lower than 15% because the outbreak represents a genuine, plausible trigger for a re-evaluation by the CDC, and infectious disease situations can change rapidly. The probability is not higher because the bar for a Level 3 or 4 notice is high, and the existence of an effective vaccine is a powerful mitigating factor from the perspective of traveler safety. I would update this forecast upwards on credible reports (e.g., from the WHO or CDC) of exponential case growth in Colombian cities. I would update it downwards if reports show the outbreak is contained or as time passes without any official change.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Travel Health Notice status of Colombia](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/colombia), which is \"Level 2 Practice Enhanced Precautions\" at the time of this question, is a level of greater than 2 when checked by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
