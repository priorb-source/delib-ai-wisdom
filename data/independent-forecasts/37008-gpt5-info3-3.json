  "information": "As of April 21, 2025, the Samoan government had not announced any plans to extend the state of emergency. The National Emergency Operation Centre's update on April 15 confirmed that emergency orders were valid until April 29. The crisis has had a significant economic impact, estimated at a 16% hit to the country's GDP.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No: the current emergency order runs through April 29, 2025, and no extension has been announced as of April 21.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Power generation and fuel supply stabilize enough for the government to let the March 31 state of emergency lapse on April 29 without issuing a new proclamation or extension.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Rolling blackouts or fuel/ generation constraints persist, and the Cabinet/Prime Minister issues an extension or a new state of emergency that remains in force on April 30.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/status: The government’s proclamation on March 31 is scheduled to be in effect through April 29. The National Emergency Operation Centre’s April 15 update reiterated orders are valid until April 29. As of April 21, there are no public plans to extend. \n- Baseline/status quo: With a hard end date of April 29 and no extension signals yet, the default outcome is that the SoE expires before April 30 (resolves No). Good forecasting puts extra weight on this status quo. \n- Reasons for a higher probability (of Yes): The underlying issue—electricity generation shortfalls tied to fuel and/or plant constraints—can be stubborn. Governments often extend emergency powers close to expiry if conditions haven’t normalized. The reported economic impact underscores severity, increasing odds of at least a short extension. \n- Reasons for a lower probability (of Yes): If fuel deliveries and generation capacity have improved sufficiently by late April, political and economic incentives favor letting the SoE lapse and managing via standard regulatory tools. The absence of extension hints by April 21 nudges odds toward expiry on schedule. \n- What would move me up: Credible reports in the coming week of continued widespread blackouts, fuel shortages, or official statements from the PM/Cabinet or NEOC indicating an extension is under consideration. Any draft/proclamation posted to official channels (Govt website, Facebook) would quickly push this near 100%. \n- What would move me down: Announcements that supply is stabilized, rolling blackouts have ended, or explicit statements that the SoE will lapse on April 29 without renewal. \nBalancing these, I see a meaningful but sub-50% chance of a last-minute extension keeping an SoE in force on April 30.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count. (Note that when it was declared, it was scheduled to be in effect through April 29, 2025.)\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of April 21, 2025, the Samoan government had not announced any plans to extend the state of emergency. The National Emergency Operation Centre's update on April 15 confirmed that emergency orders were valid until April 29. The crisis has had a significant economic impact, estimated at a 16% hit to the country's GDP.\n\nToday is 2025-04-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
