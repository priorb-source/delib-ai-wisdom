  "information": "The 2025 Derbyshire County Council election is scheduled for May 1, 2025. This election will use new divisional boundaries, increasing the total number of seats from 61 to 64. Elections for the council operate under a First-Past-The-Post system. According to an assessment, the Conservative Party holds 57 of the 64 seats under the new boundaries. Reform UK currently holds zero seats on the council.\n\nAs a newer political party, Reform UK does not have the established local infrastructure and grassroots organization of the main parties active in Derbyshire. The party has encountered issues with candidate vetting, including a controversy involving their candidate for Bakewell, Max Bethell, who reportedly made racial slurs on social media. Historically, predecessor parties like UKIP and the Brexit Party did not succeed in translating national support into control of county councils.\n\nNational polling data shows support for Reform UK at approximately 23-25%. A March MRP poll by The Telegraph provided data for the region. The party has confirmed it is running a full slate of candidates across Derbyshire. Political scientist Professor John Curtice has noted that Reform UK's voter support may be more geographically concentrated than widely distributed.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 10 days. The election is on May 1, 2025, and results will be known shortly after.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Conservative Party holds a commanding notional majority of seats (57 of 64) under the new boundaries, while Reform UK holds zero seats on the council.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative Party retains the most seats, although likely with a reduced majority, or the Labour Party becomes the main beneficiary of a swing against the government and wins the most seats. Despite a notable vote share, Reform UK's support is too thinly spread across the county to win more than a few individual seats under the First-Past-The-Post system.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "There is an unprecedented collapse of the Conservative vote, with the vast majority of these voters switching directly and efficiently to Reform UK. This support proves to be highly concentrated in a large number of specific divisions, allowing Reform to win a plurality of seats and become the largest party on the council, leapfrogging both the Conservatives and Labour.",
    "rationale": "This forecast is based on the immense structural barriers facing a new party in a local First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) election. The starting position is the most critical factor: the Conservatives notionally hold 57 of 64 seats, while Reform UK holds zero. Overcoming such a deficit is historically unprecedented. The FPTP system rewards geographically concentrated support, and it is a significant hurdle for parties whose support is broadly distributed, which is often the case for new populist movements. While national polls for Reform are high, this rarely translates directly into winning a plurality of local council seats. Established parties have superior local infrastructure, name recognition, and campaigning experience. Historical precedent from similar parties like UKIP and the Brexit Party shows a failure to convert national momentum into widespread control of local councils. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the combination of Conservative incumbency, the FPTP system, and Reform's lack of a local track record makes a win extraordinarily difficult. My probability is not zero because the political environment is volatile, and a complete, localized collapse of the Conservative vote in favor of Reform is not impossible, just extremely unlikely. For me to increase this forecast, I would need to see credible local, division-level polling showing Reform with a clear lead in at least 20-25 divisions. Conversely, I would lower it if polling indicated the anti-Conservative swing was primarily benefiting the Labour party.",
