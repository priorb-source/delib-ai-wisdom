    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most compelling new argument: approximately 4 months have elapsed since the January 2025 executive order, yet the North America page remains unchanged. This temporal evidence significantly strengthens the case for status quo persistence. If WorldAtlas intended to adopt the new name on their primary map pages, the natural time would have been shortly after the executive order when it was newsworthy. The fact that they added '(Gulf of America)' to the article title but NOT to the North America page suggests this parenthetical acknowledgment represents their equilibrium position - a compromise that acknowledges the controversy without fully adopting the politically-driven name change on their authoritative reference materials. Forecaster 2's point that 54 days provides sufficient time for updates is technically correct but misses that the lack of action over the previous 4 months is itself meaningful evidence about WorldAtlas's editorial stance. Both forecasters correctly emphasize the article page versus North America page distinction, which I had noted but perhaps underweighted.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the elapsed time argument is decisive. WorldAtlas has had 4 months to implement changes and chose only to add a parenthetical note to one article, not to update their primary North America reference page. This pattern reveals their editorial philosophy: acknowledge controversial naming disputes in specific articles while maintaining established geographic nomenclature on authoritative map pages. This is consistent with how reference websites typically handle politically-motivated geographic name changes lacking international consensus. The resolution criteria do allow both names together, which prevents me from going as low as 15%, since WorldAtlas could theoretically add similar parenthetical text to the North America page. However, their behavior over 4 months suggests they view their current approach as appropriate. I'm updating downward from 25% to 20% based primarily on the elapsed time evidence.",
