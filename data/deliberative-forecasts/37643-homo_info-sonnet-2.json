    "review": "Both forecasters raise important points I hadn't fully considered. Forecaster 2 provides crucial new information: an executive order was signed March 7, 2025 (over 2 months ago). This is significant concrete action. However, Forecaster 2's interpretation that this warrants 25% seems too optimistic given that the objective has remained 'in progress' for 2+ months despite this executive action - suggesting the tracker maintainers require a higher bar for 'complete' than just executive orders. Forecaster 3 makes an excellent statutory point: PSLF is established by federal law (20 U.S.C. §1087e(m)), meaning true termination requires Congressional action, not just executive modifications. This strengthens the case for a lower probability. Forecaster 3's 10% is very close to my initial 8% and their reasoning about procedural barriers aligns well with mine. The most important revelation from this deliberation is that despite an executive order being issued 2+ months ago, the tracker still shows 'in progress' - this is actually bearish for completion by July 1, not bullish.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I'm updating my forecast slightly upward but not dramatically. The March 7 executive order represents more concrete action than I initially realized, creating scenarios where aggressive implementation or additional executive actions could potentially lead the tracker maintainers to mark this complete. However, the fact that it remains 'in progress' 2+ months post-executive order is actually strong evidence against completion by July 1 - if the tracker maintained hasn't marked it complete after 2+ months, they likely require full termination or comprehensive implementation, not just executive directives. Forecaster 3's statutory argument is compelling: genuine termination of a statutorily-established program requires Congressional action, which is extremely unlikely in 48 days. The research assistant's report about the rulemaking committee having its first session June 30-July 2 (right at the deadline) with rules expected 'later in 2025' further confirms completion is unlikely by July 1. I'm updating from 8% to 12% primarily because the executive order shows more momentum than I initially assumed, but I don't find Forecaster 2's 25% justified given the strong countervailing evidence of the prolonged 'in progress' status and statutory/procedural barriers.",
