    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "NOAA typically releases monthly climate data within 1-2 weeks after month end. Since today is June 2, 2025 and May just ended, the outcome should be known within 10-14 days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo is that May 2025 is NOT the hottest May on record. While we are in a period of exceptional warming, the default probability for any individual month being a record is still less than 50%, as there are over 140 years of May temperature records to exceed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 temperatures remain below the current record (likely held by May 2023 or May 2024). This could occur due to natural variability, a transition from El Niño to neutral or La Niña conditions dampening global temperatures, regional cooling patterns, or volcanic aerosols affecting solar radiation. Even with long-term warming, not every month exceeds the previous record.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 exceeds the previous May temperature record. This would be consistent with the ongoing climate trend where 2023 and 2024 saw numerous monthly records broken. Contributing factors could include continued greenhouse gas forcing, residual El Niño effects, reduced aerosol cooling, or amplifying feedbacks in the climate system.",
    "rationale": "The 2023-2024 period has been exceptional for record-breaking temperatures globally, with many consecutive months setting new records. This creates a high base rate for record temperatures. However, several factors moderate my confidence: (1) Even in strong warming periods, natural variability means not every month breaks records - perhaps 50-70% of months in 2023-2024 set records, not 100%. (2) We may be transitioning from El Niño conditions, which typically boost global temperatures, toward neutral or La Niña conditions. (3) My research assistant provided no preliminary data about May 2025 temperatures, so I'm forecasting without specific information about how warm the month actually was. The lack of information is significant - if May 2025 were dramatically warm, preliminary reports would likely be available. (4) The previous May record is likely from very recent years (2023 or 2024), making it a high bar to exceed. My forecast is not higher because I lack specific data suggesting May 2025 was exceptionally warm, and because the transition away from El Niño could moderate temperatures. My forecast is not lower because the recent trend has been very strong, the long-term warming signal is clear, and base rates from recent years suggest roughly 40-50% of months break records. I would update higher if preliminary NOAA data or reports suggested May 2025 was exceptionally warm globally. I would update lower if reports indicated cooler-than-expected May conditions or if La Niña conditions had strengthened significantly.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA report that May 2025 is the hottest May on record?\n\nQuestion background:\n[NOAA Climate change impacts](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NOAA at its [Climate at a Glance Global Rankings](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/rankings/globe/tavg/land_ocean/202504) tracker reports that May 2025 is the 1st warmest on record.\n\nEnsure that Region is set to Global. Ensure that Surface is set to Land and Ocean.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
