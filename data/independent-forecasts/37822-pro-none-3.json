    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Beto O'Rourke is not a declared candidate for US Senator from Texas.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without Beto O'Rourke formally announcing a campaign. He may continue to make public appearances and comment on politics, but concludes that another statewide run is not viable at this time due to fundraising challenges, unfavorable polling, or personal reasons.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In response to what he perceives as a groundswell of support, or perhaps seeing a strategic opening, Beto O'Rourke holds a press conference or releases a video in June 2025 formally declaring his candidacy for the US Senate.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on several key factors, with significant weight given to the status quo. Currently, Beto O'Rourke is not a candidate, and it takes considerable momentum and planning to launch a major Senate campaign. The deadline is just over a month away, which is a very short timeline for such a significant decision and announcement.\n\nO'Rourke's electoral history is a major consideration. While he ran a surprisingly close race against Ted Cruz in 2018, he has since lost two other major campaigns: the 2020 presidential primary (withdrew early) and the 2022 Texas gubernatorial race, which he lost by a convincing 11-point margin. This history of losses can create donor fatigue and voter skepticism, making a fourth major run difficult.\n\nThe provided background information, where O'Rourke says he will run 'if' Texans want him to, is a classic political trial balloon. It allows him to gauge public interest without making a commitment and is not strong evidence of a forthcoming announcement.\n\nWhy the forecast is not lower: The probability is not closer to zero because O'Rourke remains one of the most prominent Democrats in Texas with a significant national profile and fundraising network. His statement explicitly keeps the door open, and he is known for taking on challenging races. A sudden political shift or positive polling could quickly change his calculus.\n\nWhy the forecast is not higher: The probability is not higher because the fundamental obstacles are significant. The short timeline, the political challenges for a Democrat running statewide in Texas, and the baggage of his previous losses make an announcement before July 1st unlikely. Most potential candidates who 'consider' a run do not end up running. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see concrete evidence of campaign preparations, such as key staff hires, FEC filings, or a significant shift in polling in his favor.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Beto O'Rourke announce his candidacy for US Senator from Texas before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFort Worth Star-Telegram: [Beto O’Rourke says ‘if’ Texans want him to run for U.S. Senate, ‘yes I will'](https://www.star-telegram.com/opinion/bud-kennedy)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Beto O'Rourke announces his candidacy for US Senator from Texas before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
