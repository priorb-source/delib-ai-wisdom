    "status_quo_outcome": "Real estate transactions in Nigeria remain subject to Value Added Tax (VAT), as the proposed legislative change is not enacted.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Tax Reforms Bill, which includes the VAT exemption, becomes stalled in the National Assembly due to debates over other, more contentious provisions within the same bill. The legislative process, including committee reviews and reconciliation between the two houses, takes longer than the time available, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without the bill being signed into law.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Leveraging strong support from the Federal Government and public approval for measures aimed at increasing housing affordability, the National Assembly fast-tracks the Tax Reforms Bill. It passes through both chambers and receives presidential assent in June 2025, successfully enacting the VAT exemption for real estate transactions before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 65% is based on the strong political momentum behind this bill, balanced against the significant procedural hurdles of a short legislative timeline. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is that this is a Federal Government (FG) sponsored bill, as indicated by the provided article. Executive-backed legislation with a popular goal, such as 'boosting housing affordability,' tends to have a much higher chance of passage than an average bill. The policy is already framed and is reportedly being considered, meaning it has overcome initial inertia. However, the timeline is very tight. Less than two months remain before the July 1, 2025 deadline. The Nigerian legislative process involves multiple readings, committee stages, and passage through two separate chambers (House and Senate) before presidential assent. This process can be easily delayed. The VAT exemption is part of a larger 'Tax Reforms Bill', which could contain other elements that attract opposition or procedural delays, holding up the entire package. My probability is not higher because the risk of legislative gridlock or simply running out of time is substantial. A complex bill can easily get bogged down, and any unforeseen political issue could divert the government's attention. My probability is not lower because the explicit, high-level government backing for a popular policy is a powerful driver that makes swift passage plausible, overcoming the usual legislative drag. I would increase my forecast upon news that the bill has passed either the House or the Senate. I would decrease it if credible reports emerge of significant political opposition or if the legislative calendar becomes focused on a different priority.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Nigeria enact legislation exempting real estate transactions from VAT before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[FG: Tax reform bill to exempt real estate transactions from VAT, boost housing affordability in Nigeria](https://nairametrics.com/2025/04/25/fg-tax-reform-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat-boost-housing-affordability-in-nigeria/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the government of Nigeria enacts legislation exempting real estate transactions from the Value Added Tax (VAT) according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions).\n\nFor example, the current iteration of the Tax Reforms Bill that is [being considered](https://brtnews.ng/tax-reforms-bill-to-exempt-real-estate-transactions-from-vat/) by the National Assembly, if it should be enacted, would count for purposes of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
