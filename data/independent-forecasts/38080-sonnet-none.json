    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Harvard does not have SEVP certification",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration maintains its revocation of Harvard's SEVP certification through July 1, 2025. Harvard's legal challenges proceed through the courts but don't result in immediate restoration. The standoff continues over academic freedom, student privacy, and campus issues, with no settlement or court order forcing restoration of the certification in the 34-day window.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A federal court grants Harvard an emergency injunction forcing immediate restoration of SEVP certification, or the administration and Harvard reach a rapid negotiated settlement under pressure from the severity of the situation affecting 6,800 students. Alternatively, significant political or diplomatic pressure forces the administration to reverse course before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Harvard's certification was revoked only 6 days ago on May 22, 2025, and we have just 34 days until the resolution date. World changes slowly, and bureaucratic/legal processes take time. Legal challenges typically require months, not weeks, even with emergency motions. The process involves filing, hearings, decisions, and potential appeals. Getting an emergency injunction within 34 days would be exceptionally fast. The Trump administration appears deeply committed to this hardline position, having already pulled $4 billion in funding, suggesting they won't back down quickly without significant pressure. However, I'm not forecasting lower than 18% because: (1) The stakes are extraordinarily high with 6,800 students affected, creating urgency, (2) Harvard has enormous resources and legal firepower, (3) Courts can sometimes act rapidly in genuine emergencies, (4) The action is so extreme and unprecedented that it could generate unexpected political backlash or intervention, (5) The severity might prompt settlement negotiations. For me to update higher, I'd need to see: emergency court hearings scheduled, active settlement talks, or political pressure mounting. To update lower: administration doubling down, court dismissals, or no progress in coming days. The short timeframe and recent timing of the revocation heavily favor maintaining the status quo of no certification.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-28.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
