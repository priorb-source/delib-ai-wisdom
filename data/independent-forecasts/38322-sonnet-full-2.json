  "information": "The final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment index for May 2025 was 52.2, an improvement from the preliminary reading of 50.8, but a decline from 57.0 in March and 64.7 in February. The index has fallen nearly 30% since January 2025. Within the May report, the Current Economic Conditions Index decreased to 58.9 points from 59.8 in April, while the Economic Expectations Index increased to 47.9 points from 47.3. In a separate survey, the Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 98 in May from a revised 85.7 in the prior month. Other economic indicators showed soft growth signals, with the ISM services index at 49.9 and the manufacturing index at 48.5.\n\nInflation expectations remain a significant concern for consumers. The May University of Michigan survey showed consumer expectations for inflation over the next year increased to 7.3% from 6.5% in April, while long-term inflation expectations rose to 4.6% from 4.4%. Trade policy is also a major factor; according to the survey's director, Joanne Hsu, nearly three-quarters of consumers mentioned tariffs and trade policies as a source of uncertainty. Recent policy actions include the doubling of US steel tariffs. Federal Reserve governor Christopher Waller has outlined a potential path to interest rate cuts later in the year but noted this depends on how trade negotiations unfold and on progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation goal.\n\nAmerican consumers are exhibiting cautious behavior. Personal spending rose by only 0.2% in the last reported month, while the savings rate surged to 4.9% in March, the highest level in almost a year. Consumers are reportedly focusing more on essential goods and services. This caution is reflected in the performance of discount retailers like Dollar General, which recently hiked its sales forecast. Household finances are also under pressure from debt; following the end of the pandemic-era payment pause, student loan delinquencies jumped to 7.74% from 1%.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 23 days until June 27, 2025, when the University of Michigan will release the June 2025 Consumer Sentiment Final Report on the final Friday of June.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - the May 2025 final reading was 52.2, which is already below the 54.0 threshold. If sentiment remains at current levels or continues recent trends, the outcome would be Yes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment improves by at least 1.8 points from May's 52.2 to reach 54.0 or higher in June. This could occur if trade policy uncertainty diminishes significantly, tariff concerns ease, inflation expectations decline, or positive economic news emerges that substantially shifts consumer outlook within the next three weeks.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment remains below 54.0 in June, either staying near current levels or declining further. This occurs if the persistent concerns about tariffs, trade policy, and elevated inflation expectations continue to weigh on consumer attitudes, with no significant positive catalysts emerging in the short time remaining before the survey.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome since May's final reading of 52.2 is already 1.8 points below the 54.0 threshold. The index has shown a clear downward trajectory: 64.7 in February → 57.0 in March → 52.2 in May (final), representing a nearly 30% decline since January 2025. Key structural concerns persist: three-quarters of consumers cite tariffs and trade policies as uncertainty sources, inflation expectations remain elevated at 7.3% for the next year and 4.6% long-term (well above the Fed's 2% target), and consumer behavior reflects caution with the savings rate at 4.9% and student loan delinquencies jumping to 7.74%. Only 23 days remain until the outcome, and major sentiment shifts rarely occur over such short periods without significant catalysts. However, my probability is not higher because: (1) the May preliminary reading of 50.8 revised upward to 52.2, showing revision potential, (2) we're relatively close to the threshold, (3) the Conference Board index showed sharp improvement (to 98 from 85.7), and (4) the Economic Expectations component improved slightly. My forecast would increase toward 85%+ if June preliminary data shows further decline or if trade/tariff tensions escalate. It would decrease toward 50-60% if major trade deals are announced or Fed signals imminent rate cuts that substantially improve market sentiment.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
