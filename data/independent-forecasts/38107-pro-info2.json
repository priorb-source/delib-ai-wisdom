  "information": "Several public figures have called for legal action against James Comey. General Michael Flynn predicted that Comey will be indicted. The InfoWars platform cited alleged Department of Justice sources claiming Comey's indictment is 'imminent.' Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett stated that Comey could be prosecuted for the post. Current FBI Director Chris Wray reported that the agency has faced a surge in threats against Donald Trump following Comey's post, requiring agents to be diverted from other cases.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one month, with the question resolving on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Former high-level officials like James Comey are not arrested, and the status quo is that he remains a private citizen without being taken into custody.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Secret Service completes its inquiry into Comey's social media post and determines that it does not meet the legal standard of a 'true threat.' While political commentators continue to call for his prosecution, the Department of Justice does not find sufficient cause to issue an arrest warrant. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without Comey being arrested for any reason.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The investigation into the '86 47' post uncovers additional evidence suggesting a direct intent to threaten or incite violence. Under significant political pressure and citing the surge in threats against Donald Trump, the DOJ authorizes an arrest. Alternatively, Comey is arrested for a completely unrelated matter before the deadline, such as a traffic violation that escalates or a public disturbance, which would also satisfy the broad criteria of the question.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the extremely high bar for arresting a former FBI director and the weakness of the publicly available evidence. The status quo is that figures like Comey are not arrested; this is the most powerful factor supporting a 'No' outcome.\n\nThe research assistant's report largely consists of political commentary and reporting from biased sources (Flynn, InfoWars), which I assign very low weight. The statement from legal analyst Gregg Jarrett is speculative opinion, not an indication of prosecutorial intent. The most significant piece of information is from FBI Director Wray, confirming the post has had real-world consequences by generating threats. This elevates the seriousness of the situation for law enforcement but does not automatically translate to probable cause for arresting Comey himself.\n\nThe core legal issue is whether the ambiguous seashell post constitutes a 'true threat,' a standard that is intentionally high to protect free speech. It is unlikely that this post, on its own, would clear that hurdle. Furthermore, federal investigations into high-profile individuals, especially those with First Amendment implications, typically move much slower than the one-month timeframe available here.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 3% because the Secret Service is officially involved, and in a volatile political climate, actions that were previously unthinkable can occur. The broad definition of 'arrest' also allows for low-probability, unrelated events to trigger a 'Yes' outcome. My forecast is not higher because there are no credible, non-partisan reports of a grand jury, a formal criminal target letter, or other concrete steps toward prosecution. The public information points to an inquiry, not an imminent arrest.\n\nI would update my forecast higher if credible sources reported that the DOJ had officially opened a criminal investigation into Comey or if more direct evidence of intent emerged. I would update lower if the Secret Service or DOJ were to issue a statement concluding their inquiry without action.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill James Comey be arrested before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Secret Service Is Asking Comey About a Photo of Seashells Spelling ‘86 47’](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/us/politics/secret-service-comey-social-media-trump.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if former FBI director James Comey is arrested before July 1, 2025, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nIn order to streamline this question's resolution, please note that an arrest anywhere in the world, for any reason, will resolve this question as Yes. For purposes of this question, we define \"arrest\" using the definition [posted at Nolo](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/justifies-arrest-probable-cause.html): \"An arrest requires taking someone into custody, against that person's will, in order to prosecute or interrogate. It involves a physical application of force, or submission to an officer's show of force. In sum, the arrestee must not be free to leave. Whether the act by the police is termed an arrest under state law is not relevant. When deciding whether someone has been arrested, courts apply the 'reasonable man' standard. This means asking whether a reasonable person, in the shoes of the defendant, would have concluded that he or she was not free to leave.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral public figures have called for legal action against James Comey.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
