    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 33 days. The outcome will be known on June 1, 2025, when we can verify whether any posts appeared on Virgin Galactic's news page during May 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Virgin Galactic continues to not post on their news page",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic publishes at least one news post in May 2025, perhaps announcing Q1 2025 earnings results, an operational update, a strategic announcement, or any other company news that warrants a public update on their news page.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic maintains its current pattern of very sparse communication and goes the entire month of May 2025 without making any posts to their news page, extending their silence from January 30 to at least June 1 - a period of over 4 months without updates.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a YES resolution. Virgin Galactic's posting pattern shows significant inactivity: a 7-week gap between December 12, 2024 and January 30, 2025, followed by the current 13-week gap (approximately 3 months) from January 30 to April 29. This pattern indicates the company posts very infrequently, likely only when they have significant announcements. The fact that they've already gone nearly 3 months without posting suggests they may not be operationally active enough or don't have sufficient news to warrant frequent updates. However, several factors prevent me from forecasting higher: (1) Public companies typically report quarterly earnings, and Q1 2025 results might be announced in May; (2) A 4+ month silence would be exceptionally long even for a quiet company; (3) The longer the silence extends, the more likely something material might need to be communicated. Factors preventing a lower forecast include the clear established pattern of very sparse posting and no indication from the research assistant of any imminent announcements. For me to revise upward (more confident in no posting), I'd need evidence that Virgin Galactic has suspended operations, is in financial distress requiring minimal disclosure, or has explicitly announced a communications hiatus. For me to revise downward (more likely they'll post), I'd need information about scheduled earnings releases, upcoming operational milestones, or regulatory filing deadlines in May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
