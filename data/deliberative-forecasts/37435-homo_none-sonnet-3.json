    "review": "All three forecasters arrived at remarkably similar conclusions (7-12% range) through nearly identical reasoning, which provides confidence in the analytical framework. We all emphasized: (1) the extremely short 57-day window, (2) low base rates for public company bankruptcies in such timeframes, (3) the documented AI disruption to Chegg's business model, (4) the multiple alternatives companies typically exhaust before bankruptcy, and (5) the lack of specific evidence of imminent crisis. Forecaster 3's higher forecast (12%) acknowledges more tail risk from unexpected liquidity crises, which is a valid point - even if rare, sudden financial shocks can materialize quickly. Forecaster 2's lower forecast (7%) weights more heavily toward the status quo given the compressed timeframe. However, no forecaster introduced substantive new evidence or arguments that fundamentally alter the analysis. The key insight is that all of us independently converged on a low-but-not-negligible probability, suggesting this range appropriately captures both the real risks from business model disruption and the low likelihood of bankruptcy materialization in just 57 days absent specific crisis indicators.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I find the collective reasoning sound and my original analysis well-calibrated. The 7-12% range represents appropriate uncertainty given limited financial data. No forecaster provided evidence of imminent bankruptcy triggers - no reported covenant violations, liquidity emergencies, failed financing attempts, or creditor actions. The WSJ article confirms serious competitive challenges but doesn't indicate acute insolvency. While Forecaster 3's point about unexpected crises is valid, dramatically increasing my forecast without concrete evidence would overweight tail scenarios. Conversely, going below 7% would underweight the genuine uncertainty from lacking current financial statements and the documented business model disruption. The group convergence at 7-12% without coordination suggests this range is well-reasoned. I'll adjust marginally toward the group mean to acknowledge Forecaster 3's tail risk consideration while maintaining that absent specific crisis indicators, the probability remains low for such a near-term event.",
