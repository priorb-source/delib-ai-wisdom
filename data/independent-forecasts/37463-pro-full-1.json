  "information": "As of the last filing for Q4 2024, Berkshire Hathaway held approximately 10.7 million shares of Amazon. For 10 consecutive quarters, the company has been a net seller of equities. In Q1 2025, Berkshire increased its cash reserves to a record of approximately $348 billion. During that same quarter, the company's operating earnings declined by 14.1%, and no stock repurchases were made. New investments were focused on the energy sector and Japanese trading firms.\n\nWarren Buffett has announced his intention to step down as CEO by the end of 2025, with Greg Abel set to succeed him. Following the announcement, a Stocktwits poll indicated that 46% of retail investors still view Berkshire Hathaway as a long-term 'buy', and retail sentiment on the stock was described as 'extremely bullish'. UBS analysts stated that the company's structural advantages, including its permanent capital and information collection capabilities, are not expected to be significantly reduced by the leadership change.\n\nAnalysts from sources including NASDAQ and The Motley Fool have highlighted Amazon's growth potential, particularly through its cloud infrastructure service, Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is reportedly growing by a high-teens percentage year-over-year. In May 2025, both JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley raised their target price for Amazon stock to $230.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one week. The 13F filing for the quarter ending March 31, 2025, is due within 45 days of the quarter's end, which is approximately May 15, 2025. The current date is May 8, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. As of the last filing for Q4 2024, Berkshire Hathaway held approximately 10.7 million shares of Amazon. If they made no changes to this position, their holding would remain above the 10,000,000 share threshold, resulting in a 'Yes' outcome.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway sells at least 700,001 shares of Amazon during Q1 2025, reducing its total holdings to 10,000,000 or fewer shares. This action would align with their recent trend of being a net seller of equities to build up their cash reserves.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire Hathaway's holdings of Amazon stock remain above 10,000,000 shares. This could happen if the company either held its position steady, sold fewer than 700,000 shares, or added to its position during Q1 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the status quo. Berkshire Hathaway's last reported holding of Amazon was ~10.7 million shares, which is already above the 10 million share threshold required for a 'Yes' resolution. For the outcome to be 'No', Berkshire would have needed to make an active decision to sell over 700,000 shares in Q1 2025. While the company has been a net seller of equities for 10 consecutive quarters and is building a record cash pile, this does not necessitate trimming every position. The bullish analyst sentiment on Amazon, driven by the growth of Amazon Web Services (AWS), makes a significant sale less likely. The Amazon stake is widely considered a pick by one of Warren Buffett's investment managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, who may have high conviction in the long-term holding. Therefore, the most probable scenarios are that Berkshire either held the position steady or trimmed it by an amount insufficient to fall below the 10 million share threshold. The probability is not higher because Berkshire's consistent net selling over the past 2.5 years represents a significant and established pattern of behavior. It is a real possibility that the Amazon position was trimmed as part of this broader strategy to raise cash and rotate into other sectors like energy. The probability is not lower because the path to a 'Yes' outcome requires only minor action or inaction (i.e., not selling ~7% of the position), which is the path of least resistance, especially given Amazon's strong business outlook. I would lower my forecast if I received information indicating a specific negative view on Amazon from within Berkshire, and I would raise it if there was any specific bullish commentary on the company from its leadership.",
