  "information": "The original proposal is being reworked into a broader rule that would prohibit pushing or pulling a ball carrier anywhere on the field, not just in the specific quarterback sneak formation. This change aims to frame the issue around general football principles rather than targeting a specific team. On the other hand, the NFL's health and safety department possesses no data indicating any injuries have occurred from the 'Tush Push'. The Philadelphia Eagles, who have used the play with a high success rate, have vocally opposed the ban.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 3 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The 'Tush-Push' remains a legal play in the NFL.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The NFL owners fail to reach the required 24-vote supermajority to pass a rule change before the June 1, 2025 deadline. Disagreements on the scope of the a potential ban and the lack of a strong safety argument cause the proposal to be voted down or tabled, leaving the play legal for the upcoming season.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At a late-May owners' meeting, the competition committee successfully proposes a reworked, broader rule that prohibits pushing or pulling a ball carrier anywhere on the field. This reframing convinces a supermajority of owners (24 or more) who are concerned about the play's sporting aesthetic, leading to an official announcement of the ban before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards the status quo, where the 'Tush-Push' remains legal. The single most significant factor supporting this is the lack of a compelling safety argument. As my research notes, the NFL's health and safety department has no data indicating the play causes an abnormal number of injuries. This removes the strongest impetus for rule changes in the modern NFL. Furthermore, passing a new rule requires a 24-vote supermajority, a high bar to clear, especially when a successful team like the Philadelphia Eagles is actively lobbying against it. The fact that a previous vote was tabled already indicates a lack of strong consensus. While there's momentum for a ban, the strategy of broadening the rule to cover all pushing/pulling could backfire by creating unintended consequences that make more owners hesitant to vote yes. The deadline is also very close, leaving little time to build the necessary coalition for a significant change.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 35% because there is significant political will from a portion of owners and the competition committee to ban the play. The 'spirit of the game' and competitive balance arguments are potent. The reporting that an expansive ban 'could have strong support' suggests the strategic reframing of the issue might be an effective way to garner the necessary votes by making it seem less like a targeted rule against one team. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because overcoming institutional inertia without a clear safety mandate is extremely difficult. The status quo is a powerful force, and the high voting threshold is designed to prevent reactionary rule changes. Unless a major voting bloc shifts, the opponents of the play likely remain short of the 24 votes required. \n\nI would increase my probability if credible reports emerge that key undecided owners are now in favor of the ban or that a pre-vote whip count shows the 'Yes' side is approaching the 24-vote threshold. I would decrease my probability if influential figures publicly express doubt about reaching a consensus or if reports indicate the broader proposal is losing support.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the NFL ban the \"Tush-Push\" before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nESPN: [Vote on tush push ban tabled by NFL owners for more discussion](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/44490292/sources-tush-push-ban-vote-tabled-nfl-owners) | CBS Sports: [Expansive 'Tush Push' ban could have strong support at NFL's next owners meeting, per report](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/expansive-tush-push-ban-could-have-strong-support-at-nfls-next-owners-meeting-per-report/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the National Football League officially approves or announces a rule restricting the quarterback sneak known as the [Tush-Push](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarterback_sneak#Tush_push) before June 1, 2025. If there are no reports of this occurring before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe original proposal is being reworked into a broader rule that would prohibit pushing or pulling a ball carrier anywhere on the field, not just in the specific quarterback sneak formation. This change aims to frame the issue around general football principles rather than targeting a specific team.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
