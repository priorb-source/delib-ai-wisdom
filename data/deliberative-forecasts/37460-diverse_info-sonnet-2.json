    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis relies heavily on claims about 'hundreds of thousands' protesting over Ekrem İmamoğlu's arrest, but this information doesn't appear in my research report despite being supposedly recent (we're on May 7). This makes me skeptical of their data sources. Their 88% forecast seems overconfident.\n\nForecaster 3 raises the most critical insight: the question hinges not on whether large protests occur, but on whether the Global Protest Tracker REPORTS them. Their specific data about May 1 (65,000 participants per Governor's Office) is concrete, though my report only mentions 'arrests made ahead of the May 1st protests' without participant numbers. More importantly, Forecaster 3 correctly identifies that:\n1. The Tracker is selective and may not include routine annual events like May Day\n2. The question's launch date matters - if it launched after May 1, that event wouldn't qualify\n3. Reporting lags could mean even qualifying events aren't published by July 1\n\nThis shifts the analytical framework significantly. Rather than just assessing protest likelihood, I need to weight: (a) probability of qualifying events occurring, (b) probability the Tracker includes them, and (c) probability of timely reporting.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, my initial 28% forecast underweighted the possibility that a qualifying event may have already occurred (May 1). However, I cannot verify Forecaster 3's specific participant numbers, and the critical uncertainties they identify are substantial:\n\n1. **May 1 eligibility**: Unknown whether question launched before or after May 1. If after, this event is disqualified regardless of size.\n\n2. **Tracker selectivity**: Annual May Day marches occur in many countries. The Tracker tends to focus on distinct anti-government movements rather than routine labor demonstrations, even large ones. The fact that May 1 saw significant crackdowns increases likelihood of inclusion, but doesn't guarantee it.\n\n3. **Reporting timing**: Even if Carnegie decides to include May 1, publication could lag past July 1.\n\n4. **Future events**: The May 30 hearing and ongoing economic crisis provide potential catalysts for additional large protests before July 1, but government restrictions remain formidable.\n\nForecaster 3's reasoning about resolution mechanics is more sound than Forecaster 2's optimistic scenario. However, the combination of: (a) possible May 1 event already occurring, (b) ~55 days remaining for other events, and (c) severe economic conditions creating genuine grievances, suggests slightly higher probability than my initial forecast.\n\nI'm updating to 35% - higher than my original 28% to account for the May 1 possibility and remaining time window, but well below Forecaster 2's 88% given the substantial reporting uncertainties Forecaster 3 correctly identifies.",
