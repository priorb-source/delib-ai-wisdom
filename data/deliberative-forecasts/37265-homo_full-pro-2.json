    "review": "The deliberation revealed a strong consensus, with all three forecasters independently arriving at a 25% probability. We all identified the same core tension: the significant bureaucratic inertia of the State Department's advisory system, particularly over a short two-month timeframe, versus the credible and proximate security threats, primarily the risk of spillover from the insurgency in Mozambique. No new primary evidence was introduced. However, the other forecasters provided valuable framing. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the need for a \"high-profile event\" to alter the security assessment for the *entire country* was a particularly sharp articulation of why a country-wide upgrade has a high bar. Forecaster 2's point about the State Department's demonstrated willingness to issue Level 3 advisories for neighboring countries reinforces that such a change is possible if conditions are met, justifying a non-trivial probability.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 25%. The discussion with the other forecasters strengthened my conviction in my original assessment rather than challenging it. The consensus on the key drivers provides a strong signal that the forecast is well-calibrated. The central argument remains unchanged: the status quo is a powerful predictor over a short period of less than two months, and a country-wide advisory change is a significant step that usually requires a major catalyst. The current advisory already incorporates existing risks by assigning a specific Level 3 warning to the Mtwara region, suggesting the State Department may see its current guidance as sufficient. However, as all three of us noted, the situation on the Mozambique border is a tangible wild card. A single significant cross-border attack or a high-profile incident in a tourist area could plausibly trigger a rapid reassessment. Therefore, while a 'No' outcome is the most likely scenario, the 25% probability accurately reflects the real and present danger that could force the State Department's hand.",
