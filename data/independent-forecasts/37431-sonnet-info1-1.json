  "information": "The recall, issued on April 24, 2025, by ACC Central Kitchen LLC, is for approximately 64,000 to 65,000 pounds of frozen pork bun products. The recall is classified as Class I and was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared sesame allergen. The affected products were produced over an extended period, with some items dating back to November 2023. Distribution was limited to retail locations in New York. There have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption of these products.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 57 days remain until July 1, 2025, when the outcome will be determined.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall remains Active. The recall was just issued 11 days ago and would need to be officially closed within the remaining time frame for a Yes resolution.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall remains Active through July 1, 2025. The company continues working through the recall process, retrieving products from New York retail locations, but FSIS has not yet completed verification and changed the status to Closed by the deadline. This is typical given that most food recalls take 3-6 months or longer to officially close.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "ACC Central Kitchen LLC successfully completes the recall within the next 50 days, retrieving the affected frozen pork buns from retail locations in New York. FSIS conducts its verification process and updates the recall status to Closed before July 1, 2025. The limited geographic distribution and frozen nature of the product facilitate a faster-than-typical closure.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires weighing the typical timeline for food recall closures against specific favorable factors in this case. The status quo strongly favors a No outcome - the recall was issued only 11 days ago, and food recalls generally take 3-6 months or more to officially close as companies must retrieve products, verify completion, and await FSIS verification. However, several factors could accelerate this process: (1) Limited distribution to retail locations in New York only, rather than nationwide distribution, significantly reduces logistical complexity; (2) Frozen products are easier to identify, track, and remove from shelves than perishable items; (3) No reported illnesses reduces urgency but also complications; (4) The 68-day total window from issuance to deadline provides over 2 months, which while short for recalls, is not impossible. The Class I classification indicates seriousness but doesn't necessarily extend timelines. Historical patterns suggest most recalls take longer than 2 months to close, even straightforward ones, due to bureaucratic verification processes. The forecast is not higher because bureaucratic timelines are notoriously slow and predictable, and 68 days is compressed for a full recall cycle including FSIS verification. The forecast is not lower because the limited geographic scope is a genuinely significant accelerating factor - this isn't a nationwide recall requiring coordination across multiple states. For me to revise upward, I would need evidence that similar limited-scope recalls have closed faster than typical, or signs that this company is moving unusually quickly through the process. To revise downward, evidence that FSIS verification processes are delayed or that product retrieval is complicated would shift probabilities toward No.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by ACC Central Kitchen LLC of pork bun products issued April 24, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nConsumerAffairs: [Nearly 65,000 pounds of pork buns recalled for undeclared allergen](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/nearly-65000-pounds-of-pork-buns-recalled-for-undeclared-allergen-042525.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/acc-central-kitchen-llc-recalls-pork-bun-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe recall, issued on April 24, 2025, by ACC Central Kitchen LLC, is for approximately 64,000 to 65,000 pounds of frozen pork bun products. The recall is classified as Class I and was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared sesame allergen.

There have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption of these products.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
