    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base-rate view and timeline. Useful additions: (1) the explicit point that Berkshire passed on Alphabet/Meta when cheaper in 2022–23 (Forecaster 3) is a meaningful negative signal I hadn’t emphasized; (2) the nuance that liquidity in MAG7 reduces the need for confidential treatment (Forecaster 3) slightly weakens my earlier “they might be masking” argument, though Berkshire has used confidentiality even in large caps before; (3) the cash pile/Apple concentration as a diversifying nudge toward a large, high-quality tech name (Forecaster 2) is a small positive. Net, these new points cut both ways and mostly reinforce a low base rate without clear catalysts.",
    "rationale": "Time to resolution is about a week, with the status quo being no new MAG7 names disclosed. The strongest “Yes” pathway remains a lieutenant-sized initiation in Alphabet or Meta; Microsoft/Nvidia/Tesla stay unlikely given long-stated preferences and valuation/optics. Counterweights: Berkshire’s recent caution, elevated valuations, lack of hints at/around the annual meeting, and the historical fact they didn’t buy when some of these were cheaper. While confidentiality could mask a new stake (reducing the chance of a reported Yes this quarter), the point that MAG7 liquidity makes confidentiality less necessary slightly tempers that factor. The offsetting updates from the other forecasters net out, so I keep my estimate essentially unchanged.",
