    "review": "All three forecasters have reached a strong consensus on the core logic driving this question. We all agree that because the 31% tariff is already officially listed in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS), and the resolution date of June 1 falls within the 90-day suspension period (ending July 9), the status quo strongly favors a 'Yes' outcome. The unanimous key insight is that the resolution criteria explicitly render the 'suspended' status of the tariff irrelevant. The primary difference in our forecasts (ranging from 80% to 90%) lies in the weight we assign to the possibility of an active administrative or political intervention that would remove the listing from the HTS before the resolution date. Forecaster 2 raises valid possibilities for a 'No' outcome, such as a broader policy reversal, but I believe their 80% forecast gives too much weight to this scenario within such a short timeframe. Forecaster 3's analysis at 88% is very closely aligned with my own, adding useful nuance about specific risks like 'housekeeping changes' or legal action, which I agree are low-probability events.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 90%. My initial reasoning remains robust and has been reinforced by the deliberation. The crucial factors are the existing HTS listing and the resolution criteria, which effectively make the current state a 'Yes' outcome. The 90-day suspension period, which extends well past the June 1 resolution date, is a strong signal from the administration that the policy is 'parked' pending negotiations. It is procedurally simplest to leave the suspended tariff on the books until those negotiations conclude. For the outcome to be 'No', both a successful diplomatic breakthrough and a subsequent, swift bureaucratic action to update the HTS would need to occur in the next ~5 weeks, which is highly improbable. Forecaster 2's point that Swiss 'incomprehension' may signal difficult negotiations actually strengthens the case for 'Yes', as it makes a rapid agreement less likely. While I acknowledge the risks of a sudden policy reversal or administrative change highlighted by both forecasters, I believe a 10% probability for a 'No' outcome adequately accounts for these scenarios. The path of least resistance and greatest bureaucratic inertia points overwhelmingly to the 31% tariff, though suspended, remaining on the schedule on June 1, 2025.",
