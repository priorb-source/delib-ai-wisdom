    "review": "The other forecasters introduced several crucial pieces of evidence and lines of reasoning that I had not considered. Forecaster 2's introduction of the base rate – that only about 38% of billionaires in the 200-300 rank range are from the U.S. – is a compelling quantitative anchor that fundamentally reframes the problem. My initial analysis was too focused on short-term market dynamics and lacked this structural context. Forecaster 3 provided a critical data update: the #250 rank on May 29 was also a non-U.S. citizen (from Russia). This strengthens the 'No' status quo significantly, as it's not just a single data point from a month ago but a more current observation. Both forecasters correctly pointed out that my focus on a U.S. stock rally might be insufficient to overcome these structural headwinds, especially as positive global news (like the tariff delay) would likely lift asset prices for billionaires globally, not just in the U.S. Their reasoning is highly convincing, particularly the emphasis on the base rate as the most logical starting point for a forecast over such a short period.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am significantly revising my forecast downward. My initial 55% forecast was overly optimistic, placing too much weight on recent positive U.S. economic news while failing to account for more powerful structural factors. The key new information driving my change is the base rate: only 38% of billionaires in this specific stratum of the list are from the U.S. This alone suggests that the baseline probability should be well below 50%. Furthermore, the confirmation that the #250 spot was held by non-U.S. citizens on two recent dates (April 30 and May 29) provides a strong status quo anchor for a 'No' outcome. While the positive momentum in U.S. markets I initially identified still provides a credible path to a 'Yes' resolution, it is not a strong enough factor to overcome the unfavorable base rate and the observed status quo. The chance of U.S. outperformance in the next 33 days is real, but a forecast of 34% better reflects the overall balance of evidence. I have therefore moved my forecast from 55% down to 34%, aligning my view much more closely with the data-driven approach of the other forecasters.",
