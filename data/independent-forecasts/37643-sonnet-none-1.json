    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 48 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the objective remains marked as 'in progress' rather than 'complete'",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The PSLF program faces regulatory or administrative changes but is not fully terminated by July 1, 2025. Implementation is delayed by legal challenges, administrative complexity, or political resistance. The tracker maintainers determine that partial changes don't meet the threshold for marking the objective as 'complete.'",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration issues executive orders or regulatory changes that effectively terminate the PSLF program within the next 48 days. The announcement and official policy changes are deemed sufficient by the Keep_Track subreddit moderators to mark the objective as 'complete,' even if full implementation is ongoing.",
    "rationale": "With only 48 days until the resolution date, this is an extremely tight timeframe for a major policy change. The objective is currently marked 'in progress,' indicating some actions have been taken but termination has not been achieved. Terminating PSLF would affect hundreds of thousands of borrowers and represents a significant policy shift requiring either legislative action (highly unlikely in this timeframe) or aggressive executive/regulatory action (more feasible but likely to face legal challenges). The key uncertainty is twofold: (1) whether actual termination can occur in 48 days, and (2) what threshold the tracker maintainers use for marking something 'complete' - they might require full implementation or might accept official announcements of termination. Factors keeping my forecast low include the short timeframe, administrative complexity of unwinding an existing program, likely legal challenges, and the general principle that major policy changes move slowly. Factors preventing an even lower forecast include the 'in progress' designation suggesting momentum and the possibility that the tracker marks objectives 'complete' based on official policy announcements rather than full implementation. I would update higher if there were news of imminent executive actions or regulatory changes specifically targeting PSLF termination. I would update lower if I learned the tracker maintainers require full implementation rather than just official announcements, or if significant legal obstacles emerged.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
