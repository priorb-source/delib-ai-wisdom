    "review": "Both forecasters converge around 28-30%, notably higher than my initial 18%. They raise several compelling points I should weigh carefully. Forecaster 2 emphasizes the compressed 2-month timeframe creates urgency - 'any decision must come soon' - which is valid. Forecaster 3 makes an excellent distinction between preparation and actually announcing a date, noting 'political leaders often make threats they don't immediately execute' and that 'the gap between having a draft constitution and actually announcing a referendum date is substantial.' This latter point actually supports my lower forecast.\n\nBoth forecasters acknowledge the genuine escalation (constitutional draft, defiant parade, laws banning central authorities) more strongly than I did. However, they also both recognize the massive difference between current positioning and actually scheduling a vote. The convergence of two independent forecasters at 28-30% carries information I should consider - perhaps I'm underweighting the compressed timeframe and real possibility of a triggering event occurring within 60 days.\n\nKey insights from their analyses: (1) The timeframe is genuinely tight enough that quick action is possible, (2) The legislative groundwork is more complete than I weighted, (3) The Crimea precedent (2 weeks) shouldn't be dismissed, (4) But status quo bias and the gap between threats and execution remain powerful.\n\nThe strongest argument for updating higher is the time constraint combined with escalation momentum. The strongest argument for staying lower is Forecaster 3's point about the pattern of escalating rhetoric 'while stopping short of the final step' and the lack of a specific triggering event.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I'm updating my forecast upward from 18% to 25%. Here's why:\n\nI was likely too conservative in weighting status quo bias. Both forecasters correctly identify that with only 60 days remaining, the compressed timeframe creates real urgency. My original assessment underweighted how quickly referendums can be organized when political will exists (Crimea demonstrates this).\n\nHowever, I maintain that several factors keep the probability below 30%: (1) Forecaster 3's critical distinction between preparation and announcement remains valid - announcing an actual date is an enormous escalation that forces irreversible consequences; (2) Dodik's historical pattern shows more brinksmanship than follow-through; (3) No specific triggering event has yet materialized that would precipitate immediate action; (4) Strong US/EU opposition creates severe deterrents that haven't been tested yet.\n\nThe convergence of Forecasters 2 and 3 at 28-30% carries meaningful information about my potential underestimation. But their own analyses acknowledge the massive gap between current actions and actually announcing a date. My updated 25% reflects: greater acknowledgment of the compressed timeframe and genuine escalation, balanced against the pattern of threats not immediately materializing and the enormous consequences of actually scheduling a vote.\n\nI would update further toward 35-40% if: a triggering incident occurs, specific timeline statements emerge, or referendum logistics begin. I would update down toward 15% if: time passes without movement into late May, or diplomatic de-escalation begins.",
