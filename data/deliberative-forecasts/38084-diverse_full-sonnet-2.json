    "review": "Both forecasters provided thoughtful analyses that align closely with my reasoning. Forecaster 3 raised an important methodological point I underweighted: the U.S. Drought Monitor requires multiple indicators (precipitation deficits, soil moisture, streamflow, impacts) before adjusting classifications, and tends to be conservative about rapidly downgrading D1 status. This means even beneficial rainfall won't necessarily translate quickly into population count reductions within our one-month timeframe. Both forecasters also effectively emphasized how rare and unpredictable June tropical storm impacts are for California - while I noted this uncertainty, they correctly highlight that early-summer tropical moisture events rarely deliver the broad, heavy, multi-day rains needed to meaningfully reduce drought classifications across populous regions. Forecaster 3's explicit mention that week-to-week swings of 2-3M are possible but unlikely in the improving direction during California's dry season adds useful calibration. Their forecasts of 80% and 87% bracket mine at 78%, and I find their reasoning for being at those levels compelling.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I believe I initially gave too much weight to the tropical storm uncertainty and insufficient weight to USDM's methodological conservatism. The key insight is that drought classifications don't adjust quickly even with beneficial weather - multiple indicators must show sustained improvement. Given the 2.7M buffer above the threshold, California's climatologically dry late June period, NOAA's explicit forecasts for drought persistence through August, and USDM's cautious approach to reclassification, the barriers to a NO outcome are higher than I initially assessed. The tropical storm scenario, while representing real uncertainty, is both meteorologically unlikely for June and unlikely to produce the widespread, sustained rainfall that would trigger rapid USDM reclassification of populous areas within one month. The good news from earlier water storage reports (86% at Lake Oroville, 96% snowpack) provides some support for potential modest improvements, but these factors were already incorporated into the current 22.7M figure and don't change the near-term outlook substantially. I'm updating my forecast upward to better reflect these dynamics.",
