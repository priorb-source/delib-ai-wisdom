    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises a critical point I completely missed: they state recent 13Fs show Berkshire holding approximately 10.7M Amazon shares, while Forecaster 2 mentions the last filing showed exactly 10,000,000 shares. This fundamentally reframes the question. If current holdings are at or above 10M shares, then the status quo IS a Yes outcome - they would need to actively REDUCE their position below 10M for a No. I had mistakenly treated this as requiring an INCREASE to 10M+. Forecaster 3's logic about Berkshire's historical behavior is compelling: (1) the Amazon position has been stable for years, (2) when raising cash, they typically sell larger positions like Apple rather than smaller holdings, (3) the buy-and-hold approach creates strong inertia. However, there's uncertainty about the exact baseline (10M vs 10.7M matters significantly), and Berkshire's 10 straight quarters of net selling and record cash accumulation does increase the probability of broad-based trimming. Forecaster 2's 15% seems inconsistent with their own statement that the baseline is 10M shares.",
    "rationale": "I made a fundamental error in my initial analysis by not properly identifying the current holdings baseline. The question is whether Berkshire will MAINTAIN holdings above 10M, not whether they'll PURCHASE up to 10M. If current holdings are 10.0-10.7M shares as the other forecasters indicate, the status quo outcome is Yes. For a No outcome, Berkshire would need to actively reduce their Amazon stake by either (a) any amount if at exactly 10M, or (b) 6-7%+ if at 10.7M. Given Berkshire's historical behavior - stable Amazon position for years, tendency to sell larger positions when raising cash, and general buy-and-hold philosophy - a material reduction seems unlikely but not impossible. The 10 consecutive quarters of net selling and record cash levels provide some counterweight, but selling a relatively small position like Amazon (vs their massive Apple stake) would be an inefficient way to raise cash. The key uncertainty is the exact baseline: if they're at 10M exactly, even minimal selling triggers No; if at 10.7M, they have more buffer. Balancing the strong status quo bias against the ongoing selling trend and baseline uncertainty, I'm updating significantly upward but remaining more conservative than Forecaster 3's 90%.",
