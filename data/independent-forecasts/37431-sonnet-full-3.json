  "information": "The recall, issued on April 24, 2025, by ACC Central Kitchen LLC, is for approximately 64,000 to 65,000 pounds of frozen pork bun products. The recall is classified as Class I and was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared sesame allergen. The affected products were produced over an extended period, with some items dating back to November 2023. Distribution was limited to retail locations in New York. There have been no reported illnesses associated with the consumption of these products.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) oversees the recall process. For a recall to be formally closed, the FSIS must complete effectiveness checks and verify that the company has removed all affected products from commerce, notified customers, and implemented corrective actions. Historical data for similar recalls show varied timelines; medium-scale allergen recalls (10,000-100,000 lbs) typically take 60 to 120 days to close. Other analyses suggest a mean closure time of 45 days for allergen/misbranding recalls, with about half of comparable recalls in 2023-2024 closing within 70 days.\n\nSeveral factors specific to this recall may influence its duration. Factors that could lead to a longer resolution time include the substantial volume of the product, the long production window, and the product's frozen nature, which means it may remain in consumer freezers for longer periods. Conversely, factors that could shorten the timeline include the recall's limited geographical scope (only New York), the reason being a misbranding/allergen issue rather than pathogen contamination (which typically involves a more complex investigation), and the company's proactive and voluntary initiation of the recall.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "57 days from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall remains active past July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall remains active through July 1, 2025 because FSIS effectiveness checks take longer than 68 days to complete, frozen products remain in consumer freezers making verification difficult, or the long production window (November 2023 onwards) complicates the removal and tracking process.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recall is closed before July 1, 2025 because the limited geographic distribution (New York only) enables rapid product removal and verification, the allergen misbranding issue requires less complex investigation than pathogen contamination, and FSIS completes effectiveness checks within the 68-day window from recall issuance.",
    "rationale": "The recall was issued April 24, 2025, giving a 68-day window until the July 1 cutoff. This timeframe is right at the boundary of typical closure periods. Historical data shows allergen recalls average 45 days but medium-scale recalls (10,000-100,000 lbs) typically take 60-120 days, with about 50% closing within 70 days. Several factors favor faster closure: limited geographic scope (NY only), allergen/misbranding rather than pathogen issues, voluntary company action, and no reported illnesses. However, significant factors suggest slower closure: substantial volume (64,000+ lbs), very long production window (dating to November 2023), frozen products that persist in consumer freezers, and Class I classification. The 68-day window is tight given these characteristics. Status quo bias strongly applies here - after 11 days, the recall remains active with no indication of imminent closure. While the limited distribution helps, the frozen nature and production timeline create verification challenges. The probability should reflect that we're at approximately the 50th percentile of historical closure times but with specific factors skewing slightly negative. I'm not forecasting higher because 68 days is genuinely tight for this volume and product type, and frozen items create inherent delays. I'm not lower because the geographic limitation and allergen nature do provide meaningful advantages over more complex recalls.",
