    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recent trend of a slow, gradual decline in the rig count continues, driven by producer capital discipline and stable oil prices. The net rig count decreases by only a few units over the five-week period, remaining above the 583 threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A catalyst, such as a drop in oil prices below $75/bbl due to recession fears or a new wave of corporate mergers in the energy sector, accelerates the decline. This leads to a sharper-than-expected drop of 7 or more rigs, pushing the final count below 583.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an extrapolation of the prevailing trends in the U.S. shale industry into the near future. The dominant factor since 2023 has been producer capital discipline, prioritizing shareholder returns over aggressive production growth. This has resulted in a steady but slowing decline in the active rig count, as companies focus on drilling efficiency to maintain output with fewer rigs.\n\nFirst, I established a baseline for the hypothetical start date of April 23, 2025. Given the trend of a slow decline of approximately 2-3 rigs per month observed through late 2023 and early 2024, I project the starting rig count to be approximately 589. The question asks if the count will be less than 583 by May 30, 2025, which requires a net decline of at least 7 rigs over the subsequent five weeks.\n\nThe status quo scenario, which I weight most heavily, involves this slow decline continuing. A reduction of 2-3 rigs per month equates to an expected drop of about 3-4 rigs over a five-week period. This would place the final count around 585-586, which is a 'No' outcome.\n\nMy probability of 35% is not lower because the rig count data is volatile week-to-week, and the overall trend is still downward. A few consecutive weeks of larger-than-average declines—a perfectly plausible scenario—could be sufficient to push the count below the 583 threshold. A drop in oil prices from their current levels, which is a significant possibility given global economic uncertainty, would also accelerate this decline.\n\nConversely, my probability is not higher because for a 'Yes' outcome to occur, the rate of decline must accelerate beyond the recent trend. The current futures market for oil does not suggest a price collapse that would force such a rapid reduction. Furthermore, for the trend to reverse and the rig count to increase, a significant and sustained oil price rally (e.g., WTI >$95/bbl) would be required, which seems less likely than the continuation of the current trend. Thus, the most probable outcome is that the rig count declines, but not quickly enough to fall below the specified threshold.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of active US drilling rigs be less than 583 for the week ending May 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSeekingAlpha: [U.S. rig count falls for third straight week, Baker Hughes says](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4430543-u-s-rig-count-falls-for-third-straight-week-baker-hughes-says)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the last count of active US drilling rigs for the week ending May 30, 2025, according to the [Baker Hughes North America Rig Count](https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/na-rig-count), is less than 583. Specifically, it will resolve based on the number listed as the United States Total for the most recent week in the May 30, 2025 North America Rig Count Report. This is the number of active drilling rigs and includes the total of those classified as gas, oil and miscellaneous, in every US location including inland waters, land and offshore.\n\nIf no report dated May 30, 2025, is released before June 1, 2025, Eastern Time, Metaculus may resolve this question using the most recent report available dated between May 23, 2025, and June 1, 2025, inclusive. If no such report exists, this question will be annulled.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
