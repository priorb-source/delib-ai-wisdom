  "information": "On April 29, 2025, Egypt's Minister of Youth and Sports, Dr. Ashraf Sobhy, met with Gilberto Gartner, a Brazilian national who is the President of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss Egypt's bid to host the 2026 World Traditional Karate Championship. Dr. Sobhy stated that Egypt has organized over 440 sports events in recent years, citing its modern sports infrastructure. President Gartner expressed confidence in Egypt's ability to host the championship successfully, noting he had witnessed a high level of organization at the World Gymnastics Championship in Egypt and that the country has a large base of karate practitioners.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "53 days remaining until July 1, 2025 deadline",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement has been made. If nothing changes, the question resolves as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ITKF delays their decision past the July 1, 2025 deadline, chooses a different host country for the 2026 championship, or continues deliberations without making a formal announcement within the timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the positive April 29th meeting, the ITKF completes its evaluation process and announces within the next 53 days that Egypt has been selected to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship.",
    "rationale": "The recent high-level meeting on April 29, 2025 (just 9 days ago) between Egypt's Sports Minister and ITKF President Gartner is a strong positive signal. The ITKF President's expressed confidence in Egypt's capabilities and reference to witnessing Egypt's organizational success at the World Gymnastics Championship suggests genuine consideration. Egypt's track record of hosting 440+ sports events and large karate practitioner base strengthen their bid. However, several uncertainties temper confidence: (1) No announcement has been made despite the recent meeting, (2) We lack information about competing bids from other countries, (3) International sports federations typically have deliberative processes that can extend beyond anticipated timelines, (4) While 53 days provides reasonable time for a decision, it's not guaranteed the ITKF will move this quickly. The status quo outcome is No, and most predictions that haven't materialized yet don't materialize. For my forecast to move higher, I would need evidence of: formal bid submission deadlines approaching, statements indicating imminent decision, or absence of competing bids. For it to move lower, I would need: news of strong competing bids, procedural delays, or cooling enthusiasm from ITKF. Balancing the encouraging recent meeting against status quo bias and timing uncertainties, I estimate moderate probability.",
