    "review": "Both forecasters align with my core view: short horizon and strong bureaucratic inertia make continuity very likely. They added a helpful nuance: because resolution is “on or after” July 1, transient downtime risk is smaller than I initially weighted. They also stress ambiguity about whether a 301/302 redirect would count, which I already flagged as a key residual risk. No new concrete evidence (e.g., signs of a CMS migration) was presented.",
    "rationale": "My prior centered on institutional and URL stability at travel.state.gov and the statutory nature of the DV program. The short time window further reduces policy and reorg risk. Incorporating the others’ points: I downweight transient-outage risk slightly (given “on or after” language) but keep a meaningful tail for a URL/slug change or a redirect that Metaculus might judge as not being “at this location.” With no fresh signals of a site migration or DV policy change, my overall probability remains essentially the same.",
