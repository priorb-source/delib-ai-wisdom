    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall page currently shows Active; if nothing changes, it will still be Active on July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS keeps the recall Active past July 1 due to ongoing effectiveness checks, difficulty verifying product disposition across distributors/foodservice, an expansion of the recall, or simple administrative delay in updating the FSIS page.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cargill completes recall effectiveness checks and accounting for product distribution; FSIS verifies and updates the recall’s status from Active to Closed before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Framing and base rates: FSIS recall statuses typically move from Active to Closed once effectiveness checks and product disposition are verified. Many meat/poultry/egg recalls close in roughly 1–4 months; three months (by July 1) is a plausible window. This recall began March 28, so July 1 is about 95 days later, which is near the midpoint of common closure timelines.\n- Case specifics: The issue is an unapproved/cleaning-solution substance in liquid eggs, likely a Class II/III-type hazard rather than a pathogen outbreak. A large, experienced firm (Cargill) generally executes recalls efficiently, which supports closure within a few months. Distribution to foodservice can complicate accounting, but big suppliers often have traceability to complete effectiveness checks in time.\n- Status quo weighting: As of now, the page is Active. If nothing changes, the outcome is No. I assign extra weight to this, since government page updates sometimes lag even after operational closure. That tempers the probability.\n- Why not higher: Unknown current FSIS progress; potential for administrative lag or a recall expansion could keep it Active. Government web updates don’t always align quickly with operational reality.\n- Why not lower: Three months is a common closure timeframe, and the hazard nature plus Cargill’s capacity argue for timely resolution. There’s no indication of illnesses or complex ongoing investigation that would systematically extend timelines.\n- What would move me up: Evidence of similar FSIS egg-product recalls closing in ~60–90 days; any FSIS update or Cargill notice indicating effectiveness checks completed; absence of any expansion over the next few weeks.\n- What would move me down: A recall expansion/additional distribution lists; reports of investigation complications; prolonged lack of updates into late June; or signs of FSIS backlog affecting status updates.\n- Research assistant info: None beyond the prompt; no new data found, so I rely on process knowledge and typical timelines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by Cargill Kitchen Solutions of its liquid egg product for an unapproved substance issued March 28, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nABC News: [Liquid eggs recalled due to potential cleaning solution contamination](https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Food/liquid-eggs-recalled-due-potential-cleaning-solution-contamination/story?id=120329600)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/cargill-kitchen-solutions-recalls-liquid-egg-products-due-unapproved-substance) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
