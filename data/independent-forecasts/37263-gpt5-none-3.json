    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Uber is not available in Turks and Caicos",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Regulators maintain crackdown on unlicensed/ride-hail services, no agreement with Uber, and Uber’s website continues to show no availability for Turks and Caicos by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Uber secures government approval or launches a compliant private-hire model, begins driver onboarding, local media reports availability, and Uber lists Turks and Caicos on its website before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The baseline is that Uber is not currently available in Turks and Caicos. The cited April 2025 article warning stakeholders about “illegal taxis” signals an enforcement-oriented, protectionist stance toward the existing taxi market, which historically correlates with resistance to Uber’s entry in small island economies. Turks and Caicos is a small, highly touristic market with strong taxi interests and a track record of regulating against informal ride services. Launching within ~2 months would require regulatory accommodation, public driver recruitment, and app listing—none of which have surfaced as public signals. In comparable Caribbean markets, Uber’s presence is mixed and often contentious; while it operates in some areas (e.g., Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, parts of Jamaica), other islands have kept it out or constrained it. That leaves a non-zero chance: Uber could replicate a “charter/private hire” workaround or strike a late-breaking deal, and high tourist demand could motivate a fast-track. But given the short runway, lack of current signals, and recent crackdown framing, the probability remains low. Research assistant had no additional info, reinforcing the absence of positive signals. Not higher because of regulatory headwinds, small-market economics, and timing. Not lower because Uber has executed rapid launches in the region before and a policy pivot is possible. I would update upward on any of: Uber driver recruitment in TCI, official government statements permitting ride-hail, credible local media reporting a pending launch, or Uber’s help/landing pages listing TCI. I would update downward on explicit government bans, continued enforcement bulletins naming ride-hail, or union/government statements ruling out Uber this season.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Uber be available in the Turks and Caicos Islands on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Tourism Stakeholders Warned About Encouraging Use of Illegal Taxis](https://magneticmediatv.com/2025/04/tourism-stakeholders-warned-about-encouraging-use-of-illegal-taxis/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Uber is available in Turks and Caicos as shown on the [Uber website](https://www.uber.com/us/en/search-results/?query=TURKS+AND+CAICOS) or according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
