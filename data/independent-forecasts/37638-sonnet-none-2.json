    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Texas does not currently have a complete ban on THC sales, and maintaining the status quo would mean this question resolves as No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Texas legislative session ends in late May 2025 without passing a comprehensive THC ban, or a bill fails to gain sufficient support in either chamber, or the Governor does not sign such legislation before July 1, 2025. The status quo of allowing certain hemp-derived THC products continues.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A senate bill banning THC sales passes both the Texas Senate and House in the remaining days of the legislative session, and Governor Abbott signs it into law before July 1, 2025. The bill would need to prohibit all THC sales statewide, not just partial restrictions.",
    "rationale": "With only 6.5 weeks until the resolution date and the Texas legislative regular session typically ending in late May, time is extremely limited for passage of major legislation. The Beaumont Enterprise article title poses a question rather than reporting passage, suggesting uncertainty about whether such a ban will succeed. The status quo strongly favors a No outcome - Texas currently allows certain THC products under hemp regulations, and comprehensive bans represent significant policy shifts that typically face opposition from various stakeholders including the hemp industry, medical marijuana advocates, and libertarian-leaning legislators. Without specific information about bill progress, committee assignments, vote counts, or timeline, I must weight the base rate heavily. Most proposed legislation does not pass, especially contentious social policy changes late in a session. For this forecast to be higher, I would need evidence that: a bill has passed at least one chamber, has strong bipartisan support, the Governor has indicated willingness to sign, and sufficient time remains in the legislative calendar. For it to be lower, I would need confirmation the session has ended without passage or that no serious bill has been filed. The 12% probability reflects some non-trivial chance given the article suggests active legislative discussion, but heavily weights the status quo given the tight timeline and lack of concrete progress indicators.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the state of Texas ban THC before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBeaumont Enterprise: [Will THC see its final death blow in Texas this session?](https://www.beaumontenterprise.com/news/article/texas-senate-bill-aims-ban-thc-activists-call-20279801.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, Texas enacts a law prohibiting the sale of THC. If no new prohibitions on the sale of THC become law in Texas before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nFor it to count, a law must fully prohibit the sale of THC within the state. This question resolves upon a ban being signed into law, rather than when it is implemented. An enacted law being later overturned will not cause the question to re-resolve. Partial bans (for example laws prohibiting the sale of THC to persons under 21 years of age) will not count. This question pertains to the sale of THC within the state, not to the purchase of it by individuals.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
