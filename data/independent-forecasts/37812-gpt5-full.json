  "information": "Several airlines announced the resumption or launch of new flights to Beirut for the summer 2025 season. Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) is resuming service from Copenhagen and Stockholm in June. Emirates resumed its daily service from Dubai in February 2025 and added a second daily flight in April. Air France and its subsidiary Transavia also resumed flights from Paris in February. Other confirmed additions include a Wizz Air flight from Abu Dhabi starting June 4, a seasonal Middle East Airlines (MEA) route to Barcelona from June 26, and a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw beginning July 1, 2025.\n\nAccording to airport statistics, Beirut International Airport handled 1,254,550 passengers in the first quarter of 2025, a 1.42% decrease from the same period in 2024. While passenger arrivals increased by 9.33%, departures fell by 11.60%, and the number of transit passengers dropped by over 92%. The Lebanese government has also implemented new security measures at the airport to combat smuggling, including banning certain Iranian flights and increasing security checks.\n\nAs of May 2025, the number of active destinations was estimated to be around 39, based on OAG schedule data, down from 53 in May 2024. A number of airlines that suspended routes in October 2023, including British Airways, Lufthansa Group, Saudia, EgyptAir, and Pegasus, had not fully returned. Key Gulf carriers like Kuwait Airways and Qatar Airways also remained absent. Lebanon’s tourism ministry has projected that summer arrivals for 2025 will be 30% below 2019 levels.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 41 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By July 1, FlightsFrom shows roughly mid-40s destinations: a handful of announced summer resumptions (e.g., Copenhagen, Stockholm, Abu Dhabi, Barcelona, Warsaw) are added to the ~39 currently active, but major holdouts (Qatar Airways, Kuwait Airways, Saudia, EgyptAir, Pegasus, BA, Lufthansa Group) remain absent. The count stays well below 52.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Multiple previously suspended carriers rapidly reinstate service before July (e.g., Qatar to Doha, Kuwait Airways to Kuwait City, Saudia to several Saudi cities, EgyptAir to Cairo, Pegasus to Istanbul SAW, and at least one of BA/Lufthansa Group to LHR/FRA/ZRH/VIE). Combined with already announced additions, the total listed on FlightsFrom reaches 52+ by July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline and current data: The research assistant estimates ~39 active destinations as of May 2025 (OAG), down from 53 in May 2024. That is a large year-over-year drop. FlightsFrom’s methodology should track broadly with OAG schedules, so starting from ~39 is a reasonable proxy.\n- Known adds before/around July 1: SAS (CPH, ARN), Wizz Abu Dhabi (AUH, Jun 4), MEA seasonal Barcelona (Jun 26), LOT Warsaw (Jul 1). Air France/Transavia Paris resumptions were already in place by Feb and likely already counted. These announced changes plausibly lift the count into the low-to-mid 40s by July 1.\n- Missing pillars: Several high-frequency, multi-destination carriers remain absent (Qatar Airways, Kuwait Airways, Saudia to multiple KSA cities, EgyptAir, Pegasus), plus BA and the Lufthansa Group (FRA/ZRH/VIE). Without the Gulf and European network carriers, adding 8–10+ destinations in the next six weeks is unlikely.\n- Demand and risk backdrop: Q1 2025 traffic dipped slightly YoY; departures fell 11.6%, and transit passengers plunged. Lebanon’s tourism ministry expects summer arrivals ~30% below 2019. Security measures and bans on some Iranian flights reduce potential destinations. Regional security remains fragile, and headlines suggest a weak summer season for Lebanon’s tourism. Carriers generally require longer lead times to restart routes in such an environment.\n- Status quo weight: Last May there were ~53; this May is ~39, implying a structurally weaker network. The world tends to change slowly; a swift rebound back above 51 by July would require multiple coordinated airline returns that we do not yet see in schedules.\n- Why not higher: To clear 51, BEY needs roughly 8–10 more destinations beyond the already announced adds. That would require several of the currently absent carriers to resume imminently—low probability given security, demand, and lead-time constraints.\n- Why not lower: Some seasonal and opportunistic additions are happening (SAS, Wizz AUH, MEA BCN, LOT WAW), and others could trickle in. FlightsFrom might list all scheduled summer destinations, which could be a tad higher than an “active today” snapshot.\n- What would move me up: Verified schedule postings on FlightsFrom/OAG for multiple absent carriers (especially Qatar DOH, Kuwait KWI, Saudia JED/RUH/DMM, EgyptAir CAI, Pegasus SAW) or returns of BA/Lufthansa Group before late June, adding 8–10+ distinct airports.\n- What would move me down: Any new cancellations or security escalations prompting further suspensions; evidence that some of the announced resumptions are delayed/cancelled; or FlightsFrom showing fewer than ~42–44 in late June.\nTaking all this together, a Yes requires a fast, broad-based rebound that appears unlikely on the current timeline.",
