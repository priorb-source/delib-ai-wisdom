  "information": "A novel bat coronavirus, HKU5-CoV-2, has been identified and is part of the Merbecovirus family, which includes the MERS virus. Research published in the journal 'Cell' confirms that the virus can bind to human ACE2 receptors and infect human airway and organoid cultures in laboratory settings. However, studies also indicate that its cell-entry efficiency is significantly lower than that of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAs of May 16, 2025, no human cases of HKU5-CoV-2 have been reported by any major global health organizations, including the WHO, US CDC, ProMED, or GISAID. Post-COVID surveillance systems are in place in several countries, including China, Korea, and the U.S., which involve routine metagenomic sequencing of severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) cases. To date, these surveillance efforts have not detected any signals of HKU5-CoV-2 in human populations.\n\nHistorically, of the approximately 50 novel bat coronaviruses described in scientific literature since 2000, only SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have produced confirmed human cases within a year of their first description. The rate of publicly reported accidental laboratory infections for such viruses is also low, estimated at approximately one per decade worldwide.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of May 16, 2025, there have been no reported human cases of HKU5-CoV-2.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Global infectious disease surveillance systems, including routine sequencing of severe respiratory infections, continue to operate without detecting any human cases of HKU5-CoV-2. The virus fails to make a successful zoonotic jump from its bat reservoir to a human host, or any such jump results in an asymptomatic or non-transmissible case that goes undetected. No laboratory containment breaches occur. Consequently, no credible health organization reports a human case by the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A human case is identified and reported by a major health organization like the WHO or CDC. This could occur through one of two primary pathways: 1) A natural spillover event where an individual in close contact with the bat reservoir (e.g., a farmer, researcher, or caver) becomes infected, develops symptoms, and the pathogen is identified through advanced diagnostics. 2) An accidental laboratory exposure at one of the facilities studying the virus leads to an infection, which is then reported.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo, which is the absence of any reported human cases of HKU5-CoV-2. The primary factors supporting a low probability are the extremely short timeframe of ~1.5 months and the lack of any current signals. The research report indicates that extensive surveillance systems, enhanced post-COVID, have not detected this virus in human populations. This is strong evidence that there is no ongoing, undetected circulation. Furthermore, while HKU5-CoV-2 can infect human cells in vitro, its cell-entry efficiency is reportedly much lower than SARS-CoV-2, reducing the likelihood of a successful infection even if exposure occurs. History also suggests such events are rare; of approximately 50 novel bat coronaviruses described since 2000, only two led to confirmed human cases within a year of their description. My forecast is not lower than 2% because the risk is not zero. The virus belongs to the dangerous Merbecovirus family (which includes MERS), and it has demonstrated the fundamental biological capability to infect human cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor. The possibility of a rare, stochastic event—either a natural spillover or a laboratory accident (estimated at a background rate of roughly one per decade for all such viruses)—prevents a near-zero forecast. My forecast is not higher than 2% because doing so would require disregarding the strong evidence from current surveillance and the short time remaining. A higher probability would imply an imminent, tangible threat that is simply not supported by the provided information. I would increase my forecast upon news of unexplained severe respiratory clusters in relevant geographic areas or any official communication from health bodies about a potential Merbecovirus of unknown origin. Conversely, I would decrease my forecast as the deadline approaches without any such signals.",
