    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my process view: sub‑two months is tight without explicit fast‑tracking; the executive’s tax reform agenda provides a plausible vehicle; and clause‑level risk (removal/watering down) is non‑trivial. Forecaster 3 added two useful nuances I hadn’t emphasized: likely Sallah recess days in June and the recurring pattern of major tax changes bunching into year‑end Finance Acts. Forecaster 2 highlighted the last‑mile risk of presidential assent slipping past July 1 even if passage occurs late June. None provided evidence of concrete legislative progress since the late‑April reporting, which keeps the default biased to No. Overall, their reasoning is convincing and nudges me slightly down due to calendar compression and assent‑timing risk.",
    "rationale": "About 57 days remain. For a Yes, a credible path is: committee work and clean report by mid‑May; one chamber passage by late May; the other chamber and harmonization in early/mid‑June; transmission and presidential assent by late June. This is doable only if leadership prioritizes it. Positives: alignment with Tinubu’s housing affordability/tax reform agenda; an existing bill vehicle; the Assembly’s capacity to fast‑track priority executive bills. Negatives: VAT revenue sensitivity could spur resistance or pruning of the exemption; omnibus bundling risks slipping to later in the year; June Sallah recess likely reduces sitting days; and even small delays can push assent past July 1. Given no public signs (yet) of accelerated movement—e.g., completed readings, committee reports scheduled—status quo remains No by the deadline. I slightly reduce my odds to account for the June calendar and assent timing risks identified by the other forecasters. I would move up on evidence of expedited scheduling (second/third readings, committee report dates), passage in one chamber with the exemption intact, or leadership commitments to June passage. I would move down on reports of deferral to a later Finance/Appropriation cycle, fiscal pushback on VAT base erosion, or slippage past early June without chamber passage.",
