    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 put substantial weight on the base rate that once a meeting is scheduled, it occurs as planned. I agree with that conditional framing, but the key uncertainty here is whether June 12 is actually the scheduled date. Both acknowledge the lack of explicit confirmation but, in my view, underweight the significance of no DEF 14A as of May 27. For a large public company, having no definitive proxy two weeks out is a strong signal that June 12 is unlikely. The Notice-and-Access 40-day requirement is already blown; while full-set mailing with Delaware’s 10-day minimum notice is legally possible, it would be atypical and logistically tight for a company of GameStop’s profile. They also do not fully price the added “completion” risk: even if June 12 were set, GameStop’s 2024 adjournment and the potential for outsized retail interest increase the chance of an adjournment, which would resolve this question as No. The conflicting aggregator dates (Computershare June 2 vs. Bloomberg/BI June 12, with BI containing an error) further reduce confidence that June 12 is official. I find their reliance on historical cadence (Thursday in early/mid-June) reasonable as a prior, but without a DEF 14A, that prior should be heavily discounted.",
    "rationale": "Time until June 12 is ~16 days. There is no DEF 14A on file as of May 27, and Notice-and-Access timing is no longer feasible for a June 12 meeting. While Delaware law permits as little as 10 days’ notice with full-set mailing, using that minimum would be unusual and operationally tight, especially given broker processing and record date setting (also minimum 10 days). The data source conflict (Computershare June 2; Bloomberg/BI June 12 with an error on BI) suggests that third-party listings are not reliable evidence of a firm date. Even if June 12 were imminently announced, the 2024 experience (server failure and adjournment) and elevated retail interest imply a non-trivial adjournment risk, and per the resolution criteria, adjournment means No. These considerations keep my probability low. I would update up materially only upon a DEF 14A or official IR/TA communication explicitly setting June 12 with clear logistical details; if filed this week, I’d move into the ~50–60% range before accounting for adjournment risk, netting perhaps ~45–50%. If there’s still no DEF 14A by June 1, I’d move down toward 5–10%.",
