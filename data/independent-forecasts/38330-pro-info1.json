  "information": "A trend of 'reverse purchasing' has emerged where foreign tourists, particularly from the US, travel to China to purchase goods. According to Alipay data from the first half of April 2025, spending by foreign tourists in China increased 1.5 times compared to the same period in the previous year, with spending by US users doubling. This trend is attributed to improvements in China's manufacturing quality and favorable policies such as 'departure tax refund' and 'buy and refund' services. The changing international trade environment, including US tariffs, has also been cited as a contributing factor.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days. The resolution window is between June 10, 2025, and July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The term 'reverse purchasing' is a recent term, primarily used in Chinese media, and has not yet been adopted by major US publications like The New York Times. The baseline assumption is that this will not change in the next three weeks.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The story about 'reverse purchasing' fails to gain traction among New York Times reporters or editors, or it is deemed not sufficiently significant for coverage amidst a busy news cycle. Alternatively, the NYT may cover the trend of Americans shopping in China but opt to use different language to describe it (e.g., 'US shopping tourism in China'), thus not using the specific search terms required for a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A New York Times journalist, likely covering business or international affairs, picks up on the trend, possibly citing the Alipay data on increased spending by US tourists. They write an article exploring this phenomenon as an unexpected consequence of US tariffs and the shifting perception of Chinese goods, and use the specific term 'reverse purchasing' or 'reverse purchase' to label it. The article is published within the specified late-June timeframe.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the balance between a compelling, newsworthy trend and the high bar for a new, foreign-language-origin term to be adopted by a major publication within a very short timeframe. The status quo is 'No,' as the term is not currently in the NYT's lexicon. The world changes slowly, and journalistic language is often resistant to rapid adoption of new buzzwords. The primary factor against a 'Yes' is the brief 21-day window (June 10-30) for a story to be researched, written, edited, and published. However, the information from my research assistant provides strong arguments for a 'Yes' outcome. The data points, particularly the doubling of spending by US users on Alipay, create a strong hook. The connection to US tariffs gives the story a geopolitical angle that is squarely in the NYT's area of interest. This is not just a consumer trend story; it's a story about US-China economic relations. My probability is not lower than 20% because the story ingredients are potent and directly relevant to a US audience, making it more likely to be picked up than a generic trend. My probability is not higher than 20% because of the significant friction involved: the short timeline and the strong possibility that journalists will describe the phenomenon without adopting the specific 'reverse purchasing' terminology. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see other major Western financial news outlets like Bloomberg or the Wall Street Journal begin using the term. For me to decrease it, the news cycle would need to become saturated with a major breaking story that would sideline a feature like this.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the New York Times mention \"reverse purchasing\" before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPeople's Daily: [“Reverse purchasing” reflects the vitality of the Chinese market](http://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2025/0430/c1004-40471159.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the NY Times mentions \"reverse purchasing\" in any of its content items as found through [this search](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchasing%22&sort=best), dated after June 9, 2025 and before July 1, 2025. This question will also count \"reverse purchase,\" which can be found through [this link](https://www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false&lang=en&query=%22reverse%20purchase%22&sort=best).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA trend of 'reverse purchasing' has emerged where foreign tourists, particularly from the US, travel to China to purchase goods.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
