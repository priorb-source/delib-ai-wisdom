  "information": "According to data from Drought.gov on May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents, representing 73.9% of the state's population, were in drought-affected areas. Reports from late April 2025 indicated that 84% of the state was classified under moderate to extreme drought conditions, a severity level not seen since April 2012. The state has recorded its 12th driest April-to-March period since 1895, and some regions are 6-10 inches below their average rainfall since mid-October 2024.\n\nThe drought has caused significant ecological and public safety consequences. The Everglades is experiencing its worst drought in 13 years, causing some areas to dry up completely, which has led to the suspension of tourism activities like airboat tours. As of early May 2025, elevated fire risk resulted in over 100 active wildfires burning more than 3,600 acres of vegetation. In response to the dry conditions, at least 21 counties have issued burn bans.\n\nThe forecast period coincides with the start of Florida's typical rainy season on June 1, which is also the official start of the Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecast a 60% chance of an above-average 2025 hurricane season, with 13-19 named tropical storms expected. This is attributed to factors like warmer ocean temperatures and low wind shear. However, a separate NOAA forecast from March 2025 also predicted that drought conditions in South Florida would likely persist from April through June.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1 month",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, as of May 29, 2025, 14.5 million residents are in drought, which is above the 14.0 million threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 2025 Florida rainy season, which begins on June 1, starts with unusually strong and widespread precipitation. An early-season tropical disturbance or storm system delivers significant, soaking rain across large portions of the state, rapidly replenishing soil moisture and water levels, causing the number of affected residents to drop below 14.0 million by the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Florida's rainy season has a slow or patchy start in June 2025. Rainfall is localized and insufficient to overcome the significant precipitation deficits accumulated over the preceding months. While some areas see improvement, large population centers remain in drought, keeping the total number of affected residents at or above 14.0 million on June 28.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the balance between the severe current drought conditions and the potential for relief from the imminent rainy season. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the status quo. As of May 29, 2025, 14.5 million residents are in drought, exceeding the 14.0 million threshold. This drought is historically severe, described as the worst in over a decade, with significant rainfall deficits. Such conditions are not typically reversed quickly. Furthermore, a NOAA forecast from March 2025 explicitly predicted that drought conditions in South Florida would likely persist through June, lending strong support to this view. However, the primary factor driving uncertainty and arguing for a 'No' outcome is the timing. The resolution date of June 28 is one month into Florida's rainy season and the Atlantic hurricane season. The potential for one or more significant, widespread rain events during June is substantial. NOAA has predicted an above-average hurricane season, which could increase the chances of an early tropical system impacting the state. My probability is not higher than 65% because the current number (14.5M) is relatively close to the threshold (14.0M), meaning a moderate improvement in conditions affecting just over 500,000 people could flip the result. The onset of the rainy season represents a significant system-state change that could bring about this improvement. My probability is not lower than 65% because reversing a major drought requires sustained, widespread rainfall, not just isolated storms. Given the severity and the specific NOAA forecast for persistence, it is more likely than not that drought conditions for at least 14.0 million residents will linger through the first month of the wet season. I would update my forecast towards 'No' if a significant tropical system is forecast to bring widespread rain to Florida in early-to-mid June. I would update towards 'Yes' if the first few weeks of June are characterized by below-average or highly localized rainfall.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to data from Drought.gov on May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents, representing 73.9% of the state's population, were in drought-affected areas.
