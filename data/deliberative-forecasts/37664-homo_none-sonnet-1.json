    "review": "Both forecasters present compelling analyses that converge on substantially lower probabilities than my initial 18%. Forecaster 3 raises a particularly important point I overlooked: Anthropic's recent release pattern includes incremental updates like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, suggesting they may be following a different versioning strategy rather than jumping directly to Claude 4. This pattern evidence weakens the case for an imminent major version release. Both forecasters also appropriately emphasize that the complete absence of signals this close to the deadline is more damning than I initially weighted. With major AI releases, even surprise announcements typically have some advance infrastructure changes, documentation updates, or detectable preparation activities. The fact that my research assistant found literally nothing is strong negative evidence. All three of us identified similar reasoning patterns, but I may have been too generous in accounting for surprise launches - the base rate for completely unheralded flagship model releases in this industry is genuinely very low.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should update my forecast downward for three key reasons. First, the Claude 3.5 release pattern suggests Anthropic may delay Claude 4 or skip it in favor of continued incremental improvements, making a June 2025 launch less plausible. Second, the complete absence of any public signals - no leaks, no API changes, no beta programs - is extraordinarily strong evidence against a launch within 46 days, stronger than I initially credited. Third, two independent forecasters using sound reasoning arrived at significantly lower estimates (8% and 12%), suggesting my initial 18% may have been too optimistic about surprise launch scenarios. However, I don't want to go as low as 8% because the 14-month gap since Claude 3 remains within typical AI release cadence, and we cannot completely rule out accelerated internal timelines or strategic decisions to launch without advance marketing. A forecast around 11% appropriately balances the very strong negative evidence with the non-zero possibility of developments we haven't detected.",
