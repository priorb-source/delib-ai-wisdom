    "review": "The convergence on 87% across all three forecasters is striking and noteworthy. We've all independently identified the same key evidence: the strong historical trend (June 2020-2022 all exceeded 400), the robust 2025 pattern (every month Jan-Apr exceeded 400 with a 517 average), and the 28+ consecutive months above the threshold. Forecaster 2 adds useful quantitative framing - the 400 threshold is 23% below the current 2025 average, and falling short would require a 100+ report decline. This reinforces how far below recent trends the threshold sits. All three analyses correctly identify why we shouldn't be at 95%+ (behavioral uncertainty, potential technical issues, forecasting before June begins) and why we shouldn't be lower (overwhelming evidence, comfortable margins, no signs of decline). The perfect convergence could indicate either strong consensus around well-calibrated reasoning or potential groupthink, but given that these are independent analyses of straightforward quantitative data with a clear trend, I lean toward the former. No one raised evidence I hadn't considered in substance, though Forecaster 2's quantification of the margin (23% below average) is a helpful framing. The main uncertainty remains: we don't yet have May 2025 data, and unexpected systemic issues could theoretically occur.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasters' analyses, I find no compelling reason to update my forecast. The convergence at 87% reflects that we're all analyzing the same strong quantitative evidence: (1) a multi-year upward trend in reporting, (2) exceptional consistency in 2025 with four consecutive months exceeding 400 by comfortable margins, (3) a monthly average of 517 that provides substantial buffer above the 400 threshold. The factors that prevent higher confidence (pre-June timing uncertainty, small technical/systemic risk) remain valid, as do the factors preventing lower confidence (overwhelming trend evidence, large safety margin). The 87% forecast appropriately balances high confidence in the trend continuation against inherent uncertainty in behavioral forecasting and the small possibility of unexpected disruption. If May 2025 data becomes available showing continued strong performance (500+ reports), I would update to ~90%. If May shows an unexpected drop below 450, I would update down to ~80-82%. Without new information contradicting the established trend, 87% remains well-calibrated.",
