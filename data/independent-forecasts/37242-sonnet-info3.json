  "information": "On April 28, 2025, a massive power outage occurred on the Iberian Peninsula, affecting mainland Spain and Portugal. While the Canary Islands' power grid was not directly hit, the event caused significant disruptions to air travel. Reports indicated that air traffic at major hubs was operating at reduced capacity, leading to widespread flight delays and cancellations. Canary Islands airports experienced knock-on effects, with numerous flights connecting to the mainland being cancelled or delayed. One government official stated that 344 out of 6,000 scheduled flights in Spain were cancelled on that day.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5-6 weeks until the data is published in early June 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - arrivals do not fall. Based on the February 2025 data showing year-over-year growth (2,248,198 vs 2,199,255, a 2.2% increase), the baseline expectation is that tourism to the Canary Islands continues its growth trajectory.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 shows equal or higher arrivals than April 2024. The power outage on April 28 affected only the final 2-3 days of a 30-day month, with 344 cancelled flights out of 6,000 (approximately 5.7% on that day). The underlying positive tourism trend, combined with the limited temporal scope of disruptions, results in monthly totals that meet or exceed the prior year.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "April 2025 shows lower arrivals than April 2024. The power outage had cascading effects beyond April 28, causing extended disruptions. Additionally, Trump's trade policies materially suppressed US tourism earlier in the month. Other factors such as unfavorable Easter timing, poor weather, or economic headwinds compound to produce a year-over-year decline.",
    "rationale": "The February 2025 data provides crucial context showing positive momentum with 2.2% year-over-year growth. This establishes a baseline expectation that the Canary Islands tourism sector is healthy. The April 28 power outage, while disruptive, affected only the final days of April - representing roughly 7-10% of the month's travel activity. With 344 out of 6,000 flights cancelled on that single day, even assuming similar disruption for a second day, the impact on monthly totals would be limited to perhaps 1-2% of overall arrivals. Tourist destinations typically show strong resilience to short-term disruptions. The Trump policy concerns mentioned in the background appear speculative, and US tourists represent a minority of Canary Islands visitors compared to European markets. Without evidence of significant demand weakness earlier in April, the probability of a full month decline seems low. Why not lower (15-20%): We lack complete information about April 2025 conditions, including Easter timing differences, weather patterns, economic factors, or other unreported disruptions that could have affected the full month. The power outage could have psychological effects on bookings beyond its immediate impact. Why not higher (40%+): The positive February trend is strong evidence, the power outage disruption was temporally limited, and tourism demand has proven resilient. For a monthly total to decline requires sustained weakness throughout the month, not just a few days of disruption. I would update higher if evidence emerged of significant demand weakness earlier in April or additional major disruptions. I would update lower with data showing strong booking patterns or minimal lasting impact from the outage.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill inbound airline passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands fall in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Canarias braces for the consequences of Trump's policies on tourism, potentially leading to a decline in tourist arrivals from the US](https://diariodeavisos.elespanol.com/2025/04/turismo-aranceles/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the total number of passenger arrivals to the Canary Islands for the month of April 2025, as presented at the [Canary Islands Tourism Research site](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/en/inbound-tourism-arrival-passengers/monthly-data), is lower than the total number for April 2024. If the number for April 2025 is greater than or equal to the number for April 2024, the question resolves as **No**.\n\nSpecifically, Metaculus will access \"Passenger arrivals (AENA). April 2025,\" which is expected to be posted in the beginning of June 2025. The numbers considered will be the monthly totals under Canary Islands. For example, in the [February 2025 report](https://investigacion.turismodeislascanarias.com/sites/default/files/2025-03/Promotur_AENA_febrero%202025_EN.pdf), the number shown for February 2025 is 2,248,198 and the number shown for February 2024 is 2,199,255. Thus, if the question had been comparing February 2025 with February 2024, it would have resolved as No, because the number went up.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn April 28, 2025, a massive power outage occurred on the Iberian Peninsula, affecting mainland Spain and Portugal.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
