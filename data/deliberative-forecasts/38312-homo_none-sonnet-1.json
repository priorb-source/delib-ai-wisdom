    "review": "Both forecasters provided analyses that closely align with my own reasoning. They identified the same critical factors: (1) no invitation extended despite it being June 3rd, (2) other guest nations (Australia, Ukraine) already invited, (3) severe Canada-India diplomatic tensions over the Nijjar case, (4) extremely tight timeframe for logistical preparation, and (5) India's historical participation in recent G7 summits under other hosts. Forecaster 2 particularly emphasized that India has been a 'regular participant' in recent summits (UK 2021, Germany 2022, Japan 2023), making this year's apparent exclusion more notable. Both forecasters characterized the lack of invitation as likely a 'deliberate decision' by Canada, which is a stronger framing than I used initially. The independent convergence of both forecasters on exactly 15% is noteworthy and suggests good consensus around this probability range. Neither raised fundamentally new evidence I hadn't considered, but their consistent emphasis on the deliberate exclusion aspect and the breaking of India's recent pattern of participation strengthens the case for a slightly lower probability than my initial 18%.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I find their reasoning compelling and well-calibrated. The fact that two independent forecasters arrived at exactly 15% suggests this may be a more appropriate central estimate than my 18%. While my core analysis remains sound, their framing of Canada's decision as 'deliberate' given the explicit invitations to other nations, combined with India's consistent recent participation at G7 summits being broken, strengthens the argument for a lower probability. The 15-18% range represents reasonable uncertainty, but the consensus pulls me toward the lower end. The combination of: (1) no invitation at this late date, (2) strained bilateral relations that show no signs of rapid improvement, (3) explicit invitations already extended to other guests, and (4) logistical constraints all point to attendance being highly unlikely. I'm adjusting my forecast downward but not all the way to 15% because I maintain slightly more weight on the possibility of rapid diplomatic shifts or last-minute arrangements than the other forecasters appear to.",
