  "information": "According to the US Census Bureau, the US trade deficit for goods reached a record $162 billion in March 2025, a 9.6% increase from February. This was driven by a surge in imports, which increased by $16.3 billion to $342.7 billion. This rise in imports was attributed to businesses stockpiling goods in anticipation of new tariffs. US exports of goods in March 2025 increased by $2.2 billion to $180.8 billion, a 1.2% increase from February and a 6.8% increase from March 2024.\n\nSweeping new tariffs were implemented by the US administration on April 2, 2025, which were followed by retaliatory measures from multiple countries. Subsequent shipping data showed that China-US bookings were down 45% year-over-year. Additionally, manufacturing PMI reports from the period indicated contracting activity in the sector.\n\nTotal US exports for February 2025 were reported at $278.5 billion. Historical data shows that between 79% and 93% of Aprils have seen a year-over-year gain in exports. The Atlanta Federal Reserve estimated that trade subtracted 3 percentage points from GDP in the first quarter of 2025.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 to 2 months. The data for April 2025 will be released in the U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services report in early June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo would be a 'Yes' outcome. Historical data shows that year-over-year export gains are common (occurring in 79-93% of Aprils), and recent months (February/March 2025) showed total export levels comfortably above the $262.6 billion threshold, driven by typical economic growth and inflation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sweeping tariffs implemented on April 2, 2025, and subsequent international retaliatory measures cause a sharp, immediate contraction in US export activity. The significant drop in shipping to key partners like China and a downturn in manufacturing activity lead to April export values falling below April 2024 levels.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The initial impact of the new tariffs is less severe or delayed more than anticipated. Strong export performance to non-retaliating countries, coupled with underlying inflation, buoys the nominal value of exports. The monthly total remains above the threshold, similar to the levels seen in February and March 2025, despite the new trade frictions.",
    "rationale": "My forecast weighs the strong historical precedent for year-over-year export growth against the severe and immediate economic shock of new tariffs and retaliatory actions. The key factor driving my forecast towards a 'No' outcome is the timing. The tariffs were implemented on April 2, 2025, making April the first full month to bear their impact. The supporting data is compelling: China-US shipping bookings, a strong leading indicator, are reportedly down 45% year-over-year, and manufacturing PMI reports indicate contraction. This suggests a sharp reduction in export volumes. While total exports in February ($278.5 billion) and March (estimated around $278 billion) were well above the $262.6 billion threshold, the March strength was likely an anomaly caused by businesses front-loading exports to get ahead of the anticipated tariffs and retaliation. This suggests the March high is not sustainable and a sharp drop in April is likely. The forecast is not lower than 30% because there is still a chance that trade proves resilient. Exports could be rerouted to other countries, existing contracts could be fulfilled in early April, and persistent inflation could keep the nominal export value above the threshold even with a decline in real volume. My forecast is not higher because the provided evidence of a trade shock is recent, specific, and significant, and should be weighted more heavily than historical trends in this context. I would increase my forecast if new data showed shipping volumes recovering or if major trading partners announced a rollback of retaliatory measures.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US Census Bureau report an increase in US exports in April 2025 compared with April 2024?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Experts React: How the world is responding to Trump’s ‘liberation day’ tariffs](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/experts-react/experts-react-how-the-world-is-responding-to-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
