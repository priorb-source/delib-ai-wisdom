  "information": "According to multiple news outlets, U.S. government bodies have documented 757 cases of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) between May 2023 and June 2024. Of this total, 708 occurred in airspace, and only 49 cases had been officially closed as of early 2025. The Department of Defense's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO) is the primary body for receiving these reports. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also investigates UAP sightings, especially those confirmed by radar, and shares its findings with the Department of Defense.\n\nA specific incident in January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 Viper fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object during a training mission over Arizona, causing damage to the aircraft's canopy. The object was described as an 'orange-white uncrewed aerial system' (UAS). This is one of numerous encounters reported by military pilots in the region, establishing Arizona as a hotspot for UAP sightings, particularly near military training areas and the border with Mexico. Former government intelligence officer Luis Elizondo confirmed that there has been significant reported activity in the area.\n\nSome U.S. officials speculate that a portion of the UAP sightings, especially in the Southwest, could be attributable to advanced drone technology used by drug cartels for espionage or smuggling. Ron Vitiello, an advisor to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, noted that the 'unlimited funding' of cartels could enable them to deploy technologies previously unseen in the drone sector. This theory has been presented as a potential explanation for some of the unidentified objects observed in restricted military airspace.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 41 days. June 2025 begins in 10 days (on June 1), spans 30 days, and the outcome will be determined when Metaculus checks the NUFORC website on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Based on recent historical data, cube-shaped UFO sightings do occur and get reported to NUFORC. December 2024 had 6 cube-shaped sightings posted, establishing that such reports are part of the normal flow of submissions to NUFORC, even if they are relatively rare compared to other shapes.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "June 2025 passes without any witnesses reporting cube-shaped UFO sightings to NUFORC, or any such reports received are not processed and posted to the website by July 1, 2025. This could occur if cube-shaped sightings are genuinely rare and December 2024's six reports were an anomalous spike, or if June experiences lower overall UFO reporting activity than typical months.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one individual witnesses and reports a cube-shaped UFO/UAP to NUFORC during June 2025, and NUFORC processes and posts this report to their event database accessible at the specified link by the time Metaculus checks on or after July 1, 2025. Given that December 2024 had 6 such reports, even a fraction of that activity would satisfy the resolution criteria.",
    "rationale": "The key insight is that we have recent empirical evidence from December 2024 showing 6 cube-shaped sightings were reported to NUFORC in a single month. While the question background notes these are 'rare in the history of NUFORC,' the fact that they occurred recently and in meaningful numbers suggests a non-trivial base rate. The resolution criteria requires only ONE cube-shaped sighting in June 2025, which is a significantly lower bar than December's six reports. If we conservatively assume December was somewhat above average but not entirely anomalous, and estimate perhaps 1-3 cube-shaped sightings per average month, the probability of at least one in June seems reasonably high. The research assistant's report about general UAP activity (757 cases between May 2023-June 2024) confirms that UFO reporting remains active, though it doesn't specifically address shape distributions. Why not higher (75-85%): The 'rare' descriptor suggests genuine scarcity, and December could have been an outlier. There's month-to-month variation in reporting, and we don't know if any seasonal factors affect cube-shaped sightings specifically. Why not lower (45-55%): We have concrete recent evidence that these reports do occur. NUFORC continues operating normally. We need only one report, and December's data suggests the probability of zero cube reports in a given month is likely below 50%. I would update higher if: additional data showed January-May 2025 also had cube sightings, or if there were news of increased UAP reporting activity. I would update lower if: subsequent months showed December was a clear anomaly with no cube sightings, or if NUFORC experienced operational disruptions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the National UFO Reporting Center report a sighting of a cube-shaped UFO in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a report of a sighting of a UFO/UAP shaped like a cube in June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/ndx/?id=event) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nFor example, although rare in the history of NUFORC, the month of December 2024 [had](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=e202412) six sightings with a cube shape.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to multiple news outlets, U.S. government bodies have documented 757 cases of Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) between May 2023 and June 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
