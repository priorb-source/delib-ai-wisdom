    "review": "All three forecasters converge on similar math: reaching 550k from 500k requires adding approximately 14-17k units per month over the remaining period. However, I notice a potential error in Forecaster 2's reasoning - they mention the 'traditional spring/summer buying season when demand typically picks up' as a challenge, but higher buying activity would actually *reduce* inventory through sales, not increase it. This confuses supply and demand dynamics. Forecaster 3 raises an important point I underweighted: the construction pipeline of homes already under construction will complete regardless of market conditions, which could push inventory higher. They also correctly note that even in weak markets, some sales prevent unlimited inventory accumulation. Both forecasters appropriately emphasize that 10% quarterly growth from an already extreme base (highest since 2007) is historically unusual and that markets tend to adjust at extremes. The consensus across all three analyses is in the 28-38% range, suggesting reasonable alignment on the core dynamics despite slightly different weightings.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I maintain that status quo bias favors modest growth or stabilization rather than a rapid 10% surge in just three months from an already historic peak. The construction pipeline argument is valid but likely already reflected in the established upward trend. The key constraint remains that we're at November 2007 levels - market mechanisms typically trigger adjustments at such extremes through builder behavior and some baseline sales activity. However, the strong multi-year momentum and potential for continued weak demand due to elevated rates keep meaningful probability on the YES outcome. Given we're already in May 2025, the outcome is largely determined but we lack March-April data that would be highly informative. The 28-30% range appears most defensible given these considerations. I'm adjusting slightly downward to 29% to give somewhat more weight to the 'rare for 10% quarterly jumps from high bases' argument and the sales-preventing-unlimited-accumulation dynamic.",
