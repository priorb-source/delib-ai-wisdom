    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling points I underweighted. Forecaster 2's observation about automatic removal through spoilage control is particularly strong - expired products (best-by dates in late February) would have been pulled from vending machines through routine operations, making verification simpler than I initially considered. Forecaster 3 provides useful base rate information (2-4 months for similar recalls) and notes we're at ~10 weeks, which is the midpoint of that window, not the beginning. This temporal framing is more optimistic than my initial analysis suggested. However, I find their optimism somewhat overstated given the hard deadline of only 24 days remaining. The key tension is between two facts: (1) the practical work should be straightforward and possibly complete, versus (2) the demonstrated administrative slowness (74 days without closure) combined with a tight remaining window. Both forecasters acknowledge this tension but weight the simplicity factors more heavily than I did.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating modestly upward but remaining more cautious than my peers. The strongest arguments for increasing my forecast are: (1) the automatic removal of expired products through normal vending machine operations greatly simplifies verification - this is a more significant factor than I initially weighted, (2) at 10 weeks post-initiation, we're in the middle of the typical 2-4 month closure window, not at the beginning, and (3) a 90-day closure (late May) is plausible for such a straightforward case. However, I maintain greater weight on the status quo and time constraints. The recall has shown no movement in 74 days despite the simplicity factors being present throughout. With only 24 days remaining and no evidence of recent progress, the probability of administrative completion before June 1 remains constrained. FSIS processing involves multiple verification steps and documentation cycles that rarely accelerate dramatically. I'm updating from 32% to 38%, splitting the difference between my initial assessment and the other forecasters while maintaining my relatively cautious stance on bureaucratic timelines.",
