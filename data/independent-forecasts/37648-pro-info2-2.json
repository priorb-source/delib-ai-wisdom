  "information": "The U.S. administration has outlined 14 non-negotiable 'red lines' for any new nuclear deal with Iran. These conditions include the complete removal of all of Iran's enriched uranium, the dismantling of its centrifuges, and the absence of any 'sunset clauses' that would allow restrictions to expire. President Trump has stated he is open to a deal to make the region safer, but his administration has also recently imposed new sanctions on Iran. Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has called the introduction of new sanctions during negotiations 'unacceptable.' Vice President J.D. Vance has publicly stated that Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon is 'completely off the table.' The U.S. negotiating position emphasizes the need for a 'strong agreement' with robust verification measures.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new nuclear deal is announced, and the current state of high tensions, US sanctions, and Iranian nuclear advancement continues.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The fundamental disagreements between the US and Iran prove too wide to bridge in the short time remaining. The US's hardline 'red lines' are not relaxed, Iran refuses to capitulate, and the deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without an agreement being announced.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Intense, secret back-channel diplomacy, possibly driven by a mutual desire to de-escalate regional tensions, leads to a surprise breakthrough. Both sides agree to a limited, interim deal that freezes certain nuclear activities in exchange for partial sanctions relief, which is then formally announced.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo of no deal. The primary obstacle is the extreme divergence in negotiating positions. The research report highlights a maximalist US stance with 14 'non-negotiable' conditions, including the complete dismantling of Iran's enrichment infrastructure. This is a non-starter for any sovereign Iranian government. Furthermore, the US is actively imposing new sanctions, an action that traditionally undermines trust and torpedoes negotiations. The short-time frame of approximately six weeks is highly insufficient to overcome decades of mistrust and bridge such a significant policy chasm. While the Israeli media report suggesting a 'high chance' of a deal is a notable piece of counter-evidence that prevents me from setting the probability near zero, it is a single report weighed against substantial public evidence of intransigence. The world generally changes slowly, and the diplomatic hurdles here are immense.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because secret negotiations can yield surprising results, and the media report, even if an outlier, suggests some movement may be happening behind the scenes. A major regional security crisis could also rapidly alter calculations for both sides, forcing a compromise.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because the publicly stated US demands are fundamentally incompatible with a deal Iran could accept. To reach a 'Yes' outcome, the US would have to dramatically abandon its stated red lines, an event for which there is currently no public evidence.\n\nI would increase my forecast significantly upon credible reports of the US softening its position, a joint announcement of direct high-level talks, or a mutual de-escalatory step like a verifiable pause in enrichment in exchange for a sanctions waiver.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States and Iran announce a new nuclear deal before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nIsraeli media (Hebrew): [Senior ministers were informed: There is a high chance that the US and Iran will reach an agreement](https://www.kan.org.il/content/kan-news/politic/895178/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the US and Iran sign or announce an agreement with respect to Iran's nuclear program.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe U.S. administration has outlined 14 non-negotiable 'red lines' for any new nuclear deal with Iran. These conditions include the complete removal of all of Iran's enriched uranium, the dismantling of its centrifuges, and the absence of any 'sunset clauses' that would allow restrictions to expire.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
