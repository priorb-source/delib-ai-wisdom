  "information": "According to the US Census Bureau, housing starts declined by 14.2% month-over-month in March 2025 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 940,000 units. In the same month, building permits for single-family homes decreased by 2% month-over-month. Builder confidence, as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index (HMI), was reported to be around 42.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6-8 weeks. May 2025 data is typically released by the US Census Bureau in late June 2025, so the outcome should be known by early to mid-July 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the inventory remains near current levels around 500,000 units",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The inventory of new single-family homes for sale stabilizes or grows modestly to 520-540k by May 2025. The March 2025 decline in housing starts (down 14.2%) and building permits (down 2%) translates to fewer new homes being completed and listed in subsequent months. Low builder confidence (HMI of 42) causes builders to hold back on new listings. Some existing inventory gets absorbed, preventing further significant accumulation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The strong upward momentum continues from February's 500k level. Despite declining starts and permits, builders continue listing previously-started homes that are nearing completion. Slow sales velocity due to affordability challenges means inventory continues accumulating. The 3-month period from February to May sees continued monthly increases averaging 16-17k per month, pushing the total above 550k.",
    "rationale": "The question requires inventory to increase from 500k (February 2025) to above 550k (May 2025) - a 10% increase over approximately 3 months, or roughly 3.3% monthly growth. While the long-term trend has been strongly upward (tripling over 13 years to reach historic highs), the recent March 2025 data presents concerning headwinds. Housing starts declined 14.2% month-over-month and single-family permits fell 2%, both suggesting a cooling in the pipeline of new inventory. The NAHB confidence index at 42 (below the neutral 50 level) indicates builders are pessimistic about market conditions. These leading indicators typically precede reduced inventory growth by 3-6 months. However, there are factors supporting continued growth: the current level of 500k demonstrates strong momentum, completed homes from earlier starts will continue entering the market, and if sales remain slow, inventory naturally accumulates. The base rate principle suggests modest changes from the status quo - we're already very close at 500k, but reaching 550k requires acceleration beyond recent trends. My forecast is not higher because the March data shows clear deceleration signals and builder sentiment is weak. It's not lower because we're starting from a high base (500k) that's only 50k away from the threshold, and there's still 3 months for inventory to build. I would revise upward if April data showed inventory already at 520k+ or if starts/permits rebounded. I would revise downward if April data showed inventory declining or stagnating below 510k.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of new single family homes for sale in the US exceed 550 thousand in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Kobeissi Letter](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1912142359577403619): \"BREAKING: The number of new single-family homes for sale has surged to 500,000 in February, the highest since November 2007.\n\nThe number of new homes on the market has more than TRIPLED over the last 13 years, from a low of 142,000.\n\nExcluding the 2006 housing bubble this is, by far, the largest supply of new homes in history.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of New One Family Homes for Sale in the United States reported for May 2025 is greater than 550 thousand, according to what is presented by [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HNFSEPUSSA).\n\nEnsure units is set to \"Thousands of Units, Seasonally Adjusted\" and frequency is set to \"Monthly, End of Month\". Question resolves based on the number presented by FRED, and no other resolution source will be considered.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, housing starts declined by 14.2% month-over-month in March 2025 to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 940,000 units. In the same month, building permits for single-family homes decreased by 2% month-over-month. Builder confidence, as measured by the NAHB Housing Market Index (HMI), was reported to be around 42.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
