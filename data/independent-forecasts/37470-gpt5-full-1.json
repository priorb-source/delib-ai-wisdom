  "information": "On April 29, 2025, Egypt's Minister of Youth and Sports, Dr. Ashraf Sobhy, met with Gilberto Gartner, a Brazilian national who is the President of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF). The purpose of the meeting was to discuss Egypt's bid to host the 2026 World Traditional Karate Championship. Dr. Sobhy stated that Egypt has organized over 440 sports events in recent years, citing its modern sports infrastructure. President Gartner expressed confidence in Egypt's ability to host the championship successfully, noting he had witnessed a high level of organization at the World Gymnastics Championship in Egypt and that the country has a large base of karate practitioners.\n\nEgypt has a recent history of hosting major international sporting events. In April 2025, the country hosted the World Karate Premier League in Cairo, which involved 384 players from 67 countries. In May 2025, Egypt hosted the Pharaohs' Championship for Rhythmic Gymnastics with 18 participating countries, the African Championship for Rhythmic Gymnastics with 8 participating countries, and the 25th World Military Equestrian Championship with 20 participating nations. Egypt is also scheduled to host the Senior World Karate Championships (an event of the separate World Karate Federation) in November 2025.\n\nAnalysis of the International Traditional Karate Federation (ITKF) indicates a pattern of announcing World Championship hosts 24 to 36 months prior to the event. As of mid-May 2025, there is no mention of Egypt's 2026 bid, nor any related bid documentation, on the ITKF's official website. There have been no public reports of other nations submitting competing bids for the 2026 championship. Egypt previously hosted an ITKF event in 2014.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 7 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement by ITKF before the deadline; question resolves No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "ITKF defers the 2026 host selection to its General Assembly or a later board meeting (likely in the second half of 2025), or keeps discussions ongoing without a formal decision or public announcement before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Within May–June 2025, ITKF issues an official announcement (website, press release, or verified social channel) naming Egypt as the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship host, possibly following an executive committee decision or MoU signing.",
    "rationale": "- Timing and process: The research assistant notes ITKF historically announces World Championship hosts 24–36 months in advance. For a 2026 event, that window largely passed, implying either a deviation from pattern or that the decision will occur later in 2025 (often federations select and announce the next host at a mid/late-year congress alongside a major event). With less than two months left, inertia favors no announcement by July 1.\n- Current signals: As of mid-May 2025, there is no host announcement on ITKF’s site and no bid documentation publicly visible. The Egyptian minister met the ITKF President on April 29 to discuss a bid, with positive rhetoric about Egypt’s capability and track record. This is a favorable signal but still short of a federation-level commitment. Also, the resolution requires an ITKF announcement (not just Egyptian media/government statements), which is a higher bar.\n- Capacity and precedent: Egypt’s strong hosting record (including major 2025 events and prior ITKF involvement) makes Egypt a credible host. Smaller federations can be flexible and may announce on shorter timelines, which keeps the probability from being very low.\n- Why not higher: Lack of official ITKF communications to date, typical governance cadence (decisions at congresses/board meetings), and the short time window weigh against a near-term announcement.\n- Why not lower: Clear interest from both sides, Egypt’s demonstrated capability, and the possibility of an executive decision and quick press release in May/June keep a non-trivial chance alive.\n- What would move me up: Evidence of an imminent ITKF executive meeting or congress before July 1; leaked or posted ITKF bid materials; an MoU or joint ITKF–Egypt statement signaling selection pending ratification; ITKF teasing an upcoming host announcement on official channels.\n- What would move me down: Confirmation that host selection is scheduled for a late-2025 assembly; credible reports of competing bids requiring a longer evaluation; continued silence from ITKF through June.\nOverall, the status quo and procedural timing dominate, but recent engagement and Egypt’s capabilities justify a modest chance of a quick announcement.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
