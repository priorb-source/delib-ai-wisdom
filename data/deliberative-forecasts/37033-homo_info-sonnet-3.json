    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most compelling new argument that significantly affects my assessment: the comparative payment cadence analysis. The February payment of $20M to European farmers ($145M over 4 years = approximately 3-4 payments annually) provides crucial context I hadn't fully developed. This suggests payments occur every 3-6 months, which would place the next payment in July-October, after the June 1 deadline. Forecaster 2's point about treasury bonds potentially counting as payment is noted, though the resolution criteria's reference to 'additional such disbursements' following the 'first compensation payment' of cash suggests similar cash payments are expected. The key insight is that only 38 days remain, and the first payment occurred just 14 days ago. Without evidence of a more aggressive payment schedule or specific announcements of imminent disbursements, typical government payment patterns strongly argue against another payment in such a short window.",
    "rationale": "Upon review, I find Forecaster 3's cadence analysis more persuasive than I initially weighted. The European farmers compensation framework ($145M over 4 years) provides strong evidence that Zimbabwe follows quarterly or semi-annual payment schedules for these compensation programs. With only 38 days remaining and the first payment occurring 14 days ago, the probability of another payment appears lower than my initial 40% assessment. However, I don't fully adopt the 25% forecast because: (1) the $10M for 2025 is a single-year budget allocation, potentially allowing for faster disbursement than the multi-year European framework; (2) the government's April 10 reaffirmation shows active engagement; (3) there remains some possibility of bond issuance if that counts as payment. The status quo strongly favors no second payment given typical bureaucratic timelines and the lack of announced payment schedules. My forecast decreases to account for the payment cadence evidence while maintaining some probability for accelerated disbursement or bond issuance.",
