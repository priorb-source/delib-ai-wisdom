    "review": "Both forecasters correctly emphasize the small-n nature of monthly pilot-flagged NUFORC reports and the tie-to-No rule, which materially lowers the chance of a Yes. They also fairly frame California as Florida’s main competitor. New useful emphasis from Forecaster 2 is the tie risk at low counts (e.g., 1–1 or 2–2), which I agree is a central driver toward No. Forecaster 3’s point about California’s structural advantages (aviation volume/history) is reasonable, but they conflate months at one point and neither forecaster addresses key data-quality risks: (1) military incidents often don’t surface as NUFORC pilot reports; (2) NUFORC may consolidate multiple witness reports of the same incident; and (3) offshore/ambiguous locations may not credit Florida. Those factors blunt the upside from a single high-profile Florida incident. Net, I find their arguments directionally sound but slightly optimistic relative to these reporting frictions.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: ~8–12 pilot-flagged reports/month nationwide; CA and FL lead, with AZ/TX/WA as the next tier. For Florida to be the unique leader in March, it likely needs at least one more pilot report than CA (and all others), which is hard at low totals and with ties resolving to No. The March 28 Florida military incident could produce multiple pilot submissions—but military events often stay within official channels or appear as a single public entry, and NUFORC may merge near-duplicate reports. There’s also a risk the event is logged as offshore/unknown rather than Florida. We have one reported CA pilot sighting in March, which already raises the bar for a Florida win. I had weighted these issues heavily in my prior 29%. The other forecasters’ reasoning doesn’t add new hard evidence but does reasonably argue that a notable Florida incident can increase the chance of multiple Florida entries. I’ll make a small upward adjustment to reflect that upside tail, while still discounting for consolidation/underreporting and the tie-to-No rule.",
