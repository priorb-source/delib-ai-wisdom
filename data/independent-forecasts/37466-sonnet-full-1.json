  "information": "On January 20, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, ordering the renaming of the U.S. continental shelf off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to the 'Gulf of America'. Subsequently, he declared February 9 as the 'Day of the Gulf of America'. In response, several U.S. federal agencies have begun using the new name. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) updated its website graphics and tropical weather bulletins to use 'Gulf of America', and the U.S. Coast Guard has used the term in an official press release.\n\nThe adoption of the name 'Gulf of America' has varied among non-governmental entities. Google updated its Maps service to display 'Gulf of America' for users in the United States, while in other regions, both names are sometimes used. As of late January 2025, other major map publishers like National Geographic and Apple had not made the change. The renaming has generated international controversy, with Mexican officials, including President Claudia Sheinbaum, protesting the unilateral change. The International Hydrographic Organization, which works to standardize the names of bodies of water, has not officially recognized the new name.\n\nThe name 'Gulf of Mexico' has been established for centuries, dating back to the 16th century. The body of water is bordered by the United States, Mexico, and Cuba and is considered international waters under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. A previous proposal to rename it the 'Gulf of America' in 2012 was not approved. The website in question, WorldAtlas.com, is a Canadian-based company. While its main North America map currently displays 'Gulf of Mexico', the title of its specific article on the gulf reads: 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 54 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the North America page on WorldAtlas.com continues to display 'Gulf of Mexico' as it currently does",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas maintains its current labeling on the North America map page, displaying 'Gulf of Mexico' as they await broader international recognition and standardization through bodies like the International Hydrographic Organization before making changes to their primary map displays",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas updates their North America map page within the next 54 days to reflect the U.S. naming convention, either displaying 'Gulf of America' alone or in combination with 'Gulf of Mexico', following the precedent set by Google Maps and responding to usage by U.S. federal agencies",
    "rationale": "The key evidence suggests moderate but not high probability for this outcome. Positive indicators include: (1) WorldAtlas has already acknowledged the new name by updating their article title to 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)', showing awareness and some accommodation of the change; (2) Some entities like Google Maps and U.S. federal agencies have adopted the new name; (3) There are still 54 days remaining for the change to occur. However, significant countervailing factors suggest caution: (1) WorldAtlas is a Canadian-based company, less subject to U.S. political pressure and more likely to follow international standards; (2) Nearly 4 months have passed since the January 20 executive order, and they have not updated their main North America map despite updating the article title; (3) Major mapping services like National Geographic and Apple had not adopted the change as of late January; (4) The International Hydrographic Organization has not recognized the new name; (5) The change is internationally controversial, particularly with Mexico. The fact that WorldAtlas updated their article title but not their primary map display suggests a deliberate wait-and-see approach. Map publishers typically change established geographical names slowly and only when there is broad international consensus. The centuries-old 'Gulf of Mexico' designation and lack of international recognition make a full map update less likely. For my forecast to increase, I would need to see: major international mapping services (National Geographic, Apple) adopting the name, or statements from WorldAtlas indicating planned updates. For it to decrease: explicit statements from WorldAtlas maintaining current naming, or continued inaction from other major mapping services. Given status quo bias and the pattern of cautious commercial behavior by international mapping services, I estimate a 25% probability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn January 20, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, ordering the renaming of the U.S. continental shelf off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to the 'Gulf of America'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
