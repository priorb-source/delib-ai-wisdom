  "information": "In late April 2025, during a series of town hall meetings, Beto O'Rourke stated that he would consider running for the U.S. Senate if it aligns with the desires of Texas voters. Quoted in multiple outlets such as Fox News, The Hill, and Yahoo, he said, 'If it comes to pass that this is what the people of Texas want, that it's the highest and best use of what I can give to you, then yes, I will.' As of late May 2025, O'Rourke had not filed any formal candidacy papers with the FEC and no campaign infrastructure or exploratory committee was visible. He continues his work with the voter mobilization organization 'Powered by People,' which he founded in 2019.\n\nThe 2026 Texas U.S. Senate election features incumbent Republican Senator John Cornyn seeking a fifth term. Cornyn faces a primary challenge from Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who has already announced his campaign. On the Democratic side, while O'Rourke is publicly considering a run, other figures like former Congressman Colin Allred have also been mentioned as potential candidates, though none had formally entered the race as of late May 2025.\n\nHistorical timelines for major Texas campaigns show variation. For the 2024 Senate race, Democrat Colin Allred announced his candidacy in May 2023, 17 months before the election. Beto O'Rourke's own record includes announcing his 2018 Senate bid 20 months early (March 2017) and his 2022 gubernatorial run 12 months early (November 2021). The question's deadline of July 1, 2025, is approximately 16 months prior to the November 2026 general election.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days (from May 22, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement - O'Rourke has not filed candidacy papers, established campaign infrastructure, or made a formal announcement as of late May 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "O'Rourke continues to 'consider' the race through June without committing. He may be waiting for additional polling data, fundraising signals, or clarity on the Democratic field. He either decides against running or delays his announcement until after July 1, 2025, potentially to coordinate with summer fundraising cycles or wait for more favorable political conditions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Within the next 5-6 weeks, O'Rourke concludes that voter sentiment and political conditions favor a Senate run. He quickly assembles his campaign team (leveraging his existing network from previous races), files FEC paperwork, and announces his candidacy in mid-to-late June 2025, which would be 16 months before the November 2026 election - consistent with his historical announcement timelines.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. As of late May 2025, O'Rourke has made only conditional statements ('if' voters want him to run), with no FEC filing, campaign infrastructure, or exploratory committee visible. Good forecasting practices suggest weighting the status quo heavily, especially with only 40 days remaining until the deadline. However, several factors prevent this from being a very low probability: (1) The July 1 deadline would place an announcement 16 months before the election, which aligns with O'Rourke's historical patterns (20 months for 2018 Senate, 12 months for 2022 Governor) and is typical for major Texas campaigns; (2) O'Rourke is publicly and seriously discussing the possibility, suggesting it's an active consideration; (3) He has substantial name recognition and existing networks that could enable a relatively quick campaign launch if he decides to run; (4) 40 days, while short, is sufficient time for a political decision and announcement. The conditional nature of his recent statements ('if it comes to pass that this is what the people of Texas want') suggests he's still in a decision-making phase rather than campaign-building mode. The absence of any visible campaign preparation as of late May makes a June announcement less likely but not impossible. For the probability to increase, I would need to see: campaign hiring, FEC activity, scheduled announcement events, or more definitive public commitments. For it to decrease further: explicit statements ruling out a run, another strong Democrat entering the race, or continued focus on his current voter mobilization work through mid-June without campaign development.",
