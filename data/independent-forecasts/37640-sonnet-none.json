    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 48 days from May 14, 2025 to July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The website remains online. As of May 7, 2025, EnergyStar.gov is confirmed up and reachable, continuing its 33-year operational history.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The EPA rapidly executes the elimination directive, taking down the EnergyStar.gov website before July 1, 2025 as part of shuttering the program and the Office of Atmospheric Protection.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The website remains online due to bureaucratic inertia, legal requirements for archiving government information, slower-than-expected implementation of the elimination directive, political or legal challenges to the shutdown, or a decision to maintain the website even while winding down active program operations.",
    "rationale": "Strong status quo bias favors the website remaining online. Government websites rarely disappear quickly, even when programs are defunded or eliminated. Key factors supporting a high probability: (1) Only 48 days is an extremely short timeline for shutting down a major federal website that has operated for 33 years - government bureaucracy typically moves much slower; (2) There are likely legal requirements for archiving, public notice periods, and transition plans; (3) Even eliminated programs often maintain their websites for months or years for historical reference and ongoing obligations; (4) The announcement indicates the program is 'being' eliminated (future/ongoing process), not that elimination is complete; (5) Taking down the website requires coordination across multiple departments, IT systems, and may face resistance. Factors that could lower my forecast: Clear evidence of rapid website migration or shutdown preparation, or precedent of this administration shutting down similar sites quickly. Factors that could raise it: Any legal challenges, Congressional pushback, or statements indicating the website will be maintained for archival purposes. The key insight is that the question asks about website accessibility, not program activity - these can diverge significantly. My forecast is not higher (90%+) because there is a definitive elimination directive from leadership and 48 days is theoretically enough time if there's strong political will. It's not lower (60-70%) because historical precedent strongly suggests government websites persist well beyond program elimination dates.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the EPA's EnergyStar.gov still be online on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/06/climate/epa-energy-star-eliminated.html), \"'The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,' Paul Gunning, the director of the E.P.A. Office of Atmospheric Protection, told employees during the meeting, according to the recording obtained by The New York Times. Mr. Gunning’s office itself is also slated for elimination.\n\nFor the past 33 years, Energy Star has been known for its recognizable blue label, which shows that an appliance has met energy efficiency standards set by the federal government.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if EnergyStar.gov is online according to [Is It Down Right Now?](https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/energystar.gov.html) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nAs of May 7, 2025, the resolution source returns the message, \"Energystar.gov is UP and reachable by us.\"\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
