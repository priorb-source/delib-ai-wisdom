  "information": "On January 20, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, ordering the renaming of the U.S. continental shelf off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to the 'Gulf of America'. Subsequently, he declared February 9 as the 'Day of the Gulf of America'. In response, several U.S. federal agencies have begun using the new name. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) updated its website graphics and tropical weather bulletins to use 'Gulf of America', and the U.S. Coast Guard has used the term in an official press release.\n\nThe adoption of the name 'Gulf of America' has varied among non-governmental entities. Google updated its Maps service to display 'Gulf of America' for users in the United States, while in other regions, both names are sometimes used. As of late January 2025, other major map publishers like National Geographic and Apple had not made the change. The renaming has generated international controversy, with Mexican officials, including President Claudia Sheinbaum, protesting the unilateral change. The International Hydrographic Organization, which works to standardize the names of bodies of water, has not officially recognized the new name.\n\nThe name 'Gulf of Mexico' has been established for centuries, dating back to the 16th century. The body of water is bordered by the United States, Mexico, and Cuba and is considered international waters under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. A previous proposal to rename it the 'Gulf of America' in 2012 was not approved. The website in question, WorldAtlas.com, is a Canadian-based company. While its main North America map currently displays 'Gulf of Mexico', the title of its specific article on the gulf reads: 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)'.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 7 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the North America page continues to show “Gulf of Mexico.”",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas keeps its continental map and page text unchanged, citing international standards and avoiding a unilateral U.S.-centric rename; by July 1 the page still labels the water as “Gulf of Mexico.”",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "WorldAtlas updates the North America page to reflect dual naming (e.g., “Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America)” or “Gulf of America, formerly Gulf of Mexico”) or replaces the label outright, bringing that page in line with the updated article title.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence and status quo: As of late January 2025, the WorldAtlas North America page still showed “Gulf of Mexico,” while the dedicated article title reads “Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America).” This indicates editorial awareness and willingness to acknowledge the new U.S. usage, but not yet a site-wide or map-wide change. With only ~7 weeks left, inertia favors No.\n- External environment: The U.S. executive order and some federal agencies (NHC, USCG) adopted “Gulf of America,” and Google Maps reportedly shows it for U.S. users. However, major non-U.S./global standard-setters have not aligned: the International Hydrographic Organization hasn’t recognized the new name; National Geographic and Apple hadn’t changed as of late January. The gulf is shared by Mexico and Cuba, and the rename is internationally contested. Canadian-based WorldAtlas has incentives to hew to internationally recognized naming on general maps.\n- Site mechanics: The North America page likely uses a legacy/static map asset; changing that is more friction than editing an article title. They have already opted for a compromise on the specific article (“Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)”), which could be where they stop absent broader consensus.\n- Why not higher: International standards and cross-border sensitivities reduce the chance of a general map relabel within weeks. Lack of clear movement by other major publishers suggests limited peer pressure.\n- Why not lower: WorldAtlas has already acknowledged the term in an article title; they could apply a dual-name label to the continental page to reflect U.S. usage without fully abandoning the traditional name. If they aim for consistency across site sections, a mid-year sweep could still happen.\n- Up/down updates: I would raise the probability if (a) WorldAtlas updates other regional/landing pages to dual-name similar disputes, (b) additional major map publishers (e.g., Apple, National Geographic) adopt dual naming, or (c) IHO signals acceptance or interim recognition. I would lower it if WorldAtlas publishes guidance reaffirming use of “Gulf of Mexico” on maps pending international consensus, or if U.S. agencies roll back/soften adoption.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill WorldAtlas.com display the body of water northwest of the Caribbean Sea as the Gulf of America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWorld Atlas article: [Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)](https://www.worldatlas.com/gulfs/gulf-of-mexico.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the World Atlas website at its [North America](https://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/na.htm) page displays the body of water west of Florida, south of Louisiana and north of the Yucatán Peninsula as the Gulf of America. (At the time of this question, the name displayed is the Gulf of Mexico.)\n\nIn case both names are used, for example \"Gulf of America formerly known as Gulf of Mexico,\" this question resolves as Yes. Note that verification will be from Metaculus admins accessing the webpage from the United States and that therefore resolution will be based on how the page appears when accessed from that location.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn January 20, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 14172, ordering the renaming of the U.S. continental shelf off the coasts of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida to the 'Gulf of America'.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
