  "information": "A poll conducted by Guardian TT between April 10-13, with research by pollster Hamid Ghany, indicated that the PNM was positioned to benefit from vote-splitting in Tobago's two key seats between the Tobago Progressive Democratic Patriots (TPP) and the Progressive Democratic Patriots (PDP), potentially allowing the PNM to win both. The same poll identified that 20% of the electorate was undecided or planning to split their vote. A separate poll by WIC News showed the UNC at 72% and the PNM at 18%.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately one week. The election is on April 28, 2025, with results expected to be known within 24-48 hours of polls closing.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The incumbent People's National Movement (PNM) narrowly wins a plurality of seats, maintaining its position as the largest party in parliament, similar to the outcome of the 2020 election.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The opposition United National Congress (UNC) successfully mobilizes its base and persuades a majority of the large bloc of undecided voters to support them, flipping at least two key marginal seats from the PNM to win a plurality.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The PNM capitalizes on its incumbency advantage and a split in the opposition vote in the two Tobago constituencies, allowing it to win both. This, combined with holding its existing marginal seats, secures a plurality of 21 seats or more.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the PNM's incumbency advantage, historical voting patterns, and the provided polling data. The status quo is a narrow PNM majority (22-19 from 2020), and in closely contested elections, incumbency is a significant factor. Of the two polls provided, the WIC News poll showing the UNC with a 72% to 18% lead appears to be a significant outlier, inconsistent with the historically tight nature of Trinidad and Tobago elections, and should be heavily discounted. The Guardian TT poll provides a more plausible picture: a close race with two critical factors. First, potential vote-splitting in Tobago's two seats between the TPP and PDP, which would likely hand both seats to the PNM. This is a clear and credible path for the PNM to secure two crucial seats. Second, 20% of the electorate remains undecided, representing the primary source of uncertainty. My forecast gives a slight edge to the PNM, assuming they will benefit from the Tobago situation and that the undecided vote will not break overwhelmingly for the opposition. The probability is not higher because the large undecided bloc makes the outcome highly sensitive to late swings; a UNC victory is very plausible if they can capture a majority of these voters in marginal seats. The probability is not lower because the PNM is the incumbent and the most detailed polling evidence points to a specific mechanism (the Tobago vote-split) that directly benefits them. I would increase the probability with new polling showing the PNM gaining among undecideds. I would decrease it if a major scandal impacted the PNM or if new data suggested the opposition in Tobago was consolidating behind one party.",
