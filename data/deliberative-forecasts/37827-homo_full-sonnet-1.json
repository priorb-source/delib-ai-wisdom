    "review": "All three analyses converge on similar reasoning and calculations, which strengthens confidence in the methodology. The base rate of 4-6 pilot reports over 10 years (0.033-0.05 per month or 3-5%) is consistently identified as the key driver. Forecaster 3 makes an important point I should emphasize: the January Rwanda report shouldn't increase June's probability specifically if these are independent events randomly distributed over time. Forecaster 2's 6% forecast weights slightly above the base rate, while Forecaster 3's 5% stays at the midpoint. The key disagreement is subtle: whether recent activity justifies any premium above the strict base rate. I find Forecaster 3's independence argument compelling - the January report is now part of the historical pattern but doesn't signal a trend that makes June more likely. Forecaster 2's mention of updating conditions (additional May reports, increased awareness) is useful but we haven't observed these triggers. All forecasters appropriately avoided anchoring too high on the January event or too low by dismissing the empirical base rate entirely.",
    "rationale": "My original 5% forecast remains justified after reviewing the other analyses. The convergence on methodology - calculating monthly base rates from historical data - validates the approach. The key insight from deliberation is Forecaster 3's point about event independence: the January Rwanda report demonstrates the reporting mechanism functions but doesn't make June specifically more likely unless there's a causal trend. With only 4-6 reports over 10 years, sampling uncertainty is substantial, and the true monthly probability likely ranges from 2-8%. My 5% forecast sits at the midpoint of the calculated 3-5% base rate range, appropriately balancing the demonstrated non-zero probability against the strong empirical pattern of rarity. I see no compelling evidence to adjust either up to 6% (which would require evidence of increased reporting trends not yet observed) or down to 4% or below (which would underweight the genuine possibility given historical precedent). The status quo of rare but occasional African pilot reports to NUFORC should dominate absent new information.",
