    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds a key legal/timing constraint I hadn’t explicitly incorporated: the 45–60 day legal window between dissolution/decree and election day. That sharply limits the usefulness of a pre–July 1 announcement if the target is an early-autumn election, and increases the odds that any formal decree would fall in July. I find that persuasive and it narrows the Yes pathways to late July/August elections, which are unattractive. Forecaster 3’s analysis appears to conflict with the assistant’s report that a new government won a confidence vote in mid-April; if that’s correct, the “decision within ten days” framing on May 14 seems inconsistent. F3 also implies a date could be set well ahead of autumn, which likely clashes with the 45–60 day requirement; that weakens their 40% case. Overall, F2’s legal mechanics and seasonality points strengthen the No baseline, while F3’s arguments rely on optionality that seems less credible given the reported cabinet confirmation.",
    "rationale": "Given the April confidence vote, the automatic snap-election trigger is gone, and the governing bloc presumably has a working majority. The resolution hinges on a formal, dated announcement before July 1. Because Serbian practice/law ties the presidential decree to a 45–60 day window, a formal pre–July 1 announcement would imply an election in late July or August—timing governments typically avoid due to turnout/logistics. That significantly reduces the incentive to announce before July 1 if the desired timing is September or later. While Serbia does have a strong precedent of frequent snap elections, we would likely need a shock (coalition rupture, major protests/scandal) to justify calling a mid-summer vote mere weeks after forming a new cabinet. I initially placed this as unlikely but possible (9%). Incorporating F2’s timing/legal constraint makes the Yes path narrower still. I therefore edge down slightly to 8%.",
