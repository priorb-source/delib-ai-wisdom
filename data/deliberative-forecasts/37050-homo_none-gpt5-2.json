    "review": "Both forecasters sharpened the base-rate framing and emphasized the short 67-day window. The ~0.6 events/year estimate translating to ~10% over two months is a helpful quantification and aligns with my qualitative sense. Their catalyst scan (no widely telegraphed splits/M&A; Boeing and 3M as watch items but with the committee’s tolerance for prolonged issues) matches my priors. No new concrete signals were introduced, but the disciplined reliance on base rates and recent 2024 adjustments is persuasive. I find their reasoning sound and marginally prefer their slightly lower baseline given the absence of visible triggers.",
    "rationale": "I anchor on the historical cadence: roughly 0.6 change events per year implies around 10% across a two-month horizon. I add a small premium for the fact that resolution is based on announcement (the committee can move abruptly, including late June), and for ongoing Boeing risk. Offsetting that, the index had a significant refresh in 2024, there are no credible reports of imminent changes, and no major corporate actions or splits among constituents that would force a representational fix. Netting these factors, I trim my prior 12% to 11%, staying close to base rate with a slight tail-risk cushion. Key upside movers: credible media reports of a DJIA reshuffle; acute deterioration at Boeing or a constituent’s major transaction/split. Downside movers: continued quiet through mid-to-late June without rumors or triggers.",
