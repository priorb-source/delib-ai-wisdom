    "review": "The deliberation revealed a significant spread in forecasts (85%, 75%, 35%), stemming from different interpretations of the base rate and, crucially, factors I had not considered. Forecaster 2's analysis (75%) was broadly similar to my own, anchoring on the December 2024 data of six cube-shaped reports and concluding a high likelihood, which served as a good sanity check on my initial reasoning. Forecaster 3's analysis (35%) was transformative for my thinking. They introduced two critical new variables: seasonality and posting lag. The seasonality argument—that June has more outdoor activity and thus potentially more sightings—is a plausible factor that would increase the probability. More importantly, the 'posting lag' argument—that a report from June might not be posted to the NUFORC website by the July 1st resolution deadline—is a crucial insight that directly addresses a constraint in the resolution criteria. This introduces a significant failure path that I had completely overlooked. Forecaster 3's skepticism about the base rate, viewing December 2024 as a potential outlier, also provides a healthy counterbalance to my heavy reliance on that single data point.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward from 85% to 70%. The primary driver for this change is Forecaster 3's point about NUFORC's posting lag. My initial analysis only considered the probability of a cube-shaped UFO being sighted and reported in June; it failed to account for the risk that the report would not be processed and published on the NUFORC website by the July 1st deadline specified in the resolution criteria. This represents a substantial, unquantified risk. A report filed in the last week of June, for instance, might easily not appear on the site in time. This factor alone warrants a notable decrease in my confidence.\n\nPartially offsetting this is Forecaster 3's other excellent point about seasonality. More daylight hours and better weather in June likely lead to more people being outdoors, which should increase the overall number of sightings compared to a winter month like December. Assuming the proportion of cube-shaped UFOs remains constant, this would increase the absolute number of expected cube reports, pushing the probability higher and counteracting some, but not all, of the negative effect of the posting lag.\n\nWhile I am lowering my forecast, I am not moving as low as Forecaster 3's 35%. I still believe the December 2024 data (six reports) is the strongest piece of recent evidence regarding the base rate for this specific shape. Dismissing it as a complete anomaly seems overly pessimistic. A 70% probability reflects a belief that a cube sighting is still quite likely to occur and be reported, but it now incorporates a significant 15-point discount from my original estimate to account for the very real risk that the operational realities of NUFORC's reporting schedule prevent a qualifying report from being posted in time.",
