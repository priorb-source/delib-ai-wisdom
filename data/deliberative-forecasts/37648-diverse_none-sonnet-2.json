    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises two critical points I underweighted: (1) INARA (Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act) requirements would likely trigger congressional review for any nuclear agreement, adding procedural delays incompatible with the 47-day timeline; (2) The complete absence of corroborating evidence beyond a single Israeli media report. Forecaster 3 also correctly notes that recent US-Iran patterns favor tacit de-escalation over formal 'agreements.' The semantic evasion argument is less compelling for resolution criteria, since the question explicitly requires an announced 'agreement.' Forecaster 2's analysis parallels mine but doesn't change my view significantly. Forecaster 3's procedural and evidentiary arguments are stronger than I initially appreciated, though I think 11% is slightly too pessimistic given the credibility of Israeli intelligence sources on this matter and the lower bar of 'announcement' versus full implementation.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I overweighted the Israeli media report and underweighted several crucial obstacles. The INARA point is particularly important - any substantive nuclear agreement would likely require congressional notification and potentially review, making a 47-day timeline extremely difficult. The research assistant's explicit 'no additional information' confirms we have only one data point. Historical patterns show US-Iran arrangements tend to be informal understandings rather than publicly announced 'agreements' to avoid domestic political costs on both sides. Supreme Leader/IRGC authority in Iran creates additional friction for rapid deal-making. However, I don't update as low as 11% because: the Israeli intelligence report from briefed senior ministers carries real weight and suggests potentially advanced secret negotiations; 'announcement' is a lower bar than full implementation; and both parties have strong crisis-avoidance incentives. Balancing Forecaster 3's excellent procedural skepticism against the non-trivial intelligence signal, I update downward to 17%.",
