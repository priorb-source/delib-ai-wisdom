    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 27 days (until June 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Rockies remain a bottom-5 team but another rebuilding club (e.g., White Sox, Athletics, Marlins, Nationals, Angels) has an equal or worse winning percentage on June 15, so Colorado does not have the sole or joint-lowest mark when the MLB standings are checked.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Over the next four weeks the Rockies hit a cold stretch (e.g., sub-.350 ball), their pitching staff continues to struggle, and a tough NL West slate suppresses wins. On June 15 they sit at the bottom of MLB by winning percentage (including ties for worst).",
    "rationale": "- Base rate: With 30 teams, a random team has ~3.3% chance to be the single worst on any given day. The Rockies’ true-talent outlook entering 2025 was among the league’s lowest, so their prior is materially above base rate, but they still face competition from several similarly weak teams.\n- Timing/variance: By June 15 most clubs will have played ~65–70 games. At that sample size, binomial variance is still large; differences of only 1–3 wins can separate several bottom teams. Even if Colorado is bottom-5 talent, the chance of being the single worst on that specific date is modest because at least 3–6 teams plausibly occupy last.\n- Competitor set: Likely relegation peers include the White Sox, Athletics (in Sacramento), Marlins, Nationals, and possibly the Angels. If one of these is truly dreadful, that reduces Colorado’s chance of being last; if the field is bunched, chances rise. Preseason projections generally had Rockies in the bottom tier but not clearly the worst, suggesting a mid–teens probability by June 15.\n- Status quo weighting: Without current standings in hand, the conservative default is that another team is currently in last and will likely remain in the mix for worst through mid-June, making “No” the status-quo outcome.\n- Ties: The prompt doesn’t specify tie handling, but MLB standings display ties. I assume a tie for the lowest percentage counts as “Yes.” If ties did not count, I’d trim a couple of points off this forecast.\n- Why not higher: Multiple comparably weak teams compete to be last; only ~4 weeks remain, and if another team is already several games worse, Colorado’s window to fall below them is short.\n- Why not lower: Rockies’ true talent is likely bottom tier; NL West competition is strong; a brief skid could easily push them to the very bottom given small win differentials.\n- What would move me up: Learning the Rockies are currently last or within ~1 game of last; significant new injuries or a very tough upcoming stretch; evidence that competitors have improved. In that case I’d raise to ~25–40% (higher if they’re already alone in last by multiple games).\n- What would move me down: Evidence they’re currently mid-pack or >3 games clear of the cellar; a softer schedule/run of form; or that another team is historically bad. That would push me to ~5–10%.\n- Research assistant summary: No additional info was provided; thus this forecast leans on priors, base rates, and general 2025 expectations for bottom-tier teams.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in the MLB on June 15, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMile High Sports: [The Colorado Rockies have lost a generation of fans](https://milehighsports.com/the-colorado-rockies-have-lost-a-generation-of-fans/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Colorado Rockies have the lowest winning percentage in Major League Baseball according to the [MLB official standings](https://www.mlb.com/standings/) when checked by Metaculus on or after June 15, 2025.\n\nNo other resolution source will be used to resolve the question. Question resolves based on how the page appears when checked by a Metaculus Admin.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
