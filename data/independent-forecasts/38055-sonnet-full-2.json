  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12 days. UFC 316 is scheduled for June 7, 2025, and today is May 26, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The fight proceeds as scheduled and one fighter defeats the other. The status quo suggests the bout will take place since it's currently on the card and both fighters appear healthy.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Either the fight is cancelled (due to injury, illness, or weight-cutting issues for either fighter) or the fight takes place but Pyfer loses to Gastelum via decision, knockout, or submission.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The fight proceeds as scheduled on June 7, 2025, and Joe Pyfer defeats Kelvin Gastelum by knockout, submission, or decision, earning a victory at UFC 316.",
    "rationale": "This forecast requires estimating two probabilities: (1) the fight actually happening, and (2) Pyfer winning if it does.\n\nFight occurrence probability (~85-90%): The bout has already been cancelled once when Pyfer withdrew due to illness from the Mexico card. However, with 12 days remaining, both fighters appear healthy and the fight is confirmed for the main card. There's still a 10-15% risk of late withdrawal due to injury, illness, or weight-cutting complications.\n\nPyfer's win probability if the fight happens (~55-60%): The research indicates Pyfer has significant momentum, winning 6 of his last 7 fights with a 4-1 UFC record. His recent first-round knockout of Barriault earning Performance of the Night demonstrates his finishing power. He holds physical advantages in grappling and reach. However, Gastelum is a seasoned veteran with 24 UFC appearances and won 2 of his last 3 fights. While Gastelum may be past his prime, his experience and The Ultimate Fighter 17 pedigree make him a legitimate threat.\n\nThe matchup appears relatively even with a slight edge to Pyfer based on recent form and physical advantages. Combined probability: 0.875 × 0.575 ≈ 50%.\n\nThis forecast isn't higher because: Gastelum remains a dangerous opponent with extensive octagon experience; MMA is inherently unpredictable; there's meaningful cancellation risk given the fight's history.\n\nThis forecast isn't lower because: Pyfer's recent performances show clear momentum; his physical advantages are notable; the fight appears likely to proceed.\n\nI would update higher if: News emerges of Gastelum struggling in training camp or having difficulty making weight; additional evidence of Pyfer's physical condition being excellent.\n\nI would update lower if: Reports of Pyfer having any health issues; Gastelum appearing in optimal condition; news suggesting the fight might be in jeopardy.",
