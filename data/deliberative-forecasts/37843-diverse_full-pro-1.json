    "review": "My initial forecast of 65% was a significant outlier compared to the other forecasters' 25% and 30%. Their analyses raised several critical points I had underweight. Forecaster 2 rightly emphasized that the two-plus months of silence since the March reports makes a near-term announcement less likely; the passage of time is evidence in itself. More importantly, Forecaster 3 introduced a crucial argument I had not fully considered: the mechanics of the IPO process, specifically the common practice of filing a *confidential* S-1. A confidential filing would allow Discord to be well advanced in its IPO preparations without triggering a 'Yes' resolution for this question. This single point provides a strong, plausible explanation for why the March reports could be accurate while a public announcement before July 1 remains unlikely. Forecaster 3's points about standard investment banking timelines, such as avoiding the July 4th holiday, further strengthen the case for a post-deadline announcement.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward from 65% to 30%. The reasoning provided by the other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 3, was highly convincing and exposed a key flaw in my initial analysis. I was too focused on the general likelihood of a 2025 IPO and did not give enough weight to the specific resolution criteria and the short timeframe. The high probability that Discord is utilizing a confidential S-1 filing process dramatically lowers the chance of a *public* filing before July 1, even if the company is on track for a listing later this year. The base case has shifted in my mind: the most likely scenario is now that Discord is preparing for an IPO privately and will only file its public S-1 after the July 1 deadline, perhaps in mid-to-late summer for a fall IPO. I am not lowering my forecast to zero because a public filing in June is still plausible if the company is targeting a late-July/early-August IPO or if market conditions suddenly become very favorable. However, the procedural hurdles and typical timelines make this a less likely outcome. My new forecast of 30% aligns with the consensus that a 'Yes' resolution is possible but improbable.",
