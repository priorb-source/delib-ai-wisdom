    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that have prompted me to reconsider my initial forecast. Forecaster 2 emphasizes a critical point I underweighted: Zelenskyy's public commitment is not just a statement of intent but an unambiguous declaration ('I will be') that raises the diplomatic cost of cancellation significantly. They correctly note this would require a 'truly exceptional event' to reverse. Forecaster 3 provides valuable perspective by noting the precedent of virtual attendance at 2 of the last 3 G7 summits, though they also acknowledge that his explicit commitment this time suggests different planning. Both forecasters appropriately weight the convergent signals: public commitment, host-nation security preparations, active international travel right now, and strategic imperatives. The key insight from both is that the bar for non-attendance is higher than I initially estimated given the clarity and recency of his commitment combined with demonstrated travel capability (he's in Vilnius on June 2, just 13-15 days before the summit). However, I appreciate that neither goes to 95%+, recognizing that 12-14 days in an active war context does preserve meaningful tail risk for unforeseen military, security, or logistical contingencies.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I believe I underweighted the strength of Zelenskyy's explicit public commitment and the convergent evidence supporting attendance. His May 27 statement 'I will be' is unambiguous and creates diplomatic commitments that raise the threshold for cancellation. The fact that he's actively traveling internationally right now (in Vilnius on June 2) demonstrates real-time capability and willingness just 13-15 days before the summit. Canadian security planning with no-fly zones indicates serious host-nation preparation assuming his presence. The strategic value of in-person G7 attendance for Ukraine is exceptionally high, especially given discussions on Russia sanctions. However, I maintain that 90% may be slightly overconfident. While Forecaster 3's point about virtual attendance in 2022 and 2024 is noted, those instances lacked this level of explicit commitment. The main risks remain: a major military crisis requiring his presence in Ukraine (5-7% probability), specific security threats (2-3%), or health/logistics issues (1-2%). These tail risks are real but limited. On balance, I'm updating upward to 87%, acknowledging the strength of the commitment and evidence while maintaining appropriate caution for a 12-14 day window in wartime conditions.",
