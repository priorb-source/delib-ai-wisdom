  "information": "A 17% 'reciprocal' tariff on Israeli goods was announced by the US on April 2, 2025, and codified under heading 9903.01.48 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) with an effective date of April 9. Subsequently, the implementation of this tariff was suspended for 90 days, deferring the collection of duties until July 9, 2025.

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the HTS currently shows a +17% duty for Israel (marked suspended) and suspension runs past June 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The administration rescinds or materially revises the measure before June 1 and the USITC HTS site is updated to remove or change the Israel rate so it no longer displays +17% in the applicable subheading(s).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "No policy change before June 1, so the HTS continues to list +17% for Israel (even if marked suspended). Alternatively, the tariff is implemented earlier than July 9, which would also leave +17% displayed.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: A 17% reciprocal tariff on Israeli goods was announced April 2, 2025 and added to the HTS under 9903.01.48 effective April 9. Implementation/collection is suspended for 90 days (until July 9). The official HTS site has already been updated to show “+17%” for Israel, currently flagged as “suspended.” The question explicitly states that suspension status does not affect resolution; only that the duty provided is +17% for Israel on or after June 1.\n- Status quo bias: Given the entry is already live and the suspension extends beyond June 1, the default is that the +17% line will remain visible on the HTS site through at least early June. USITC typically keeps such Chapter 99 entries posted unless and until a new proclamation/rule removes or alters them. That favors a Yes.\n- Paths to No: The main risk is a political/diplomatic reversal before June 1 (e.g., a negotiated deal where the U.S. revokes the measure and directs USITC to remove or amend 9903.01.48 so that +17% no longer appears for Israel), or a court action prompting removal/rewrite of the published rate. Timing matters: even if a decision is taken, the HTS must be updated before Metaculus checks the site on or after June 1.\n- Why not higher: There is meaningful uncertainty because the tariff was suspended to allow negotiation; that implies a non-trivial chance of rescission or material change before July 9. If such a decision comes in May and USITC promptly updates the HTS, the listing could be gone by June 1.\n- Why not lower: The measure is already codified and displayed. The suspension runs beyond June 1, reducing the incentive to remove the listing quickly. Frequent practice is to leave suspended measures visible with a suspension note rather than deleting them.\n- What would move me up: Confirmation from USTR/White House that the measure will remain on the books at least through July 9; USITC release notes indicating no HTS changes planned that would remove 9903.01.48 before June; late-May checks showing the entry still present.\n- What would move me down: Credible reports of a policy reversal or settlement pre–June 1; a presidential proclamation revoking or modifying the tariff; USITC preview/notice of HTS updates eliminating the 17% Israel line; court orders affecting the entry and prompting an immediate HTS revision.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Israel as 17% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of Israel: [Israeli exports to US will take annual $2.3B hit under tariffs, industrial org warns](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-exports-to-us-will-take-2-3-billion-hit-under-tariffs-industrialist-org-warns/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 17% for Israel at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=israel) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA 17% 'reciprocal' tariff on Israeli goods was announced by the US on April 2, 2025, and codified under heading 9903.01.48 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) with an effective date of April 9.

Reports state that the official HTS website has been updated to list a '+17%' duty for Israel, which is currently marked as 'suspended'.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
