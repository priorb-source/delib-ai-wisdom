  "information": "North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, with the last one occurring in September 2017. The current gap of over seven and a half years is the longest interval between tests. According to South Korea's National Intelligence Service (NIS), the tunnels at the Punggye-ri test site are maintained in an operational condition. The U.S. State Department also assesses that the site remains capable of supporting a seventh test. The IAEA has warned about an 'exponential' expansion of North Korea's nuclear program and ongoing plutonium production at the Yongbyon facility. However, analysis of satellite imagery by the think tank 38 North shows no new tunneling activity at Punggye-ri, and there are no public reports of specific preparations such as equipment movement or other logistical arrangements that would typically precede a test.\n\nIn late April 2025, North Korea conducted the first weapons system tests for its new 5,000-ton 'Choe Hyon-class' destroyer. The tests, observed by leader Kim Jong Un, included the launch of supersonic cruise missiles, strategic cruise missiles, and anti-aircraft missiles. The warship is expected to be delivered to the navy and enter service in early 2026. Earlier in 2025, North Korea conducted several other weapons tests. In April, it tested the 'Haeil-2' underwater attack drone. In February, it test-launched strategic cruise missiles. In January, it conducted its first missile test of the year, firing an intermediate-range ballistic missile with a hypersonic glide vehicle.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un has repeatedly called for strengthening the country's strategic forces. Following the destroyer weapon tests in April 2025, he stated, 'The time has come for North Korea's navy to choose to accelerate nuclear armament.' In January 2025, he said the country's nuclear weapons development program would continue 'indefinitely.' In February 2025, the US, South Korea, and Japan issued a joint statement confirming their trilateral partnership and calling for North Korea's complete nuclear disarmament, pledging to strengthen sanctions enforcement. The European Union condemned North Korea's ballistic missile launch in January 2025, calling it a violation of UN Security Council resolutions.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 61 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No test occurs; North Korea continues missile demonstrations and rhetoric without crossing the nuclear-test threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite maintaining Punggye-ri in test-capable condition, North Korea opts for lower-cost signaling (missile/cruise/drone tests, political statements) and delays a seventh nuclear test to a later symbolic date (e.g., after July) or until it sees greater strategic benefit. No clear preparatory activity is observed in commercial satellite imagery or flagged by allied intelligence.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kim orders a seventh nuclear test at Punggye-ri (likely Tunnel 3/4) to validate a new tactical/miniaturized or boosted design, potentially timed to a political anniversary (e.g., June 25). In the days to weeks prior, indicators such as vehicle activity, cable reels, and portal work may appear; CTBTO IMS then detects the seismic event and credible sources confirm the test.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo and signals: No nuclear test since September 2017, the longest gap on record. While ROK NIS and the U.S. State Department assess Punggye-ri remains capable and the IAEA notes expanding nuclear activity, 38 North reports no new tunneling or specific pre-test logistics. Historically, visible indicators often precede DPRK tests by days to weeks. With only ~2 months left, the absence of such signals weighs toward No.\n- Incentives cutting both ways: Constraints from UNSC action are weaker than in the past (given Russia/China posture), which modestly raises the hazard. DPRK has ramped conventional and missile tests in 2025 and escalatory rhetoric (including naval nuclearization), suggesting technical ambitions that a live test could support. Conversely, Pyongyang can gain much of the signaling benefit via frequent non-nuclear tests at lower cost, and may prefer a more salient future date outside this window.\n- Timing considerations: Spring exercises are over; a plausible near-term ‘hook’ is the June 25 Korean War anniversary. That keeps a non-trivial tail risk within the window, even if current imagery lacks telltales.\n- Why not higher: No proximate preparatory signs; short time remaining; DPRK repeatedly refrained despite apparent readiness since 2022.\n- Why not lower: The site is operable; program expansion continues; penalties are limited; DPRK can move from preparation to detonation quickly, and political timing (e.g., June 25) exists.\n- Watch for updates: I would raise the probability on credible reports or imagery showing vehicles/cable reels at portals, water pumping/sealing activity, fresh spoil, or allied intel warnings of an imminent test; also if DPRK state media cues a major ‘strategic’ step. I would lower it if imagery shows dormancy/dismantlement, strong public pressure from China/Russia, or signs of renewed diplomatic engagement that DPRK seems to value in the short run.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
