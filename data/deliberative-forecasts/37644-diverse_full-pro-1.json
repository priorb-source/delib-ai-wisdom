    "review": "All three forecasters agree on the primary evidence: Anthropic is well-funded after a March 2025 round, there are no public signals of IPO preparation (e.g., reports of hiring banks or S-1 filing rumors), the base rate for such an event is low, and the deadline is very soon. The main point of divergence is the probability assigned to a 'surprise' announcement. Forecaster 2's analysis, at 3%, aligns perfectly with my own initial reasoning, providing strong confirmation for this forecast level. Forecaster 3, at 8%, argues that a company can prepare an IPO quietly and that strategic needs or employee liquidity could be drivers. While I acknowledge these as theoretical possibilities, I find Forecaster 3's arguments unconvincing in this specific case. For a company of Anthropic's size and profile (~$61.5B valuation), a completely secret IPO preparation process involving numerous bankers, lawyers, and accountants is extremely improbable. The total absence of leaks in major financial media is a very strong negative signal. Furthermore, the massive March funding round likely included a secondary component that would have recently provided liquidity to employees and early investors, reducing that as a near-term pressure point.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am maintaining my initial probability of 3%. The consensus on the strong evidence against an imminent IPO announcement reinforces my view. This evidence includes the very recent and substantial $3.5 billion funding round in March 2025, which provides a long operational runway and negates any urgent need for capital. It also includes the complete lack of preparatory signals—no credible reports from Bloomberg, Reuters, or the Wall Street Journal about Anthropic engaging underwriters or confidentially filing an S-1 form. Given the short timeframe of approximately six weeks until the resolution date, the absence of these precursors is highly significant. The analysis from Forecaster 2 mirrors my own and strengthens my confidence. I am not increasing my forecast to align with Forecaster 3's 8% because I believe it overweights the possibility of a surprise announcement. While a confidential filing could theoretically be revealed without prior rumors, the scale of a potential Anthropic IPO makes a complete information lockdown highly unlikely. The arguments for other drivers like employee liquidity are also weakened by the timing of the recent funding round. My 3% forecast appropriately reflects that an announcement is a very low-probability event, while still allowing for a small chance of an unexpected corporate maneuver in this dynamic sector.",
