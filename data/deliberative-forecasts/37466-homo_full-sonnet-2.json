    "review": "All three forecasters converged on similar key factors and a tight probability range (23-30%). Forecaster 2 and 3 both emphasize important points I considered but didn't fully elaborate: (1) the technical ease of web content changes, and (2) the article title change as potential signal of willingness to update. However, I believe we all share the core insight that the 3.5+ month gap between the article title change and map non-update is crucial evidence.\n\nForecaster 3's point that 'web content can be changed quickly' is valid but cuts both ways - if it's so easy to change, why haven't they done it in 3.5 months? Forecaster 2's framing of 'deliberate wait-and-see approach' and emphasis on 'status quo bias' aligns well with my interpretation. The key disagreement is subtle: whether the article title change indicates future map updating or represents their final compromise position.\n\nI find the evidence strongly supports the latter interpretation. The separation of article title acknowledgment from map display appears intentional - they're acknowledging the controversy without committing to cartographic change. This is exactly what a cautious, international publisher would do when facing a politically controversial, non-consensus name change. If they intended to update the map, the logical time was when they updated the article title.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I maintain that the 3.5-month delay between article title acknowledgment and map non-update is the strongest signal of WorldAtlas's intentions. The article title change to 'Gulf Of Mexico (Gulf of America)' combined with unchanged map display suggests they've deliberately chosen a middle-ground editorial position rather than planning a full map update.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the technical ease of web changes and the 54 remaining days (Forecaster 3's points), these factors are outweighed by the revealed preference through inaction. A Canadian-based international publisher facing a controversial, non-consensus name change has shown their hand: acknowledge in articles, maintain traditional names on maps.\n\nThe lack of movement from other major international mapping services (National Geographic, Apple) and absence of International Hydrographic Organization recognition further supports maintaining the status quo on maps. Google's change is location-specific and doesn't indicate broader industry movement.\n\nI'm making a minimal upward adjustment to 25% to acknowledge (1) the non-zero possibility of late-breaking change given remaining time, and (2) slight uncertainty about whether internal editorial discussions could shift their position. But the evidence pattern remains strongly weighted toward No.",
