  "information": "Libya's Economy and Trade Minister, Muhammed Huveyc, announced in May 2025 that the country aims to increase its trade volume with Turkey from $3.7 billion to $10 billion. To facilitate this, joint committees have been established to address issues such as the return of Turkish companies to projects in Libya and the resolution of bank guarantees. The two countries are also working towards eliminating taxes and establishing a free trade zone, with the stated goal of using Libya's strategic location to facilitate the transport of Turkish industrial products to the broader African market.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Two months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Libya has signed but not yet ratified the agreement. The country's deep political divisions and legislative gridlock make swift action on major international treaties highly improbable.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The deadline of July 1, 2025, passes without Libya completing its domestic legislative process and depositing the instrument of ratification. Political factions remain deadlocked, and bureaucratic attention is diverted to the bilateral trade negotiations with Turkey, leaving the AfCFTA ratification on the back burner.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Libyan Economy and Trade Ministry, energized by the prospect of becoming a trade hub for Turkish goods, successfully frames AfCFTA ratification as a critical and urgent step. A key political faction manages to build a consensus to fast-track the legislation, and Libya deposits its instrument of ratification in a surprise move to signal its readiness for pan-African trade.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the 'No' outcome due to three main factors. First, the status quo is that Libya has failed to ratify the agreement for years amidst political fragmentation and conflict; the default assumption should be a continuation of this inaction. Second, the timeframe of two months is extremely short for any nation to pass and formalize a major international treaty, let alone one with Libya's well-documented legislative paralysis. Third, the new information about deepening trade ties with Turkey is a double-edged sword. While it signals a desire for increased trade, it also introduces a major bilateral negotiation that will consume significant political and bureaucratic capital. It is more likely to be a distraction from the multilateral AfCFTA in the short term than a catalyst for it.\n\nMy probability is not lower (i.e., closer to 0%) because the report does indicate a high-level political will for expanding trade, and the minister involved might see AfCFTA ratification as a 'quick win' to complement the Turkish initiative. There is a small but non-zero chance that the groundwork has already been laid, and a rapid political push could finalize the process.\n\nMy probability is not higher because this 'Yes' scenario requires a level of political unity and efficiency that has been absent in Libya for over a decade. The structural barriers to ratification are immense and are highly unlikely to be overcome in just two months.\n\nI would update my forecast towards 'Yes' upon news of the ratification bill being tabled in a legislative body with broad support. I would update towards 'No' if there are renewed outbreaks of political infighting or if officials explicitly state the Turkish deal is a priority over AfCFTA.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Libya ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [African Continental Free Trade Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Continental_Free_Trade_Area)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Libya ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nLibya's Economy and Trade Minister, Muhammed Huveyc, announced in May 2025 that the country aims to increase its trade volume with Turkey from $3.7 billion to $10 billion.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
