    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short window, the importance of scheduled governance meetings for host awards, and the lack of any official ITKF signal—points aligned with my initial take. Forecaster 2 adds the risk that the host may already be chosen (or that decisions are slated later) and highlights communications lags that could delay a public announcement even if a decision is made. Forecaster 3 underscores base-rate reasoning tied to federations aligning decisions with congresses and the plausibility—but not likelihood—of a quick move in smaller federations. No one presents new concrete evidence, but their emphasis on institutional timing and announcement lags is persuasive and nudges me slightly lower.",
    "rationale": "Key factors remain: roughly seven weeks to the deadline; the requirement for an explicit ITKF announcement; and no official signals (agenda, congress date, or teaser) indicating an imminent decision. The cited article reflects interest (“discussed hosting”) rather than a concluded selection, and there’s added ambiguity between “World Cup” vs. “World Championship” plus federation fragmentation in traditional karate (ITKF vs. others). These elevate the bar for a qualifying announcement by July 1. A fast-track outcome is possible—government backing and a smaller federation could allow a late-May/June executive decision and announcement—but absent any visible pipeline, the base case is no announcement in time. I’m trimming my forecast from 24% to 22% to reflect the other forecasters’ emphasis on governance calendars and communication lag risk, without any offsetting positive signals since my initial view.",
