    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most important new consideration: the multiplicative risk of requiring ALL seven countries to remain listed. The specific concern about Venezuela's 'intermittent' blocking pattern is crucial - if Wikipedia editors could legitimately reclassify it based on existing sources without a formal policy change, this creates risk I underweighted. The distinction between 'intermittent' and 'currently' blocking is a real editorial judgment call that could shift within 26 days. Forecaster 3 also correctly identifies Russia as a secondary vulnerability given its more recent (2022) block compared to the 16-year blocks in China/Iran. Forecaster 2's 97% seems slightly overconfident given these risks, though their 'dual inertia' framework is sound. However, I think Forecaster 3's 75% may be too pessimistic about the speed of Wikipedia consensus formation. For Venezuela to be removed, editors would need: (1) reliable sources showing sustained unblocking, (2) consensus discussion, and (3) implementation - all within 26 days. Even if blocks are intermittent, the default would be maintaining the current listing absent clear evidence of change. The admin discretion clause in resolution criteria also protects against hasty editorial changes.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating downward but not as far as Forecaster 3. The key insights are: (1) Requiring ALL seven countries multiplicatively increases risk - if Venezuela has 90% probability and Russia 95%, that alone brings the combined probability to ~85% before considering the others. (2) Venezuela's intermittent blocking history creates legitimate editorial ambiguity that could result in reclassification without formal policy change. (3) The 26-day timeframe, while short, isn't zero-risk for Wikipedia editing changes. However, I'm not going as low as 75% because: (1) Wikipedia consensus typically requires clear sourcing and discussion time, making rapid changes unlikely. (2) The current listing represents existing consensus that would need active reversal, not just expiry. (3) Admin discretion protects against edge cases. (4) Even 'intermittent' blocks in Venezuela would likely maintain the 'currently' designation without evidence of sustained, recent unblocking. My updated forecast weights the Venezuela risk more heavily (~92% it stays listed) and Russia slightly lower (~96%), with the other five near-certain (~99%+), yielding a combined probability around 88%.",
