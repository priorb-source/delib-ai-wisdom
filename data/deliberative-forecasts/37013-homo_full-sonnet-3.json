    "review": "All three analyses converge on the fundamental challenge: the Liberal Democrats face an unprecedented 31-seat deficit with no historical precedent for winning plurality control. Forecaster 2 makes valid points about traditional Lib Dem strength in Southwest local elections and the exceptional nature of current political volatility, justifying their 15% forecast. Forecaster 3 emphasizes critical constraints I underweighted: that Reform UK historically underperforms in local versus national elections (suggesting Conservative vote may be stickier than national polling implies), and that local elections see votes dissipate to independents rather than consolidating behind one opposition party. This second point is particularly important - even total Conservative collapse doesn't guarantee Lib Dem gains if votes fragment across Reform, Labour, Greens, and multiple independents. Forecaster 2's higher forecast acknowledges the exceptional moment, but I find Forecaster 3's structural analysis of vote fragmentation more compelling for why even favorable conditions likely won't produce a Lib Dem plurality.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm maintaining my 10% forecast. While Forecaster 2 correctly identifies Lib Dem strength in Southwest local elections and the exceptional political moment, these factors don't overcome the fundamental mathematical barrier: the required swing from 13 to 35-44 seats (depending on final distribution) remains unprecedented in Cornwall Council history. Forecaster 3's crucial insight about vote dissipation in local elections strengthens the case for 10% rather than 15% - even if Conservatives collapse from 44 seats, those votes will fragment across Reform UK, independents, Labour, Greens, and Lib Dems, not consolidate behind a single opposition party. Additionally, Reform UK's tendency to underperform in local elections versus national polling suggests the Conservative base may be more resilient locally than 22% national approval implies. The convergence between Forecaster 3 and myself at 10% reflects appropriate skepticism about an outcome with no historical precedent requiring extraordinary circumstances to align perfectly. I'm not updating lower because the genuine Conservative weakness and organizational disarray (retiring leader, strong Lib Dem organizing) do create non-zero possibility. I'm not updating higher because the structural barriers emphasized by Forecaster 3 outweigh the 'exceptional moment' argument from Forecaster 2.",
