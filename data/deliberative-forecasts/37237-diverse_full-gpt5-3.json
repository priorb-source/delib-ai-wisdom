    "review": "Both forecasters make a strong case for No driven by March front‑loading and broad high‑frequency evidence of a sharp April slowdown. The additional argument they raise that resonates most is how tight the threshold is: April needs to be within ~1.2% of the March record to resolve Yes, which is a high bar given the policy shock. However, I do not find the back‑of‑the‑envelope inference from $16.5B in tariff revenue to total import value persuasive. Customs duties only apply to the dutiable subset of goods, not services; there are timing issues (entries/FTZ/bonded warehouses), pre‑existing tariff lines, and heterogeneous rates (some far above 10%). Also, container‑based indicators (Project44, Drewry, LA/LB arrivals) omit bulk commodities (notably petroleum) and can under‑represent land and air modes. That said, the multi‑source, directionally consistent evidence of a marked April goods pullback, combined with the narrow gap versus March, strengthens the No case beyond my prior estimate.",
    "rationale": "Key points retained: March’s record suggests significant front‑running; tariffs began April 1 and Census import values exclude duties; services imports likely remain steadier and cushion but cannot fully offset a sizable goods decline. New considerations emphasized by others: the very small margin needed to fall below the threshold and the breadth of early‑April softness across independent logistics sources. I discount attempts to back‑solve imports from tariff revenue, but I do take the revenue as qualitative evidence that sizable dutiable flows persisted (just not enough to imply a near‑record total). Container metrics likely overstate the fall in total goods due to exclusion of bulk petroleum and land modes, yet even a moderate goods drop (>3–5% m/m from March) would likely push total below $338.5B given services stability. Given the weight of indicators and the post‑front‑run air pocket, I lower my odds for a narrow beat but keep some probability for pipeline shipments, strong services, bulk energy, and Mexico/Canada land trade mitigating the drop more than feared.",
