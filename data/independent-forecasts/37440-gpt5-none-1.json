    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~8 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Florida keeps current practice (attestation of citizenship at registration with back-end database checks; no new voter-supplied documentary proof required).",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 2025 regular session adjourned without passing a proof-of-citizenship requirement, and no special session is called (or, if called, this item is excluded or stalls). Alternatively, lawmakers pass only back-end verification measures that do not expressly require any voters to provide documentary proof (thus not meeting the question’s criterion).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A bill like HB 831 passes both chambers and is signed by Gov. DeSantis before July 1, 2025, requiring some subset of voters (e.g., first-time registrants, voters flagged by databases, or mail-ballot applicants) to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship beyond current requirements.",
    "rationale": "- Timing/legislative process: Florida’s regular session in odd-numbered years typically runs ~60 days from early March to early May. As of May 6, 2025, the regular session is likely at or just past Sine Die. If this did not clear both chambers during the regular session, the remaining path is a special session before July 1, which is possible but uncommon for a standalone elections policy. This timing weighs toward No by default.\n- Politics: Florida has a Republican trifecta and a governor likely to sign such a bill, and 2025 has seen national GOP advocacy for proof-of-citizenship measures. That raises the prior relative to a purple-state baseline and keeps the probability from being too low.\n- Legal/feasibility constraints: Proof-of-citizenship at registration raises NVRA preemption issues (as seen in Arizona/Kansas litigation). Florida legislators may prefer database-driven verification rather than requiring voters to present documents, especially late in session. If the Legislature opts for enhanced agency checks without a voter-supplied proof mandate, this would not meet the question’s bar.\n- Bill status uncertainty: The cited Tallahassee Democrat article (Apr 2, 2025) suggests active consideration near the end of session. Late-introduced or controversial measures often face calendar and committee bottlenecks in Florida’s fast session. Without confirmation it passed by Sine Die, base rates suggest it likely did not.\n- Enactment requirement: The question resolves on enactment (passage + governor’s signature), not effective date or litigation. If it already passed in the final days, signing could occur in May/June, yielding a Yes. I allocate some weight to that possibility.\n- Research assistant info: None available beyond the article reference (“No additional information available”), so I rely on institutional timelines, political control, and base rates.\nWhy not higher: Session likely ended; legal/political caution in the Senate; special session before July 1 focused on this issue is unlikely. Why not lower: Strong GOP control, gubernatorial support, and national pressure increase the chance it either already passed at session’s end or could be fast-tracked in a brief special session.\nUpdates that would move the forecast up: Confirmation that HB 831 or a companion cleared both chambers; placement on the governor’s desk; governor or legislative leaders announce a special session including this item; credible reporting that leadership made this a priority. Updates that would move it down: Credible reports it died in committee or was not taken up; leadership explicitly deprioritizes it; special session, if any, excludes elections policy.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Florida enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nTallahassee Democrat: [Florida may require proof of citizenship to vote under new legislation echoing Trump](https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/local/state/2025/04/02/got-id-proof-of-citizenship-may-soon-be-needed-to-vote-in-florida/82756919007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Florida enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [HB 831](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2025/831). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-06.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
