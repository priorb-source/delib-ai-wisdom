    "review": "Forecaster 2 and 3 present dramatically different assessments (70% vs 12%), which highlights significant uncertainty about the current state of negotiations. Forecaster 2 claims an IMF mission is currently in Beirut with a draft $3B EFF, suggesting advanced negotiations - but this specific claim is not in the research assistant's report, raising questions about its sourcing. Forecaster 3 provides superior technical analysis, identifying specific unresolved reforms (bank-restructuring law, capital controls, governance structure) and crucially noting that IMF characterizes progress as 'slow.' Forecaster 3's point about IMF procedural timelines is particularly compelling - even with technical agreement, staff-level approval, LOI/MEFP finalization, and Board approval typically take weeks. I initially overweighted the June 10 meeting as a catalyst, but this is actually for the World Bank LEAP project, not IMF negotiations. My original 40% forecast insufficiently accounted for these procedural barriers and the technical complexity of outstanding reforms in a 32-day window.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both forecasts, I find Forecaster 3's technical analysis more convincing and well-grounded. The specific identification of incomplete reforms, IMF's own 'slow progress' assessment, and realistic process timeline constraints are persuasive arguments I underweighted. However, I don't adopt Forecaster 3's 12% entirely because: (1) President Aoun's explicit pre-summer deadline creates genuine political urgency, (2) the EU's 500M euro conditional aid provides extraordinary external leverage, (3) crisis situations occasionally produce rapid policy breakthroughs that bypass normal timelines, and (4) there remain scenarios where a preliminary announcement could occur even if full Board approval falls after July 1. Forecaster 2's optimism seems insufficiently justified given the procedural hurdles and lack of verification for claimed active negotiations. I'm updating significantly downward from 40% to 22%, reflecting greater realism about technical barriers while maintaining some probability for politically-driven breakthrough scenarios.",
