    "review": "All three analyses converged on remarkably similar probabilities through independent reasoning, which is a strong signal of sound methodology. Forecaster 2 and I both estimated 87% for fight occurrence and 60% for Pyfer winning if it happens, arriving at 52%. Forecaster 3 estimated 85-90% and 55-60%, arriving at 50%. This consensus reflects similar assessment of key factors: Pyfer's momentum and physical advantages versus Gastelum's veteran experience, balanced against the meaningful risk of fight cancellation. No new information was raised that I hadn't considered. However, reviewing my own analysis, my 54% forecast included a speculative ~2% adjustment for the possibility of a late replacement opponent that Pyfer might defeat. Upon reflection, this adjustment is unjustified - if Gastelum withdraws at 12 days out, the fight would more likely be cancelled entirely rather than proceed with an unknown replacement, and we have no basis to estimate Pyfer's odds against a hypothetical replacement. This was overcorrection on my part.",
    "rationale": "The strong consensus among all three forecasters validates the core probability estimates: approximately 87% chance the fight occurs (given proximity to event, both fighters appearing healthy, but accounting for Pyfer's previous withdrawal history and general UFC cancellation rates) and approximately 58-60% chance Pyfer wins if it happens (balancing his strong recent form, physical advantages, and momentum against Gastelum's extensive experience and recent wins). Combined: 0.87 × 0.58 = 50.5%. I am removing my speculative 2% adjustment for a replacement fighter scenario, as this lacks justification. The convergence of three independent analyses on 50-52% provides additional confidence that this range appropriately reflects the balance of factors. I'm adjusting down from 54% to 52% to align with the consensus and remove the unjustified speculation.",
