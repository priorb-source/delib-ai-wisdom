    "status_quo_outcome": "Ramzan Kadyrov remains the Head of the Chechen Republic on June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following his public statement about wanting to step down, Kadyrov receives public appeals to stay in power from Chechen elites and citizens. Shortly after, he announces his decision to continue serving, citing his duty to his people and the Russian Federation, a pattern consistent with his similar statements in the past. He remains in his position past the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Persistent rumors about Kadyrov's failing health prove true. He suffers a severe medical crisis that leads to his death or complete incapacitation, formally ending his rule before June 1, 2025. Alternatively, his statement is the first step in a pre-arranged and rapid succession plan approved by the Kremlin, and his replacement is officially installed within the timeframe.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 10% is primarily based on the strong precedent of the status quo. Ramzan Kadyrov has been head of the Chechen Republic since 2007 and is a critical pillar of Vladimir Putin's control over the North Caucasus. The world generally changes slowly, and the unseating of such an entrenched leader is a low-probability event in any short timeframe. The key piece of information provided, Kadyrov's statement about wanting to step down, must be viewed in context. He has made nearly identical statements in 2017, 2018, and 2022, only to remain in power each time. These events are widely interpreted as political theater designed to reaffirm his loyalty to the Kremlin, gauge support, and extract concessions. This historical pattern is the strongest evidence for the high probability of a 'No' outcome.\n\nHowever, the probability is not lower than 10% due to significant and persistent rumors regarding Kadyrov's severe health problems, reportedly related to kidney failure. Unlike previous instances, this statement comes against a backdrop of credible speculation about his physical incapacitation. A sudden health crisis leading to his death or removal from office is the most plausible scenario for a 'Yes' resolution. This is a significant source of uncertainty that elevates the probability above a near-zero forecast.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 10% because the timeframe is extremely short (19 days). Even if a succession is being planned, the political maneuvering required to install a successor and ensure stability in a region as volatile as Chechnya would likely take longer. The most probable scenario remains that this is another publicity stunt. I would increase my forecast significantly if there were credible, independent reports confirming a life-threatening medical emergency or if a successor was publicly named by the Kremlin. Conversely, I would lower my forecast if Kadyrov appeared in public looking healthy and vigorous, or if he made a definitive statement about staying in power.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ramzan Kadyrov cease to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Moscow Times: [Kadyrov Says He Wants to Step Down as Chechen Leader](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/06/kadyrov-says-he-wants-to-step-down-as-chechen-leader-a88991)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) Ramzan Kadyrov ceases to be the [Head of the Chechen Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_the_Chechen_Republic) before June 1, 2025, for any reason. Otherwise, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
