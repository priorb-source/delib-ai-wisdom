  "information": "Recent economic indicators point to a weak economic outlook for the Eurozone. Real GDP growth forecasts for 2025 have been subject to downward revisions. For ten consecutive months, the composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI), which tracks business activity, has remained below or near the 50-point threshold separating contraction from expansion. The ECB's Wage Tracker Index indicates a rapid deceleration in wage increases from the peak observed in late 2024. This trend is expected to reduce price pressures in the labor-intensive services sector. Other disinflationary drivers include easing food inflation and a negative year-on-year contribution from energy prices.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-5 days. Eurozone inflation data for April 2025 is typically released in early May, and since today is April 28, 2025, the official announcement should occur within the next few days.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - inflation remains at or below 2.2%. The established trend shows downward pressure on inflation with multiple disinflationary forces at work.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "April inflation comes in at 2.2% or below, continuing the downward trend seen in recent months. Weak economic activity, decelerating wage growth, subdued energy prices, and easing food inflation keep overall price pressures contained below the threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unexpected spike in energy prices in April, combined with persistent services inflation or supply disruptions in food commodities, pushes the inflation rate above 2.2% despite the broader disinflationary trend.",
    "rationale": "The research assistant's report presents compelling evidence for continued disinflationary pressure in the Eurozone: (1) Ten consecutive months of PMI readings below or near 50 indicate persistent economic weakness and subdued demand, (2) Rapid deceleration in wage growth from late 2024 peaks reduces price pressures in the labor-intensive services sector, (3) Easing food inflation and negative year-on-year energy price contributions are active disinflationary drivers, (4) GDP growth forecasts have been revised downward. The March article about February inflation experiencing downward revisions reinforces this trend. Since we are only days away from the official April data release, the actual inflation outcome has already occurred - we're simply awaiting the official announcement. The data collection period is complete. Given the overwhelming evidence of disinflationary forces and weak economic fundamentals, the baseline expectation strongly favors inflation remaining below 2.2%. My forecast is not lower (closer to 5-10%) because: there remains inherent uncertainty in economic data, volatile components like energy can surprise, and without the preliminary April flash estimate, I maintain modest uncertainty. My forecast is not higher (30%+) because: the disinflationary trend is well-established across multiple indicators, economic weakness is broad-based and persistent, and all major inflation components show downward pressure. To update my forecast higher, I would need: evidence of an unexpected energy price spike in April, signs of demand-pull inflation contradicting the PMI readings, or preliminary data suggesting upward pressure. To update lower, I would need: preliminary flash estimates showing inflation well below 2.2%, or additional evidence of accelerating disinflation in April.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
