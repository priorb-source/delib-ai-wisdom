    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "39 days (from April 23, 2025 to June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No additional payment is made",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Zimbabwe does not make any additional compensation payments to white farmers under the 2020 Global Compensation Deed before June 1, 2025. The government may cite budget constraints, administrative delays in processing claims, or simply not have scheduled another payment within this short 39-day window. The April 9 payment could have been an initial symbolic gesture with future payments planned on a quarterly or semi-annual basis.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Zimbabwe makes at least one more payment to former farmers covered under the 2020 Global Compensation Deed before June 1, 2025. This could occur if payments are scheduled monthly (with another due in early-to-mid May), if the government is accelerating disbursements to demonstrate good faith to international creditors and donors, or if there's political pressure to show progress on the compensation agreement before a specific milestone or meeting.",
    "rationale": "The key factors in this forecast are timing and uncertainty about payment schedules. Zimbabwe made its first compensation payment of $3.1 million just two weeks ago (April 9, 2025), which is a positive signal that the payment mechanism is operational and the government is following through on commitments. The article indicates Zimbabwe is 'reaffirming commitment,' suggesting ongoing engagement. However, we face significant uncertainty: my research assistant provided no information about whether payments are scheduled monthly, quarterly, or on an ad-hoc basis. The 39-day window is relatively short for government payment processes, which tend to be slow and bureaucratic. The small size of the first payment ($3.1 million) suggests this is part of a larger, multi-payment compensation scheme, but doesn't indicate the pace of future disbursements. Zimbabwe faces severe economic challenges which could delay payments. Favoring the forecast toward the lower end: (1) extremely short timeframe, (2) status quo bias - governments rarely move this quickly between payments, (3) only two weeks since last payment, (4) no evidence of a rapid payment schedule. Preventing the forecast from being even lower: (1) the payment system is now demonstrably operational, (2) public commitment suggests more payments coming, (3) possible monthly schedule would yield a May payment, (4) international pressure for debt sustainability may incentivize regular payments. I would update higher with evidence of monthly payment schedules, imminent disbursement announcements, or international funding tranches. I would update lower with evidence of quarterly schedules, budget crises, or reports that next payment is scheduled after June 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Zimbabwe, before June 1, 2025, make another payment to white farmers whose property was seized?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Zimbabwe reaffirms commitment to land compensation to spur growth, debt sustainability](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/04/10/zimbabwe-reaffirms-commitment-to-land-compensation-to-spur-growth-debt-sustainability)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) the government of Zimbabwe after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 makes an additional payment to former farmers covered under the 2020 Global Compensation Deed.\n\nOn April 9, 2025, Zimbabwe [was reported](https://nehandaradio.com/2025/04/09/zimbabwe-pays-us3-1m-to-former-white-farmers-as-part-of-land-compensation-deal/) to have made its first compensation payment, of USD $3.1 million. Additional such disbursements made after the launch of this question and before June 1, 2025 would count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
