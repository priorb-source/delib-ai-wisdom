    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. Forecaster 2's analysis at 12% appears to be based on a fundamental misreading of the provided research. They operate under the assumption that we are forecasting the likelihood of a *new* 17% tariff being implemented, ignoring the research assistant's key finding that this tariff has already been announced, codified, and reportedly posted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) website (albeit as 'suspended'). Their reasoning is therefore unconvincing as it misses the core premise of the question. Forecaster 3's analysis at 62% is much more aligned with the facts. They correctly identify the core tension: the announced tariff versus the potential for a negotiated reversal before the resolution date. I found their introduction of 'mechanics uncertainty'—the idea that we can't be 100% certain the HTS website will show the suspended tariff on June 1st, even if codified—to be a valuable point I had not fully considered. They also correctly frame the 'negotiation risk' as the primary path to a 'No' outcome. While I find their reasoning sound, I believe they underweight the power of bureaucratic inertia and the lack of urgency created by the July 9th effective date.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 90% was based on a strong interpretation of the research assistant's report, specifically that the 17% tariff was already codified *and* listed on the HTS website. Under this assumption, the status quo leads to a 'Yes' outcome, and an active diplomatic and bureaucratic intervention would be required for a 'No'. After reviewing the other forecasts, I am adjusting my confidence slightly downward. Forecaster 3's analysis rightly points out two key sources of uncertainty I had somewhat discounted: 1) 'Mechanics uncertainty': The phrasing 'Reports state that the official HTS website has been updated' is not the same as direct confirmation. There's a small but non-zero chance these reports are premature or that the posting is not yet stable, and the USITC might wait until closer to the July effective date to make the change permanent. 2) 'Negotiation risk': While I still believe that a diplomatic agreement *and* the subsequent administrative action to remove the listing from the HTS are unlikely to be completed before June 1, Forecaster 3's argument persuades me to assign a slightly higher probability to this scenario. The existence of the 90-day suspension window is specifically to allow for such a deal. However, I maintain a high forecast because the path of least resistance remains a 'Yes' resolution. The tariff is officially on the books, and inaction is all that is required. The suspension until July reduces the political pressure for an immediate resolution before our June 1 deadline. I am therefore lowering my forecast from 90% to 85% to incorporate the valid points of uncertainty raised by Forecaster 3, which temper my initial conviction but do not fundamentally alter my view that a 'Yes' outcome is the most probable.",
