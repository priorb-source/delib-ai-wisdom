  "information": "In late May 2025, President Trump granted clemency to a large group of individuals. News outlets including The Hill and Politomix reported on May 28-29 that over two dozen people received pardons or commutations in what was described as a 'clemency spree' or 'blitz'. According to Office of the Pardon Attorney data, there were approximately 25 clemency actions in May. The recipients included political allies like former Congressman Michael Grimm and former Connecticut governor John G. Rowland, reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, and musicians such as NBA YoungBoy.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1 month (until June 30, 2025), plus a short reporting lag for public disclosure.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "After the late-May clemency spree, the White House imposes a pause for June—either zero actions or only one or two individualized grants—deferring the next batch to July or later due to backlash, staffing/ vetting bottlenecks, or a desire to regroup.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Another clemency batch in June (e.g., a Juneteenth-themed package, additional allies, or a narrow blanket action) results in at least 3 publicly disclosed grants; even a small follow-on list suffices.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence: The research assistant reports a late-May “clemency spree” exceeding two dozen actions, including high-profile names, and OPA data near ~25 May actions. That demonstrates both willingness and operational capacity to process multiple grants. The bar for June is low (>2). Juneteenth (June 19) is a plausible focal date for criminal-justice-themed clemency. \n- Status quo weighting: Given a fresh May burst, the default is continued clemency activity rather than a full stop; the world tends to change gradually. Thus, the status quo points to at least a small number in June.\n- Why not higher: There are real downside risks. After a high-profile blitz, the White House may pause to manage political blowback and messaging, to complete additional vetting, or to bunch actions into larger, less frequent packages—yielding ≤2 in June. Also, if the administration keys to symbolic dates, they might skip June and schedule the next tranche for July.\n- Why not lower: The threshold is very low (only 3+). The May operational tempo suggests the machinery is active; even limited, targeted follow-ups could easily exceed two. Trump’s incentives to reward constituencies and maintain momentum, plus the Juneteenth hook, push odds above even.\n- What would move me up: Credible reporting/leaks of an impending June package; WH/OPA communications or press guidance tied to Juneteenth; continued drips of names under review; signals of blanket or category-based actions.\n- What would move me down: Explicit signals of a pause; senior aides indicating no more clemencies until later; significant political costs or scandals causing a freeze; evidence that many May actions exhausted the ready-to-issue pipeline.\n- Note on resolution detail: Grants are counted by the date they are made; they must be publicly disclosed to count, but the key is whether >2 grants occur in June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump grant executive clemency to more than 2 individuals in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nGuardian: [Trump white-collar criminal pardons cost public $1bn, says ex-DoJ official](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/02/trump-pardons-cost-liz-oyer)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Donald J. Trump grants [executive clemency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_granted_executive_clemency_in_the_second_presidency_of_Donald_Trump) to greater than 2 individuals in June 2025.\n\nPartial pardons or clemencies count. They will only count if publicly disclosed. Wide-reaching blanket pardons or commutations also count.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn late May 2025, President Trump granted clemency to a large group of individuals.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
