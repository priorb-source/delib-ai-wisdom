  "information": "The Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) has been the leading party in every Viennese state election since 1945.\n\nPublic polls from outlets such as ElectsWorld and ORF ahead of the April 27, 2025, election consistently showed the SPÖ with 38-40% of the vote, compared to the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) with 21-24%, indicating a lead of 16-19 percentage points.\n\nThe SPÖ is the incumbent party governing Vienna and is noted to have a well-established and entrenched local party organization.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "6 days (election is on April 27, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "SPÖ wins the most seats, continuing their unbroken dominance in Vienna since 1945",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A massive polling error (>15 points), unprecedented late-breaking scandal affecting SPÖ, or dramatic differential turnout allows FPÖ or another party to overtake SPÖ despite the large polling gap",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "SPÖ maintains their substantial polling lead of 16-19 percentage points over the nearest competitor and wins a plurality of seats as all recent polls predict",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors a Yes outcome. The SPÖ has an unbroken 80-year winning streak in Vienna (every election since 1945), demonstrating extraordinary structural dominance. Current polling from multiple sources consistently shows SPÖ at 38-40% versus FPÖ at 21-24%, a commanding 16-19 point lead. With only 6 days until the election, there is minimal time for dramatic shifts. The SPÖ's entrenched local organization and incumbent status provide additional advantages. In proportional representation systems like Austria's, seat allocation closely tracks vote share, so this polling lead should translate directly to a seat plurality. Standard polling errors (typically 3-5 points) would not be sufficient to overcome this margin. For SPÖ to lose, we would need either a historically unprecedented polling error (>15 points across multiple pollsters) or a catastrophic last-minute event. While elections always carry some uncertainty and black swan events are possible, the convergence of historical precedent, consistent polling data, structural advantages, and limited time makes this one of the most predictable electoral outcomes possible. My forecast is not 100% because unforeseen events can occur and polling errors, while unlikely to be large enough, do exist. It's not lower because the empirical evidence is overwhelming and mutually reinforcing across multiple dimensions.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
