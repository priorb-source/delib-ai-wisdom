    "review": "All three forecasters converge on similar reasoning and reach forecasts in the narrow 72-78% range, which suggests strong agreement on the key evidence. Forecasters 2 and 3 both emphasize a temporal argument I had considered but didn't explicitly highlight: we're already on April 22nd, meaning approximately two-thirds of the month has passed under the same conditions that drove March's 1.5% monthly inflation rate. This strengthens the case for crossing 15.0%, as any reversal would need to have occurred in the remaining days of April. Forecaster 2 makes the excellent point that the NBU's forecast expects decline 'during the summer,' not in April specifically, reinforcing that April should still see the elevated inflation they predicted for Q2. Forecaster 3 notes that even modest continuation of recent trends would push us over the threshold. However, no forecaster presented evidence that fundamentally challenges my original analysis or introduces truly new information. The temporal argument was implicit in my status quo analysis but deserved more explicit emphasis. The tight clustering of forecasts (72-78%) suggests we're all appropriately accounting for both the strong upward momentum and the remaining uncertainties about exact monthly dynamics and potential early disinflationary effects.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find our reasoning highly convergent. The temporal dimension - that most of April has already occurred under the pressures that drove March's acceleration - reinforces rather than challenges my original assessment. We all agree on: (1) proximity to threshold (0.4 pp), (2) clear acceleration trend, (3) NBU's Q2 peak forecast, (4) persistent structural pressures, and (5) some countervailing factors from monetary policy and potential seasonal effects. The main question is whether these arguments warrant updating from my original 78%. The temporal argument is compelling, but I had implicitly incorporated this in my status quo analysis. The consensus range of 72-78% suggests reasonable calibration across all forecasts. I don't see compelling evidence to move significantly. The slight variation (72% vs 77% vs 78%) likely reflects minor differences in weighing remaining uncertainty rather than fundamental disagreement. Given the strong convergence and lack of truly novel information, I'm maintaining my forecast at 78%, which appropriately balances the high probability of crossing 15.0% against remaining data uncertainties and possible early disinflationary effects.",
