    "review": "Forecaster 2’s logic tracks closely with mine: very short runway, no visible prep signals, and only a modest countervailing incentive (end-of-Q2 fundraising). Their 15% is consistent with a low, non-zero hazard. Forecaster 3 adds the Miami City Commission timing as a reason to wait, which reinforces a No. I don’t find their 30% compelling given the absence of leaks, staffing, or event holds that typically precede a serious statewide launch, even if an “announcement” could technically be done with minimal paperwork. Overall, no materially new evidence emerged to lift the odds materially; if anything, the local-issue timing points further toward delay.",
    "rationale": "We have 26 days left until July 1. The base case is No: there are no leaks of a date, no exploratory/committee moves tied to a governor run, no staff hiring chatter, and no event venue holds reported. Trump’s endorsement of Donalds reduces near-term oxygen and argues for waiting to assess the field (including Casey DeSantis). The pending city election timing/term-extension issue provides another reason not to rush. Countervailing considerations keep the probability above near-zero: the historical 12–18 month pre-primary window makes late June plausible, Suarez has shown a willingness to launch quickly (e.g., 2023), and a low-friction “announcement” (social/video) could be timed to catch Q2 fundraising. Still, absent any concrete pre-launch signals by early June, the near-term hazard remains low. I see no new arguments in deliberation that justify moving meaningfully upward; if anything, the city-commission dynamic slightly strengthens the No case. I’m holding my forecast.",
