    "review": "My initial forecast was 85%, while both other forecasters arrived at 95%. Their reasoning for the higher probability is convincing. I had not considered the points they raised, which materially weaken the case for a 'No' outcome. Specifically, Forecaster 2's mention of the slow, state-level waiver process as the established mechanism for this type of change reinforces the strength of bureaucratic inertia. Forecaster 3 made a compelling argument that a new administration would likely prefer a structured policy rollout (i.e., announcing the start of a formal rulemaking process) rather than making a hasty, confusing, and legally questionable cosmetic change to a website. These arguments directly address the primary scenario I envisioned for a 'No' resolution, making that scenario less likely than I had initially judged.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 85% to 95%, aligning with the other forecasters. They convinced me that I had overestimated the probability of a quick, informal change to the website text. The arguments that the established path for such a change is slow and incremental (via state waivers), and that a new administration would likely prefer an orderly policy announcement over a confusing ad-hoc website edit, are very strong. The institutional hurdles and procedural norms of federal rulemaking are the dominant factors in this short timeframe. A 5% chance for a 'No' outcome sufficiently accounts for the small but non-zero possibility that the new administration opts for a rapid, symbolic action despite the procedural and political risks. The overwhelming likelihood is that the process for such a change, even if initiated, will not be completed and reflected on the USDA's website by July 1, 2025.",
