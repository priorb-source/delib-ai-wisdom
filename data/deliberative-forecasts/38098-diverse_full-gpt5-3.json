    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the same core points I used: extremely short timeline, explicit denials from Norman’s office, visible focus on a 2026 governor run, no preparatory campaign signals, and Graham’s consolidated support (notably Trump’s endorsement). They also emphasize that a credible Senate launch would typically show early staff/donor/FEC signals and that the lack thereof, this close to the date, makes a surprise declaration unlikely. I don’t see new facts, but I agree with their stress on day-by-day decay in odds as June passes without movement.",
    "rationale": "Given 32 days left and no observable groundwork, a declaration before July 1 would likely require an abrupt and unusual pivot—something typically preceded by leaks or exploratory steps that are absent. The political incentives also cut against it: challenging a Trump-endorsed incumbent is high-cost, while Norman’s reported interest lies with the governorship. While a shock event could flip the calculus, there’s no sign of one. I slightly trim my estimate to reflect time decay and the unanimity of signals pointing away from a Senate run.",
