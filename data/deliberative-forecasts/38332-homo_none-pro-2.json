    "review": "The other two forecasters presented reasoning that was broadly aligned with my own, but they placed a stronger emphasis on the fundamental political and diplomatic drivers, which I found convincing. Both Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 compellingly articulated that the ideological alignment between President Orsi and President Lula, combined with the high diplomatic cost of refusing a personal invitation from a key regional power like Brazil, makes a 'Yes' outcome the strong default. Forecaster 2 made a particularly important point that I had underweighted: that the current timeframe, with 25 days remaining, is not unusually short for this type of diplomatic announcement. This weakens my primary rationale for a lower probability, which was based on the delay since March signaling significant hesitation.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am updating my forecast upwards. My initial forecast of 60% was driven by a significant concern that the lack of an announcement by early June was strong evidence of internal debate or a decision to send a lower-level delegate. The other forecasters have persuaded me that I was likely overweighting the signal of this delay. The core arguments for a 'Yes' outcome remain very strong and are likely dispositive. The personal invitation from President Lula, the ideological simpatico between the two administrations, and the sheer diplomatic gravity of the Brazil-Uruguay relationship make a refusal highly improbable and diplomatically costly. As the other forecasters pointed out, accepting is a relatively low-cost action that reinforces a crucial regional alliance and signals a pragmatic, multi-aligned foreign policy. While the possibility of a 'No' resolution remains, primarily through the sending of a non-presidential representative, the arguments from my peers have convinced me that the fundamental logic points more strongly toward the president announcing his attendance. I am increasing my forecast to reflect a higher confidence in this outcome, moving closer to the consensus view.",
