    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 38 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the status quo is that Israel does NOT have a 17% tariff on the US harmonized tariff schedule. The US and Israel have maintained a free trade agreement since 1985, with most Israeli goods entering the US duty-free or at very low rates.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The proposed 17% tariff is not implemented by June 1, 2025. This could occur through successful negotiations between the US and Israel, political pushback from pro-Israel constituencies in Congress, legal challenges, delays in implementation, or the administration deciding to exempt Israel from broader tariff measures due to the strategic alliance.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration implements a 17% reciprocal or universal tariff on Israeli imports as part of broader trade policy measures, and this tariff is reflected in the harmonized tariff schedule by June 1, 2025. This would require the administration to prioritize trade policy over traditional diplomatic considerations with this key ally.",
    "rationale": "The Times of Israel article indicates that Israeli industrial organizations are seriously concerned about potential US tariffs causing significant economic damage ($2.3B annually), suggesting this is an active policy proposal rather than mere speculation. The specific 17% figure in the question aligns with Trump's reciprocal tariff framework being discussed in early 2025. However, several factors weigh against implementation by June 1: (1) The US-Israel relationship enjoys exceptional bipartisan support in Congress, unlike most other countries; (2) Israel is considered a critical strategic ally, particularly in the Middle East; (3) Pro-Israel lobbying groups wield substantial influence in Washington; (4) The 38-day timeframe is relatively short for finalizing such a significant policy change affecting a key ally; (5) Even if announced, implementation often faces delays, modifications, or exemptions. Trump has demonstrated willingness to impose tariffs broadly, but Israel has historically been treated differently than other trading partners. The status quo strongly favors maintaining preferential treatment. For my forecast to increase, I would need evidence of: formal tariff announcements specifically targeting Israel, lack of political opposition mobilizing, or confirmation that Israel is included in broader tariff schedules without exemption. For my forecast to decrease, I would need signs of successful negotiations, explicit exemptions being granted, or delays in implementation timelines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tarifff schedule list the tariff on Israel as 17% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTimes of Israel: [Israeli exports to US will take annual $2.3B hit under tariffs, industrial org warns](https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-exports-to-us-will-take-2-3-billion-hit-under-tariffs-industrialist-org-warns/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 17% for Israel at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=israel) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
