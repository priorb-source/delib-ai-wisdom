  "information": "A historical analysis of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database from 2015 to 2024 identified between four and six pilot reports originating from Africa over the ten-year period. The specific countries mentioned for these past reports include South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda. Globally, pilot reports typically account for approximately 1% of the 5,000 to 6,000 total UFO sightings logged by NUFORC annually.\n\nOn January 1, 2025, a pilot report was logged in the NUFORC database describing a sighting of a four-craft inline formation of UFOs in Rwanda. Additionally, a separate, non-pilot sighting of a glowing sphere was reported over Cape Town, South Africa, on January 22, 2025.\n\nAccording to U.S. government data, 757 Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) incidents were reported between May 2023 and June 2024, with 708 of these occurring in the air. One notable incident from January 2023 involved a U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jet colliding with an unidentified object over Arizona, resulting in damage to the aircraft's canopy.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days - 9 days until June 2025 begins, then 30 days of June, then resolution shortly after July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No pilot report from Africa in June 2025, consistent with historical rarity of such reports",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No pilots flying over African countries in June 2025 witness or report any UFO/UAP sightings to NUFORC, which aligns with the historical pattern where such reports average less than one per year from the entire African continent",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial, military, or private pilot encounters a UFO/UAP while flying over any African country during June 2025 and submits a report to NUFORC, which then publishes it in their database accessible at the specified link",
    "rationale": "The historical base rate is extremely low: 4-6 pilot reports from Africa over 10 years (2015-2024) equals approximately 0.5 reports per year, or 0.042 reports per month if uniformly distributed. This suggests roughly a 4% baseline probability for any given month. Several factors inform my forecast: AGAINST higher probability: The rarity is stark - pilot reports constitute only ~1% of total UFO reports globally, and Africa generates few reports overall due to lower air traffic density and potentially less developed reporting infrastructure compared to North America or Europe. The historical pattern strongly favors continuation of this rarity, and good forecasting demands heavy weight on status quo. SUPPORTING modest probability: The January 1, 2025 Rwanda pilot report shows at least some activity this year, though this could be random variation rather than a trend. The question allows any of 54 African countries and 30 days in June for an event to occur. NUFORC continues to actively collect reports. Why not lower (e.g., 1-2%): The base rate calculation suggests 4%+ per month, and completely dismissing this would be overconfident. The recent Rwanda report demonstrates such events do occasionally occur. Why not higher (e.g., 10-15%): Historical data strongly indicates these reports are rare. Having one report in January doesn't establish a trend - it could easily be the only African pilot report for all of 2025. The status quo of slow change and pattern persistence should dominate. My forecast respects the empirical base rate while acknowledging inherent uncertainty in rare events",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA historical analysis of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database from 2015 to 2024 identified between four and six pilot reports originating from Africa over the ten-year period.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
