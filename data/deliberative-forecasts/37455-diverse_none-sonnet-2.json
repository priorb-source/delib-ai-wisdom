    "review": "Forecaster 2 presents an optimistic case at 85%, emphasizing that licensing clears the 'single largest hurdle' and that Starlink can move quickly with existing infrastructure. However, this seems to underweight the significance of the 3-week lag since licensing without any visible progress. Forecaster 3's 40% aligns closely with my original reasoning and raises a crucial point I hadn't fully considered: Lesotho being landlocked within South Africa, where Starlink has faced regulatory constraints. This creates potential complications around geofencing, fulfillment logistics, and political sensitivities that could slow activation. Both Forecaster 3 and I emphasize status quo bias and the lack of any launch signals (announcements, equipment shipments, order page updates), which should lower confidence in near-term activation. Forecaster 2's high confidence would be more justified if we had evidence of active preparations, but the complete absence of such signals after 3 weeks suggests remaining operational steps are non-trivial. The South Africa complication is particularly compelling - careful geofencing would be needed to ensure service respects existing regulatory boundaries, and political optics around serving an enclave within a country where Starlink has faced pushback adds friction. While Starlink's technical capabilities are impressive, the combination of: (1) zero movement in 3 weeks, (2) no public announcements or timeline, (3) South Africa complications, and (4) typical multi-week to multi-month lags from license to availability, all support a more cautious forecast.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasters' analyses, I find Forecaster 3's reasoning most persuasive and aligned with sound forecasting principles. The key insight about Lesotho's unique position - landlocked within South Africa where Starlink faces regulatory issues - adds an important friction factor I initially underweighted. This isn't just about technical deployment; it involves careful geofencing to respect South African boundaries and navigating potentially sensitive political dynamics. The 3-week post-license lag without any signs of progress (no announcements, no order page updates, no shipping information) is a strong negative signal. If a June launch were planned, we would typically see preparatory activity by now. Forecaster 2's 85% probability assumes Starlink will prioritize and execute flawlessly within the remaining 54 days, but this doesn't account for the revealed information from the 3-week delay or the specific regional complications. My original 40% forecast appropriately balances: (1) the positive signal from licensing, (2) Starlink's demonstrated operational capabilities, (3) the strong status quo bias with limited time, (4) absence of launch indicators, and (5) the South Africa geofencing/political complications. I considered moving slightly lower to 35% given the South Africa factor, but maintain 40% to give adequate weight to the possibility that Starlink moves quickly in late May or June once operational preparations complete.",
