  "information": "The government of Benin closed its land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state around May 6-8, 2025. The specific crossing mentioned is between Taberu village in Baruten Local Government Area, Kwara State, and the neighboring Tanu village in Benin. On May 9, 2025, Benin extended its border security operations to the Sèmè and Owode borders in Lagos State. Stated reasons for the closure include concerns over arms smuggling, the emergence of a new militant group known as 'Mahmuda', and unregulated exportation of agricultural products like soya beans and cashews. Reports mentioned intelligence regarding the illegal importation of arms and ammunition from Parakou, Benin, into Nigeria.\n\nOn May 14, 2025, the Nigerian House of Representatives passed a resolution urging the Federal Government to engage in dialogue with the Republic of Benin to resolve the blockade. The motion highlighted the strain on bilateral relations and the disruption to seasonal trade critical to the livelihood of border communities. As of late May 2025, neither the Nigerian nor the Beninese government had issued any public statements suggesting an imminent reopening. On May 30, an AFRICOM briefing noted a deteriorating security threat environment along the Benin-Nigeria frontier.\n\nHistorical data on similar situations in West Africa show that border closures motivated by security concerns often persist for many months. For example, Nigeria's border closure with Benin in 2019-2020 lasted for about 16 months. Similarly, Benin's border with Niger, closed after the 2023 coup, remained shut many months later. A review of 15 security-related border closures in the ECOWAS region since 2015 indicates that approximately 20% were reopened within 60 days. Reopenings within two months are more common when the reasons are purely commercial or administrative, rather than related to terrorism or arms smuggling.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "31 days (from May 31, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The border remains closed past July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The security concerns regarding arms smuggling and the Mahmuda militant group persist. Diplomatic negotiations between Nigeria and Benin progress slowly or stall. Without concrete security agreements or confidence-building measures, Benin maintains the closure to protect its borders, and the 31-day timeframe proves insufficient for resolution.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Nigeria and Benin engage in intensive high-level diplomatic negotiations that produce rapid security cooperation agreements. Nigeria implements stronger border control measures, potentially involving joint military operations against the Mahmuda group. With immediate security improvements and political will on both sides, the border reopens before July 1, demonstrating the kind of quick resolution seen in about 20% of similar cases.",
    "rationale": "This forecast must heavily weight the status quo given the short timeframe and serious nature of the closure. The border was closed only 23-25 days ago for significant security reasons: arms smuggling and a new terror group. Historical data from my research assistant shows only 20% of security-related ECOWAS border closures reopened within 60 days, and we have less than half that time (31 days). The Nigeria-Benin border closure of 2019-2020 lasted 16 months. Most concerning, AFRICOM's May 30 assessment noted a deteriorating security environment—moving in the wrong direction. While Nigeria's House of Representatives passed a resolution on May 14 urging dialogue, there have been no public statements from either government suggesting imminent reopening. In fact, Benin escalated by extending operations to Lagos borders on May 9. The 31-day window is extremely compressed for resolving complex security issues involving terrorism and arms trafficking. These typically require extended negotiation, trust-building, and implementation of security measures. My forecast is not higher because there are no concrete signs of progress or high-level diplomatic engagement. It's not lower because some rapid resolutions do occur (the 20% base rate), economic pressure exists, and bilateral relations matter to both countries. I would update higher if high-level meetings were announced or security cooperation agreements emerged. I would update lower if more incidents occurred or diplomatic efforts visibly stalled.",
