    "review": "The other two forecasters are in complete agreement with my initial analysis, both in terms of the final probability (99%) and the underlying rationale. We all correctly identify that this question is resolved by looking at historical data, as the March 2025 period has passed. The core argument shared by all is that Ukraine's government debt has been multiples of the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold for several years, and the ongoing economic pressures from the war make a decrease below this level a practical impossibility. Forecaster 3 provides useful context by naming the specific international bodies providing loans, which explains the mechanism of the debt increase. Forecaster 2 reinforces the long-term trend, noting the debt has been above the threshold for over a decade. Neither raised any arguments or evidence I had not considered. Their reasoning is highly convincing and aligns perfectly with my own, including the justification for the 1% hedge against a 100% forecast (i.e., data errors or source issues, not plausible economic scenarios).",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses of the other forecasters, my confidence in my initial forecast of 99% is reinforced. There is a strong consensus, and no new information has been presented to challenge the core thesis. The data from the resolution source, Trading Economics, is dispositive. The most recent available data for February 2025 showed debt at approximately 6.65 trillion UAH, a figure more than 3.5 times the 1.90 trillion UAH threshold. The analyses from the other forecasters add supplementary context but do not alter the fundamental conclusion. The war economy necessitates massive ongoing borrowing, making any significant decrease in total government debt, let alone a 70%+ reduction in a single month, inconceivable. Therefore, the March 2025 figure is virtually certain to be well above the threshold. I am maintaining my forecast at 99%, with the 1% chance of a 'No' outcome reserved for non-economic possibilities such as a major retroactive data revision by the source, a fundamental redefinition of the debt metric, or a technical failure in the resolution process itself. The deliberation has confirmed that this is the appropriate level of confidence.",
