    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Just over one month. The deadline is June 1, 2025. Today is April 29, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, Alassane Ouattara has not declared his candidacy for the 2025 presidential election. If the deadline passes with no change, the outcome will be No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The deadline of June 1, 2025, passes without any formal declaration of candidacy from Alassane Ouattara. He may choose to maintain strategic ambiguity about his intentions, waiting until later in the summer or autumn to announce his decision, or ultimately decide not to run at all.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before June 1, 2025, Alassane Ouattara makes a formal public announcement stating his intention to be a candidate in the 2025 presidential election. This declaration would likely occur at a major rally for his party, the RHDP, or through an official statement reported by credible national and international media.",
    "rationale": "My forecast leans towards No because the strategic advantages of delaying an announcement likely outweigh the benefits of declaring in the next month. The status quo is that Ouattara has not declared. At 83, and after his controversial third term, maintaining ambiguity is a powerful political tool. It keeps his own camp united, prevents would-be successors from emerging too early, and forces the opposition to plan for multiple scenarios. While his party, the RHDP, largely supports him running again and may be pressuring him to declare to consolidate support, there is no specific political event or deadline before June 1 that necessitates such an early announcement. Presidential declarations in Côte d'Ivoire are often made closer to the election, which is scheduled for October 2025. A declaration in July or August would be more typical.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 35% because there is a significant chance he could declare. In 2020, he reversed a previous decision not to run, demonstrating his willingness to remain in power. An early declaration now would be a show of force, aimed at demoralizing a fragmented opposition and solidifying his position as the inevitable candidate. This could be seen as a necessary move to set the political agenda early.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 35% because the aformentioned benefits of strategic delay appear to be the more likely course of action for a seasoned political operator like Ouattara. Waiting allows him to better assess the strengths and strategies of his main rivals, such as Tidjane Thiam of the PDCI and potentially Laurent Gbagbo.\n\nI would increase my probability if credible reports emerged of a major RHDP party congress being scheduled for May, as this would be a likely venue for an announcement. I would decrease my probability if Ouattara or his surrogates make public statements emphasizing his need for 'more time to reflect', signaling an announcement is not imminent.",
