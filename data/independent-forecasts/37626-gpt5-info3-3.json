  "information": "Recent trade policy developments include the introduction of a new 10% U.S. tariff on bananas, effective April 5, 2025. Separately, following trade talks in Geneva, a trade agreement between the U.S. and China was announced on May 14, 2025. The agreement includes tariff reductions and is expected by some analysts to reduce global economic uncertainty.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 4 weeks (BLS will publish May 2025 average price data in mid-June 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the reported price is at or above $0.6300 per lb.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Retailers pass through higher landed costs from the new 10% U.S. import tariff (effective Apr 5) and elevated logistics/port fees, keeping the national average around $0.64–$0.70 in May. Typical month‑to‑month moves are small, so remaining ≥$0.6300 is the most likely outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A combination of aggressive national promotions (bananas used as a loss leader at 49–59¢/lb), short‑term oversupply from Latin America, and easing freight costs pushes the BLS average down to $0.629 or lower despite the tariff.",
    "rationale": "Threshold check: A Yes requires the BLS series APU0000711211 for May 2025 to be ≤$0.629. In recent years this series has mostly run in the low-to-mid 60¢ range; in 2024 it commonly printed near $0.63–$0.67. That makes $0.6300 the low end of the recent range. With a new 10% U.S. tariff on bananas effective Apr 5, 2025, the near‑term bias is upward, and bananas’ perishability plus weekly retail pricing implies relatively quick pass‑through into May shelf prices. Month‑to‑month volatility for this series is typically modest (on the order of 1–3%), so getting below $0.6300 in May would likely require an atypically large drop if April was in the mid‑$0.60s. The reported U.S.–China tariff reductions announced May 14 are unlikely to affect May banana prices (bananas are primarily sourced from Latin America and the timing is late in the pricing window). Countervailing considerations that keep this from being near 0%: U.S. grocers sometimes price bananas aggressively as a traffic driver; a run of widespread promos could pull down the national average. If ocean freight or port congestion costs unexpectedly ease, or if the tariff is delayed/softened/exemptions emerge, that would also raise the chance of a sub‑$0.6300 print. Why not higher: The fresh tariff and earlier supply‑chain/port‑fee pressures make a sub‑$0.6300 outcome unlikely; a drop below the threshold would be against the present cost trend. Why not lower: Nonzero risk remains from aggressive retail discounting and potential temporary supply gluts. What would move me: Up (higher Yes probability) if April’s BLS banana price (released with the May 14 CPI) is ≤$0.63, if credible reports show tariff suspension/exemptions, or if USDA/retail data show widespread sub‑60¢ promos in May. Down (lower Yes probability) if April prints ≥$0.66, if import/wholesale quotes rise further, or if retailers signal pass‑through of the tariff has intensified.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the price of bananas reported by the US BLS for May 2025 be under 63 cents a pound?\n\nQuestion background:\nQuartz: [Move over, eggs – bananas are the next victim](https://qz.com/bananas-dole-price-hikes-inflation-port-fees-trump-tari-1851772583)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the price reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics [here](https://data.bls.gov/toppicks?survey=ap) for Bananas, per lb. - APU0000711211, to the thousandths of a decimal point, is under $0.6300 for May 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nRecent trade policy developments include the introduction of a new 10% U.S. tariff on bananas, effective April 5, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
