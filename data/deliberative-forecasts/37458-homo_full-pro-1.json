    "review": "The analyses from my fellow forecasters are both well-reasoned and align closely with my own initial assessment. We have all identified the same core tension: a strong status quo of non-communication and mutual distrust pointing towards 'No', versus the significant potential for a breakthrough at the upcoming May 10-11 Geneva talks, which is the most plausible path to 'Yes'. I find Forecaster 2's emphasis on China's established 'pattern of denial' particularly compelling. This point strengthens the 'No' case not just because calls aren't happening, but because the high bar of 'mutual acknowledgment' in the resolution criteria becomes even more difficult to clear in the current diplomatic environment. The core difference between the three forecasts is simply a matter of weighting the probability of a positive outcome from the Geneva talks, with all of us placing it as a meaningful but unlikely event.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am lowering my forecast. My initial assessment was largely validated, but Forecaster 2's argument regarding China's repeated and public denials of President Trump's claims has convinced me that the barrier to a 'Yes' resolution is slightly higher than I first calculated. The question requires not just a phone call, but a *mutually acknowledged* one. The existing pattern of claim-and-denial suggests that even if a call were to occur, there's a non-trivial chance that China would not publicly confirm it, causing the question to resolve as 'No'. This adds an additional hurdle on top of the already significant diplomatic friction. While I still believe the high-level talks in Geneva on May 10-11 are a critical catalyst that could change the situation, the added difficulty of meeting the specific resolution criteria in this climate of distrust leads me to decrease my probability estimate. I am therefore moving my forecast down from 30% to 25%, aligning with Forecaster 2.",
