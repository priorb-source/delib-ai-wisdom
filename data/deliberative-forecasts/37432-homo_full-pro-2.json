    "review": "Both other forecasters arrived at similar conclusions to my own, but with slightly lower probabilities. We all correctly identified the central conflict: the Republican supermajority's theoretical power versus the strong, recent evidence of their lack of will to pass this specific legislation, as demonstrated by the removal of a proof-of-citizenship provision from the transportation budget in February 2025. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly compelling in framing Governor DeWine's hesitation not just as a post-enactment problem (a potential veto), but as a pre-enactment deterrent that increases the political cost for the legislature and makes them less likely to pass the bill in the first place. This point about intra-party friction acting as a significant legislative hurdle is something I may have initially undervalued.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am lowering my probability from 30% to 25%. The reasoning of the other forecasters has persuaded me that I was slightly overweighting the raw power of the Republican supermajority and slightly underweighting the significance of recent, specific actions that signal disunity and a lack of political will on this issue. The proactive removal of the proof-of-citizenship provision from the transportation budget by Republicans themselves is the most powerful piece of evidence, and the other forecasters rightly centered it in their analyses. Furthermore, Forecaster 3's point about the chilling effect of Governor DeWine's opposition on the legislative process itself, making leaders hesitant to burn political capital on an intra-party fight, is a crucial dynamic. A 25% forecast still acknowledges that with a supermajority and a tight timeline, a sudden shift in priorities could lead to rapid passage. However, it more accurately reflects the significant, demonstrated inertia and internal divisions that make the status quo—no new law being enacted—the most likely outcome.",
