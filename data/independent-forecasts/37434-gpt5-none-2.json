    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 57 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No bankruptcy filing before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "AquaBounty continues operating while cutting costs and stretching payables, and/or secures a small bridge financing, asset sale proceeds, or other lifeline that extends runway past July 1, avoiding a filing in the next two months even if long-term uncertainty remains.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Liquidity tightens faster than expected (e.g., cash burn, vendor pressure, covenant or lease defaults), attempts to raise capital or sell assets fail, and the company files a Chapter 11 (or other US bankruptcy) petition before July 1 to protect from creditors and restructure.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon and status quo: Only ~8 weeks remain. Even distressed microcaps often manage to avoid an immediate filing via short-term measures (equity taps, bridge notes, payment deferrals). Weighting the status quo outcome leads to a tilt toward No within this short window.\n- Public signals: The March 27, 2025 full-year 2024 results press release (linked) underscores continuing challenges (ongoing losses, prior project pause in Ohio, need for financing/strategic options). Such language raises medium-term bankruptcy risk, but does not by itself imply an imminent filing within weeks. My research assistant had no additional information indicating an already-announced default, missed payroll, termination of forbearance, or other classic immediate filing triggers.\n- Why not higher: (1) Short time left; (2) Companies in this situation frequently find incremental capital or stretch payables to get past near-term dates; (3) Bankruptcy filings tend to follow acute catalysts (lender acceleration, cash crisis) that would usually be hinted at in recent 8-Ks/press—none was flagged here.\n- Why not lower: (1) The firm appears financially stressed with a history of losses and stalled expansion, keeping baseline bankruptcy risk elevated; (2) Capital markets for very small, loss-making issuers can be difficult, so a sudden liquidity shortfall is plausible; (3) If vendors or landlords tighten terms, a fast pivot to Chapter 11 can occur.\n- What would move me upward: Public disclosure of a default/acceleration, failed financing that was previously expected to close, auditor going-concern emphasis plus stated runway < 1–2 months, vendor or landlord enforcement actions, or an 8-K indicating exploration of “strategic alternatives” has concluded without a financing/asset sale.\n- What would move me downward: Evidence of new financing or asset-sale proceeds, extended runway guidance into/through Q3 2025, or credible cost reductions that materially lower burn.\nOverall, absent a clear acute trigger and given the short window, a modest but nontrivial probability is appropriate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill AquaBounty Technologies file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[AquaBounty Technologies Announces Full Year 2024 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603978/000160397825000012/aqb-20250327xex99_1.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
