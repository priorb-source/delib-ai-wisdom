    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. The outcome will be determined after May 31, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The company has not posted on its News page in three months. If this trend continues, there will be no post in May.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Virgin Galactic announces a significant event, such as a major development milestone for its Delta-class ships, a new partnership, or a change in corporate strategy, and promotes it with a post on its News page in May.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The company continues its current period of infrequent public communication. Any routine announcements, such as the Q1 2025 earnings report, are confined to the investor relations section of its website, consistent with recent practice. No other major newsworthy events occur.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on Virgin Galactic's recent posting frequency and the type of content posted to its 'News' page. The company's most recent post was on January 30, 2025. This implies that their Q4 2024 earnings announcement, which occurred in late February 2025, was not published on this page. This is a critical piece of evidence, as it suggests that the most predictable corporate announcement—the Q1 2025 earnings report expected in May—is unlikely to appear on the News page either. The status quo is a three-month silence, which is a significant increase from the prior 1.5-month gap between posts, indicating a decreasing communication frequency on this platform. With the company in a transitional phase focusing on the development of its Delta-class fleet, there are fewer operational events to report. Therefore, the probability of another month passing without a post is high. My forecast is not higher than 80% to account for the possibility of an unexpected, non-routine announcement, such as a major technical breakthrough or strategic development, which the company would want to publicize. My forecast is not lower because the evidence strongly suggests that the most reliable trigger for a corporate post (quarterly earnings) does not apply to this specific webpage, making the continuation of the status quo the most likely outcome. I would lower my probability if credible reports emerged of an imminent announcement.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Virgin Galactic fail to make any new posts on its News page in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAs of April 19, 2025, Virgin Galactic's most recent post was timestamped January 30, 2025. The most recent one before then was December 12, 2024.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if no new posts appear at Virgin Galactic's News page, which can be accessed at [this address](https://www.virgingalactic.com/news), timestamped after April 30, 2025 and before June 1, 2025. If there is a new post, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
