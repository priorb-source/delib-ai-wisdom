    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months (from May 2, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Ethiopia maintains its current travel advisory level, which is likely Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) or lower, not reaching Level 4 before the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ethiopia's security situation remains relatively stable over the next two months. Existing conflicts and ethnic tensions continue but do not dramatically escalate. The US State Department maintains Ethiopia's current advisory level, finding no compelling reason to escalate to the most severe Level 4 designation before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major security crisis erupts in Ethiopia, such as a significant escalation of civil conflict, widespread ethnic violence affecting major population centers including Addis Ababa, a large-scale terrorist attack, or complete breakdown of government control. This prompts the US State Department to urgently upgrade Ethiopia to Level 4 'Do Not Travel' advisory to protect American citizens.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No outcome. Level 4 travel advisories are the most severe designation and are reserved for extreme situations like active war zones or complete government collapse. They are relatively rare and the State Department does not issue them lightly. With only 2 months until resolution, there is limited time for conditions to deteriorate sufficiently to warrant such an upgrade. While the question background mentions 'new travel warnings in 2025,' suggesting heightened concern, this does not necessarily indicate an imminent Level 4 designation. Ethiopia has faced ongoing security challenges including ethnic tensions and regional conflicts, but has maintained a functioning government and some level of tourism infrastructure. The short timeframe is critical - advisory level changes, especially to Level 4, typically follow significant deterioration over time rather than sudden shifts. My research assistant provided no additional information suggesting imminent major security deterioration. My forecast is not higher because: there is no evidence of immediate crisis-level deterioration, the timeframe is very short, and Level 4 designations are exceptional events. My forecast is not lower because: Ethiopia does have real security concerns, the article reference suggests recent elevated warnings, and unexpected rapid deterioration, while unlikely, is possible. I would update higher if: evidence emerged of major new conflicts, attacks on foreigners, or government collapse. I would update lower if: I confirmed Ethiopia's current level is Level 2 or if recent security improvements were documented.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ethiopia receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nTravel and Tour World: [Is Ethiopia Safe for Travel?

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Ethiopia has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Ethiopia.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025,\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
