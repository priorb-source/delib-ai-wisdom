    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A court order related to the CFTC lawsuit forces Kalshi to halt offering sports markets, or a simple operational error leads to them failing to list a market on at least one day in June 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kalshi's legal situation remains stable or improves, allowing them to continue their business-as-usual operations, and they successfully list at least one MLB market every day for the entire month of June 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the strong tendency towards the status quo in the short term, balanced against significant, specific legal risk. The status quo is that Kalshi currently offers daily baseball markets and has a clear business incentive to continue doing so. Legal and regulatory changes, even when a judge intends to 'move quickly', rarely have an immediate operational impact within a 30-day window. Therefore, the most probable outcome is that business continues as usual through June 2025. However, my forecast is not higher than 70% due to two key risks. The primary risk is the ongoing lawsuit with the CFTC. An adverse ruling, such as a preliminary injunction, could be issued within the month and force Kalshi to delist sports markets, which the CFTC could argue are too similar to 'gaming'. The provided news that a judge will 'move quickly' elevates this from a background risk to a more immediate uncertainty. The second risk is operational; the resolution criteria are strict, requiring a market to be offered *every single day*. A single technical glitch or human error over the 30-day period would cause this question to resolve as 'No'. My forecast is not lower because Kalshi is actively fighting the lawsuit and is unlikely to voluntarily halt a major market category, as it would weaken both its business and its legal position. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see a favorable preliminary ruling for Kalshi or a clarification that any expedited legal review is narrowly focused on non-sports markets. Conversely, I would significantly decrease my forecast if the CFTC specifically mentions sports markets in a legal filing or if credible rumors of an imminent, unfavorable settlement emerge.",
