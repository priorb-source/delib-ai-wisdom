    "review": "Forecaster 3 raises the most critical new information: Governor Abbott has not prioritized a THC ban in his stated agenda. This is decisive because only the Governor can call a special session and set its agenda, effectively closing off that pathway without his buy-in. The public opinion data (62% support legalization, 79% support medical marijuana) also creates significant political headwinds I underweighted. Forecaster 2's 45% forecast appears far too optimistic given the concrete House opposition already demonstrated - the 118-16 vote for expansion and the House committee's immediate substitution of SB 3 with a non-ban regulatory framework show entrenched resistance, not just uncertainty. While Forecaster 2 correctly notes Lt. Gov. Patrick's support and potential Senate passage, this doesn't overcome the structural barriers: a House that has already rejected the ban approach, a Governor who hasn't prioritized it, massive industry opposition, and only ~20 days remaining in session. Forecaster 3's timeline assessment (12 days vs my 48 days) may vary based on effective legislative working days, but either way reflects severe time constraints that make complex controversial legislation extremely difficult to pass.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, the most significant new information is Governor Abbott's lack of prioritization. This substantially reduces the probability of a special session, which was already a long-shot pathway. Without gubernatorial support, even strong Senate backing cannot overcome demonstrated House opposition. The House has taken two concrete actions showing rejection of a full ban: (1) passing HB 46 118-16 to expand medical access, and (2) substituting SB 3 with a regulatory framework specifically designed to NOT ban THC. This isn't speculative resistance - it's documented opposition through actual legislative actions. The public opinion data (62% support legalization) reinforces the political difficulty of passing a ban. The $8 billion hemp industry provides both economic and lobbying resources against prohibition. With approximately 20 days left and no movement toward reconciling the Senate-House divide, the probability of passage is very low. I'm updating downward from 8% to 6% based primarily on Abbott's non-prioritization eliminating the special session pathway and reinforcing that this lacks the high-level political support needed to overcome the substantial barriers.",
