  "information": "A state of emergency was declared in Samoa on March 31, 2025, due to a severe energy crisis. The declaration was scheduled to be in effect for 30 days, from April 1, 2025, through April 29, 2025.\n\nAccording to reports from Samoa NewsHub and the Samoa Observer, temporary generators were expected to be operational by the end of April, coinciding with the scheduled end of the state of emergency. However, the permanent solution to the power crisis is not anticipated to be in place until August 2025.\n\nAs of April 21, 2025, the Samoan government had not announced any plans to extend the state of emergency. The National Emergency Operation Centre's update on April 15 confirmed that emergency orders were valid until April 29. The crisis has had a significant economic impact, estimated at a 16% hit to the country's GDP.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "9 days",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The current emergency proclamation expires at 23:59 on April 29, 2025, and the government does not issue any extension or new emergency order. April 30 therefore falls outside any state of emergency.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The government extends the current energy emergency (e.g., by another 7–30 days) or issues a new emergency proclamation that remains in force on April 30, 2025—whether for the energy crisis or another hazard.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: A state of emergency for the energy crisis was declared March 31, 2025, scheduled to run April 1–29. As of April 21, there were no announced plans to extend; NEOC guidance listed orders valid until April 29. Temporary generators were expected by end of April; permanent fixes are slated for August. The crisis is economically significant (est. 16% GDP hit), which creates incentives both to retain emergency powers for fast action and to signal normalization as soon as feasible.\n- Status quo favors No: The posted end date is April 29, so absent new action the country will not be under an emergency on April 30. Governments often stick to announced end-dates when they believe near-term mitigation (temporary generation) will stabilize conditions.\n- Reasons for a Yes: Slippage in commissioning temporary generators; continued widespread load shedding; a desire to retain emergency procurement/curtailment powers through the handover to temporary capacity; or an unrelated event (e.g., late-season cyclone) prompting a fresh emergency. Samoa has precedent of rolling monthly extensions in past emergencies (e.g., COVID), and administrative cost to extend is low.\n- Reasons against a Yes: Publicly stated validity through April 29 with no extension signal by April 21; political benefit to ending the emergency on time if power reliability improves; expectation that temporary generators are operational by the end of April.\n- Why not higher: No current indication of extension, and a plausible path to stabilization by month-end. Late-April cyclone risk exists but is low and would likely be telegraphed by forecasts beforehand.\n- Why not lower: Commissioning timelines often slip; authorities may prefer a buffer to ensure system stability and maintain emergency powers during the transition, making a short extension into early May plausible.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of generator delivery/installation delays; continued or worsening rolling blackouts in the last week of April; official hints or drafts of an extension; emerging severe weather or another emergency.\n- What would move me down: Evidence that temporary generators are on-site, tested, and stabilizing supply before April 29; official statements committing to let the emergency lapse on schedule; clear improvements in outage frequency/duration.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a state of emergency be in effect in Samoa on April 30, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Samoan Prime Minister declares state of emergency over power cuts](https://www.stuff.co.nz/nz-news/360634988/samoan-prime-minister-declares-state-emergency-over-power-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) Samoa is in a state of emergency that has been declared by a governmental entity with the authority to make such a declaration.\n\nFor example, the state of emergency declaration [posted](https://www.facebook.com/samoagovt/posts/hon-prime-minister-of-samoa-press-statement-proclamation-of-emergency-energy-cri/1059050259591457/) by the government of Samoa on Facebook on March 31, 2025 would count.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
