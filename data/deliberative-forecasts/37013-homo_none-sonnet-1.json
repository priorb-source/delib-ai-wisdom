    "review": "All three forecasts converged remarkably on 70-72%, using similar reasoning about status quo persistence, lack of polling data, and Cornwall's Lib Dem tendencies. The most important new point raised by Forecaster 2 is that we're only 10 days from election day (May 1, 2025). This timing detail significantly strengthens the case for status quo persistence - at this late stage, campaigns are essentially complete, voter preferences are largely fixed, and postal votes may already be cast. This proximity makes dramatic shifts much less likely than I initially weighted. Forecaster 2's mention of Conservative national difficulties potentially helping Lib Dems locally is also relevant. Forecaster 3's point about Lib Dem Westminster representation in Cornwall reinforces their organizational strength. However, I note we may be experiencing some convergence bias - all three of us using similar base rates without hard data. The core uncertainties remain: no polling, significant Independent presence, and the 37-seat position being a plurality rather than dominance.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the 10-day timeframe is crucial information that strengthens the status quo case more than I initially weighted. Political campaigns have momentum and inertia; major shifts in the final 10 days are rare absent major scandals or events. The Lib Dems' 37-seat plurality from 2021, combined with Cornwall's historical Lib Dem strength, their local organizational capacity, and Conservative national struggles, all point toward them maintaining their position as largest party. The lack of any contrary evidence (polling showing another party ahead, reports of Lib Dem scandals, or strong Independent momentum) further supports the status quo. While the fragmented nature of Cornwall politics with Independents remains a wildcard, the proximity to election day constrains how much can change. I'm updating modestly upward to align with the other forecasters, primarily based on the short timeframe increasing status quo likelihood.",
