  "information": "According to its latest financial reports, AquaBounty Technologies' cash reserves declined from $9.2 million at the end of 2023 to $230,000 as of December 31, 2024. The company reported a GAAP EPS of -$29.47 and revenue of $0.79 million for the fiscal year, a 68% year-over-year decrease. The company's former CFO stated, \"We do not have sufficient liquidity to continue operations,\" and management has issued a going-concern warning. The company's reported debt-to-equity ratio is 0.05.\n\nIn December 2024, AquaBounty announced it was ceasing fish farming activities, shutting down its last operational facility, and culling its remaining fish stock. The company laid off \"substantially all\" of its staff at the site. With production halted, there is no operating cash inflow. Management has acknowledged that its capital-raising efforts have been unsuccessful for over a year and has stated it is \"assessing alternatives\" for its Ohio facility.\n\nBy March 2025, AquaBounty's market capitalization had fallen to approximately $2.2 million, with its stock price dropping from a 52-week high of $3.05 to well below $1. The stock is trading below the NASDAQ compliance threshold, risking delisting. Despite the low price, institutional investor Epiq Partners LLC increased its holdings in the company by 423.5% in the fourth quarter. As of early 2025, institutional investors and hedge funds own 8.92% of the company's stock.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 56 days (until end of June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No filing by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The company limps along via severe cash conservation, stretching payables, small trickle equity sales or insider/bridge funding, and/or signs an LOI for an asset sale (e.g., Ohio facility) that extends runway. It may pursue an out-of-court wind-down, dissolution, or non-bankruptcy alternatives (e.g., assignment for the benefit of creditors) and delay any U.S. bankruptcy beyond July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Cash is exhausted and creditor pressure (e.g., unpaid vendors, lease/contract claims, or litigation) forces a filing. With no operations and failed capital raises, the company files Chapter 7 liquidation or a bare-bones Chapter 11/DIP process before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon: ~8 weeks. The short window favors the status quo unless there is an acute trigger.\n- Evidence from the research assistant: Cash collapsed to ~$0.23m at 12/31/24; operations ceased with layoffs and fish cull; no operating inflow; going-concern warning; capital raises unsuccessful for over a year; market cap ~ $2.2m; stock below Nasdaq minimum; D/E ~0.05.\n- Interpreting the data:\n  - Extremely strained liquidity and no revenues significantly increase near-term insolvency risk. Ceasing operations and unsuccessful fundraising point to limited options; Chapter 7 is plausible if they cannot fund public-company overhead, legal/audit, or settlements.\n  - Offsetting that, the low debt load (D/E 0.05) implies fewer secured creditors pushing for an immediate in-court solution. Firms with little debt often pursue out-of-court wind-downs, asset sales, or simply delay filing while stretching payables. Bankruptcy itself is expensive, which can deter an immediate filing if alternatives exist.\n  - They have already made it into May without filing despite very low reported year-end cash, which suggests either severe cash triage, some small financing, or extended payables—evidence that a filing is not inevitable in the next few weeks.\n  - Potential value in the Ohio facility could support an asset sale or collateral for a short bridge; even an LOI could extend runway past July without a filing.\n- Why not higher than 40%: Low leverage reduces creditor-forced timing; evidence they’ve survived into May; companies often delay filing while exploring sales/alternatives. Non-bankruptcy wind-down is common for microcaps with minimal debt.\n- Why not lower than 40%: Cash near exhaustion, halted operations, failed raises, and going-concern language are classic precursors to a bankruptcy filing within months. With no operating cash inflow and ongoing public-company costs, a Chapter 7 before July is a realistic possibility.\n- Updaters:\n  - Raise probability: 8-Ks about defaults, missed payments, auditor resignation, retention of restructuring advisers/bankruptcy counsel, DIP discussions, or failed asset-sale process; indications that payroll/critical vendors cannot be met in June.\n  - Lower probability: Announced asset sale (especially Ohio) with near-term cash proceeds, signed financing/bridge facility, or evidence of sufficient liquidity to fund at least Q3 2025 operations/overhead; credible non-bankruptcy liquidation plan with runway beyond July.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill AquaBounty Technologies file for bankruptcy before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[AquaBounty Technologies Announces Full Year 2024 Financial Results](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1603978/000160397825000012/aqb-20250327xex99_1.htm)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if AquaBounty Technologies, Inc., files any petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States, under any chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, before July 1, 2025. The question will resolves on the filing of such a petition, not on whether any bankruptcy protection is granted by a court. If no such petition is filed by that date, this question will resolve as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to its latest financial reports, AquaBounty Technologies' cash reserves declined from $9.2 million at the end of 2023 to $230,000 as of December 31, 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
