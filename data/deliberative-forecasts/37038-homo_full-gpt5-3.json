    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize procedural inertia and the need for a presidential proclamation plus a USITC HTS revision to remove/alter 9903.01.48 before June 1, which strengthens the case for a Yes by default. They also correctly note that the suspension running past June 1 reduces urgency to change the listing early, and that the resolution counts a suspended listing as Yes. This explicit focus on the legal/administrative steps (and timing) is a useful addition to my initial reasoning. I still think there is a non-trivial chance of a rapid deal with near-immediate implementation (the HTS can update within days of a proclamation), so I find 88% slightly high. But their arguments justify moving up from my initial 76%.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining (~5.5 weeks) and the current HTS already showing +17% (suspended) make the status quo a Yes. Changing to No requires both a negotiated outcome and a formal action (presidential proclamation/USTR notice) implemented and reflected on the HTS before June 1. Given the 90-day suspension through July 9, the US has an incentive to maintain leverage and little operational need to remove the listing early. While a May deal with immediate rescission is plausible, there are no concrete signals yet of an imminent proclamation. Balancing inertia and leverage against the realistic possibility of a fast policy reversal, I raise my forecast moderately. Downside triggers: a joint announcement of a finalized agreement with an effective date before June 1 and a corresponding proclamation/HTS revision. Upside triggers: continued silence into late May or explicit indications that changes, if any, will be timed to July 9 or later.",
