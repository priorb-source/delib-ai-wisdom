    "review": "Both forecasters make largely the same core case I did: the window is very short, the government’s messaging and priorities are elsewhere, and the legal/political headwinds make a date announcement a high-cost, low-benefit move. Forecaster 3 adds a useful nuance I agree with—that any date, even far in the future and even non-binding, would resolve Yes. That slightly increases tail risk versus a “fully authorized referendum” frame. Forecaster 2 leans on the long lead times for constitutional referendums; while true operationally, it’s less binding here because a purely political date announcement (as in 2022) would suffice for resolution. Net, their arguments reinforce the low base rate; the purdah period (May 15–June 5) and strike ballot window further compress the practical announcement window to a handful of days in early May and late June. I find the overall logic compelling and marginally more bearish than my initial take.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is under two months, with an effectively narrow usable window (roughly May 2–14 and June 6–30). Since April the Scottish Government has emphasized domestic policy delivery, and there are no credible signals of imminent referendum scheduling. UK-level opposition remains firm, and SNP strategy appears oriented to 2026 rather than setting a date now. While the market’s criteria would accept even a symbolic announcement for a much later date, repeating the 2022 tactic after the Supreme Court ruling seems unlikely without clear political upside or a polling surge sustained across multiple surveys. Given peers’ emphasis on the compressed timeline and lack of signals, I’m shading down slightly. I would move up on concrete indicators: leaks of a bill or motion naming a date, coordinated messaging shifts by the First Minister/Cabinet, or multiple polls showing Yes >55% prompting a strategic pivot. I would move down further if the FM explicitly rules out any date announcement in 2025 or doubles down on a 2026-mandate strategy.\n\nChange: 5% -> 4%, reflecting the compressed announcement window and absence of lead indicators.",
