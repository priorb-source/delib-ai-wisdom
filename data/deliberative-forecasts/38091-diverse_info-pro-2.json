    "review": "I found the other analyses very helpful. Forecaster 2 provided a healthy dose of skepticism, rightly pointing out that the lack of a named candidate is a significant negative indicator and that diplomatic processes are 'lumpy' and unpredictable. This was a good check on my initial optimism. However, I found Forecaster 3's analysis most compelling. They introduced two crucial pieces of new evidence I had missed: the acting NASA Administrator's recent statement anticipating new signatories in the 'coming weeks', and the identification of two major international events in June (UN COPUOS and the Paris Air Show) that serve as ideal venues for such an announcement. This specific, timely evidence is more powerful than my general reliance on the May H2M2 summit as a catalyst.",
    "rationale": "I am revising my forecast down from 70% to 60%. My initial forecast correctly identified the strong momentum but was overly optimistic and based on a less relevant catalyst event. The arguments from the other forecasters have convinced me to lower my confidence. Forecaster 2's point about the lack of a publicly announced candidate is a significant uncertainty that I initially underweighted. However, Forecaster 3's evidence significantly strengthens the case for a 'Yes'. The NASA Administrator's comment is a direct, positive signal for near-term activity, and the COPUOS and Paris Air Show events in June provide concrete opportunities and potential deadlines for a signing ceremony to occur. This new information substantially mitigates the concern about the lack of a public plan. My updated forecast of 60% reflects a synthesis of these views: it's lower than my initial 70% due to the valid uncertainties, but it remains higher than Forecaster 3's 55% because I believe the combination of the explicit NASA statement and the two prime June venues makes a signing more likely than not.",
