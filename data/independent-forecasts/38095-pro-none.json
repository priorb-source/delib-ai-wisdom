    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About one month. The question resolves at the end of June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Presidents typically do not grant clemency every month, and large batches of clemencies are rare, especially in the first year of a new term. In any given month, the most likely outcome is zero, one, or two grants of clemency.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Donald Trump follows the pattern of his first term, focusing on policy and administration-building in his first year and refraining from issuing numerous or controversial pardons so early. He grants clemency to two or fewer individuals in June 2025, saving such actions for later in his term.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seeking to reward loyalists and energize his base early in his new term, Trump issues a small batch of pardons for politically-aligned figures, such as several individuals convicted in relation to the January 6th Capitol riot. This single act involves three or more people, causing the question to resolve Yes.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 35% is based on the tension between historical precedent and Donald Trump's unique political style. The primary factor arguing for a 'No' outcome is the established pattern of presidential pardons, including Trump's own in his first term. Presidents typically use their early months in office to pursue a policy agenda, not to spend political capital on potentially controversial clemencies. Trump did not grant his first pardon until August 2017 (his eighth month) and did not exceed the two-person threshold in a single month until well over a year into his presidency. This strong historical base rate suggests a low probability.\n\nHowever, I have adjusted the probability upwards from this base rate for several reasons. First, a second Trump term is likely to be less constrained by traditional norms. Trump has repeatedly signaled his intention to pardon individuals he sees as political allies, including those involved in the January 6th Capitol riot. There will be significant pressure from his base to act on this quickly. Second, the threshold for a 'Yes' outcome is very low ('more than 2'). A single action pardoning a small group of three or four individuals would be sufficient. This is a plausible scenario for an early, symbolic gesture to his supporters.\n\nTherefore, my forecast is not lower than 35% because Trump's rhetoric and the low threshold make a 'Yes' outcome plausible. It is not higher than 35% because the historical precedent of presidents focusing on policy early in their term is a powerful counter-argument that cannot be ignored. I would increase my forecast if Trump or his team indicated an intent to issue pardons in the first half of the year. I would decrease it if the administration's stated priorities for the first six months were exclusively focused on legislation and executive orders unrelated to the justice system.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
