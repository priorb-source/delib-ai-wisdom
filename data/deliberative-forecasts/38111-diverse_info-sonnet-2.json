    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a critical constraint I completely missed: the UK's July 4 election means it will be in caretaker mode throughout June, making UK recognition essentially impossible rather than just unlikely. This is devastating to one of my key drivers for a higher forecast. Forecaster 2's detailed analysis of EU coordination tendencies and France's conditionality is also compelling - many potential recognizers will wait for France, and France has emphasized 'useful timing/conditions' that may not be satisfied in June. However, I find Forecaster 2 may be slightly underweighting the Malta-specific reporting (preparing to declare at June 20 summit) and the explicit purpose of the June 17-20 conference to catalyze recognitions.\n\nForecaster 3's emphasis on the Franco-British initiative as a 'strong signal' is less convincing given the UK election constraint. While the initiative shows diplomatic momentum, the caretaker period makes June execution by the UK implausible. Forecaster 3's 65% seems too optimistic given these timing constraints.\n\nThe Malta report remains the strongest concrete indicator for a June recognition, but relying heavily on a single small country for a Yes resolution increases risk.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I am updating significantly downward from 60% to 48%. The UK election constraint removes what I had considered a major driver - the UK essentially cannot make such a consequential diplomatic decision during its June caretaker period. This was a critical oversight in my initial analysis.\n\nHowever, I'm not going as low as 40% because: (1) Malta is specifically reported as preparing to declare Palestine's independence at the June 20 summit - this is concrete and time-specific reporting, not just speculation; (2) The June 17-20 conference is explicitly designed to generate recognition momentum, creating a natural catalyst; (3) France, despite conditions, has made strong public statements and could still move in June even if less likely than I initially thought.\n\nThe key remaining question is whether Malta follows through and/or whether France decides conditions are satisfied. Multiple small EU countries (Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal) remain possibilities, though EU coordination tendencies work against independent action. The one-month window remains narrow, but the specific conference and Malta reporting prevent me from dropping to the 40% baseline.",
