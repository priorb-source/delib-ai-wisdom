    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Harvard University has held its 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status for many decades and the default expectation is that it will continue to do so.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite political rhetoric and threats from figures like Donald Trump, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) follows its established, lengthy, and typically apolitical procedures. No formal process to revoke Harvard's 501(c)(3) status is initiated and completed before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under intense and unprecedented political pressure, the executive branch successfully compels the IRS to fast-track a revocation of Harvard's 501(c)(3) status, possibly using a newly discovered or created pretext. The IRS issues an official revocation notice before July 1, 2025, which is then credibly reported.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant institutional inertia and procedural safeguards within the IRS. Revoking the 501(c)(3) status of a major institution like Harvard is an exceptionally rare event that requires a lengthy and complex legal and administrative process, typically taking years, not weeks. The status quo, in this case, is overwhelmingly strong. The primary driver for a potential 'Yes' outcome is the political threat mentioned in the provided background information. However, translating political rhetoric into a rapid, legally binding administrative action by the IRS is extremely difficult. The timeframe of just over two months is the most critical factor; it is highly insufficient for the required investigations, notifications, and appeals processes to conclude. My forecast is not lower than 1% because the current political environment introduces a non-zero tail risk of an unprecedented and rapid politicization of the IRS's functions. An executive administration could attempt to force the issue, creating a scenario where a legally questionable revocation is announced. My forecast is not higher because doing so would require ignoring the powerful combination of procedural law, institutional resistance to political pressure within the civil service, and the extremely short timeline. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see credible reporting that the IRS has initiated a formal, fast-tracked investigation into Harvard's status or evidence of a major, undisputed legal violation by the university that would provide a clear pretext for revocation. Conversely, my forecast would decrease if IRS or Treasury officials explicitly state that no such investigation is underway.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
