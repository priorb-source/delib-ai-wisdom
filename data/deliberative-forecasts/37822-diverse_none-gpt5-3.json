    "review": "Both forecasters appropriately weight the short time window and lack of concrete signals. Forecaster 2 adds a useful consideration about the political downside of a fourth high-profile run after three losses, which makes an early jump less likely and argues for patience. Forecaster 3 correctly notes that 40 days is enough time for a surprise move and that O’Rourke has the brand and network to move quickly; that keeps the probability from being too low. What neither explicitly highlighted is the Q2 fundraising deadline (June 30), which can incentivize pre-July announcements to show a strong first quarter—this slightly increases the near-term hazard. Overall, I find Forecaster 2’s lower number a bit too conservative given the Q2 dynamic and O’Rourke’s ability to flip a switch; Forecaster 3’s 30% feels high given the absence of tangible preparatory signals.",
    "rationale": "With ~39 days left, status quo dominates absent evidence of active ramp-up (staff hires, exploratory paperwork, venue bookings, donor calls leaking). O’Rourke’s public openness lifts the base rate above single digits, and the June 30 FEC quarter-end creates a plausible tactical reason to announce before July 1. Countervailing forces: no procedural urgency (Texas filing in late 2025), reputational risk after three losses argues for more groundwork and testing before committing, and no credible reporting of imminent action. Balancing these, I trim my prior 25% slightly to reflect the lack of concrete signals, while keeping it meaningfully above 10% due to his ability to mobilize quickly and the Q2 fundraising incentive.",
