    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the page continues to say Tesla products are not eligible for the home EV charger rebate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BC Hydro updates the page to remove the explicit statement that Tesla products are ineligible (possibly switching to generic wording) or reinstates Tesla eligibility.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The BC Hydro page still explicitly states that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program when checked on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Current policy: As of March 12, 2025, BC and BC Hydro explicitly excluded Tesla products from rebates, tied to a government directive to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S.-produced goods where practicable. This is recent and likely to persist over a one-month horizon.\n- Status quo inertia: Government rebate program rules and associated web content typically change infrequently, especially within a few months of a policy shift. With only ~1 month to go, the base case is that the page still carries the explicit Tesla exclusion.\n- Incentives and optics: Tesla is a dominant EV brand, so BC Hydro likely named it explicitly to reduce customer confusion. That increases the odds the explicit mention remains rather than being swapped out for generic language.\n- Paths to No: (1) They quietly revise the page to generic eligibility criteria that no longer name Tesla, even if de facto exclusion remains; or (2) a political/legal reversal softens the exclusion. Both seem less likely on this timeframe.\n- Why not higher: There’s a non-trivial chance communications are standardized to avoid naming specific brands, which would resolve No under the question’s criteria, even if policy hasn’t substantively changed. There’s also a small chance of a policy tweak due to backlash or trade considerations.\n- Why not lower: The exclusion is new, politically anchored, and there’s very limited time for policy U-turns. Bureaucratic and web-content inertia favor persistence through July 1.\n- What would move me upward: Confirmation that BC Hydro has reiterated the Tesla exclusion in late June communications, or evidence that the government is doubling down on Canada-preference procurement/rebates.\n- What would move me downward: Any indication the page has been revised to remove brand-specific language; public signals of a policy reconsideration, settlement, or harmonization that reinstates U.S.-brand eligibility; or reporting that Tesla products are being treated based on manufacturing origin rather than brand, leading to ambiguity in explicit mentions.\n- Research assistant input: No additional info beyond the March 12 exclusion note; no conflicting evidence identified.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill BC Hydro still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates. If you purchased or have received pre-approval for your Tesla product before March 12, 2025, it can still qualify for rebates and will be processed as normal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if BC Hydro at [this page](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebates-home-chargers.html) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, says that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program. If it does not mention Tesla being ineligible, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-30.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
