  "information": "A historical analysis of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database from 2015 to 2024 identified between four and six pilot reports originating from Africa over the ten-year period. The specific countries mentioned for these past reports include South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda. Globally, pilot reports typically account for approximately 1% of the 5,000 to 6,000 total UFO sightings logged by NUFORC annually.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 40 days. Today is May 22, 2025, so there are 9 days remaining in May, plus all 30 days of June 2025, before the outcome is determined on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The status quo strongly suggests no pilot report from Africa in June 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No pilots flying over any African country in June 2025 observe and report UFO/UAP sightings to NUFORC, or any sightings that occur go unreported to this specific database. This reflects the historical norm given the very low frequency of such reports.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A commercial, military, or private pilot flying over any of the 54 African countries during June 2025 observes an unusual aerial phenomenon and chooses to report it to NUFORC. This could occur in any country, though past reports have come from South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda.",
    "rationale": "The base rate data strongly suggests a low probability outcome. With 4-6 pilot reports from Africa over a 10-year period (2015-2024), this averages to 0.4-0.6 reports per year, or approximately 0.033-0.05 reports per month. Converting this to probability: roughly 3.3-5% per month. To contextualize further: if pilot reports globally represent 1% of 5,000-6,000 annual NUFORC sightings, that's 50-60 pilot reports worldwide per year, or about 4-5 per month globally. Africa contributing 0.5 reports per year means it represents less than 1% of global pilot reports to NUFORC. The recent example of a Rwanda report from January 2025 confirms that African pilots do occasionally report to NUFORC, providing some evidence against assigning an extremely low probability. However, this doesn't fundamentally change the base rate picture. Factors preventing a higher forecast: (1) the 10-year historical record is unambiguous and stable; (2) Africa has lower air traffic density than other regions; (3) NUFORC is US-based with potentially limited awareness among African pilots; (4) no evidence suggests June 2025 will differ from typical months. Factors preventing a lower forecast: (1) the recent Rwanda sighting demonstrates active reporting; (2) 54 countries provide substantial geographic coverage; (3) improving internet connectivity may facilitate reporting; (4) the outcome isn't impossible, just statistically rare. I would update upward with evidence of: additional African pilot reports in April-May 2025, increased aviation activity, or heightened UAP awareness in African aviation circles. I would update downward if: the historical reports were concentrated in specific periods now passed, or no African reports emerge in the next few months.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill a pilot report of UFOs come from a country in Africa in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFor example, the resolution source [reports](https://nuforc.org/sighting/?id=186297) a 4 craft inline formation of UFOs having been sighted on January 1, 2025 in Rwanda.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts a pilot report of a UFO/UAP having occurred in a country on the African continent, during the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nA historical analysis of the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) database from 2015 to 2024 identified between four and six pilot reports originating from Africa over the ten-year period. The specific countries mentioned for these past reports include South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Rwanda. Globally, pilot reports typically account for approximately 1% of the 5,000 to 6,000 total UFO sightings logged by NUFORC annually.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
