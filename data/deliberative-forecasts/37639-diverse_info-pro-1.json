    "review": "My initial forecast was strongly anchored to the federal court's temporary restraining order (TRO), which I saw as a major barrier to deportation. Forecaster 2 provided a crucial piece of additional information: the role of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). Their point that a timely appeal to the BIA generally triggers an automatic stay of removal is a powerful argument for the 'No' outcome. This adds a second, independent, and very significant procedural barrier running in parallel to the federal court case. Forecaster 3's analysis correctly highlights the strong political will from the executive branch to deport Mr. Khalil, which is the primary driver for any potential 'Yes' outcome. However, I find Forecaster 3's 40% forecast to be an overestimation of the executive's ability to overcome concrete, time-consuming legal procedures within a 48-day window. Forecaster 2's reasoning, which balances the strong procedural defaults (BIA stay, court challenges) against the non-zero chance of expedited review on national security grounds, is the most convincing. Their analysis provides better-specified mechanisms for both the 'Yes' and 'No' scenarios.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast from 5% to 10%. My initial reasoning, based on the federal court's TRO, remains valid. The information from Forecaster 2 about the automatic stay of removal pending a BIA appeal strengthens the case for the 'No' outcome, as it creates another significant legal barrier that must be cleared before the July 1 deadline. However, both other forecasters correctly emphasized the political pressure and national security context of the case, which I may have initially underweight. This pressure increases the likelihood that the government will seek and potentially be granted expedited review from the BIA, and it could lead to a more aggressive litigation strategy in federal court. While I believe the combination of two separate legal stays makes deportation within 48 days highly improbable, I am increasing my forecast to 10% to better reflect the non-trivial chance that this intense executive branch pressure could successfully compress the legal timeline in an extraordinary way. This brings my forecast closer to Forecaster 2's, whose reasoning I found most compelling.",
