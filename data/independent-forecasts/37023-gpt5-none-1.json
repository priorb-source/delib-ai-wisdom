    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Roughly 2–3 weeks until the preliminary May 2025 reading (mid-May). Final May reading about 4–5 weeks from now; preliminary will suffice to resolve.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — if nothing meaningfully changes from April’s 50.8, the May figure would be at or below 50.8, which does not meet the “greater than 50.8” threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Gas prices keep edging up, equities remain soft, and inflation headlines stay hot. Consumers’ inflation expectations tick higher and buying conditions for durables remain poor, nudging the index to 50.8 or lower.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mean reversion from an extreme low: gas prices stabilize or dip, markets calm or rebound, and Fed rhetoric turns slightly less hawkish. Even a modest bounce lifts the index to the low- to mid-50s, clearing 50.8.",
    "rationale": "- Framing: The question resolves Yes if May’s University of Michigan Index of Consumer Sentiment is greater than 50.8 (preliminary is sufficient). April printed 50.8, reported as the second-lowest on record. \n- Status quo anchoring: Good forecasting practice gives extra weight to the status quo. If conditions broadly persist, the most natural outcome is a similar reading (≈50–51), which would lean No given the strict “>50.8” threshold. \n- Mean reversion from extremes: April’s level is extraordinarily depressed. Historically, when sentiment hits extreme lows, subsequent months more often see a rebound than another sharp leg down, absent a fresh shock. The floor is also somewhat binding (the all-time low is near 50), so downside room is limited versus upside scope for a small bounce that would clear 50.8. \n- Short-term drivers into mid-May: Gasoline prices and inflation expectations are key. If pump prices stabilize and equity markets steady, a 1–3 point bounce is plausible. Conversely, another bout of hot inflation news, hawkish rate expectations, or risk-off markets could keep sentiment pinned. The preliminary May figure typically arrives before the full CPI read filters into the public narrative, so real-time price experience and market tone may matter more than official data. \n- Why not higher: Q1 2025 inflation was persistently hot and rate-cut hopes have been pushed back. Gas prices are seasonally firm into spring. These headwinds cap the size of any rebound and make a fresh low conceivable. \n- Why not lower: Given April’s proximity to the historical floor, pushing materially below 50.8 likely requires an additional negative shock (e.g., another oil spike or a sharp equity selloff). In the absence of that, regression to the mean and noise favor a slight uptick. \n- Update triggers: I would raise the probability if, by early May, national average gasoline prices roll over, equities rebound, and financial conditions ease. I would lower it if oil prices spike further, equities fall materially, jobless claims trend up, or inflation expectations in other surveys tick higher. \n- Research assistant input: None beyond the provided background; no contradictory information to adjust the baseline view.\nNetting these considerations, I lean toward a small bounce above 50.8 but keep the edge modest due to ongoing inflation/rates pressure and the proximity to the record low.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the May 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment number be greater than it was for April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCNN: [US consumer sentiment plummets to second-lowest level on records going back to 1952](https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/11/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-april/index.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be located [here](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/), is greater than 50.8 for May 2025. Less than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\nPreliminary results are sufficient to resolve the question. If there is any confusion about the number, Metaculus will resolve based on whatever number is posted at [this pdf](http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/files/tbcics.pdf) that is labelled as May 2025, including preliminary. For example, on April 11, 2025 the number displayed was 50.8 for April 2025 (P).\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
