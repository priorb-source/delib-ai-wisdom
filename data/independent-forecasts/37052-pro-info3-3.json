  "information": "In Latin America, the Venezuelan government has offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of opposition leader Edmundo González, accusing him of inciting a coup following a disputed election in 2024. In Brazil, former President Jair Bolsonaro is reportedly preparing to present legal arguments to defend himself against accusations of leading a coup plot. The World Bank has revised its economic growth projections for Latin America downward to 2.1% for 2025. According to the agents' analysis, there have been no reported coup attempts in Latin America so far in 2025.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No successful coup occurs in Africa or Latin America.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite ongoing political tensions and instability in regions like the Sahel and specific countries like Venezuela, no group successfully overthrows a sitting executive before the July 1, 2025 deadline. Any coup plots are thwarted, or attempts fail to secure control of the state apparatus.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A military junta in a politically fragile Sahelian nation, citing the government's failure to contain an insurgency, successfully seizes power. Alternatively, an incumbent leader in Latin America, facing an unfavorable election result, utilizes elements of the state to illegally remain in power, constituting a successful self-coup confirmed by credible media.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on a high recent base rate of coups, primarily in Africa, tempered by the very short timeframe of just over two months. \n\nAnalysis of Base Rate: The background information highlights a significant 'coup belt' in Africa's Sahel region, with at least seven successful coups since 2020 (Mali x2, Guinea, Burkina Faso x2, Niger, Gabon). This establishes an annual rate of well over one successful coup per year in Africa alone. In contrast, recent coup attempts in Latin America (Peru, Brazil, Bolivia) have been unsuccessful, suggesting a lower probability of a successful event in that region, though the risk is not zero. \n\nKey Regional Factors: The underlying drivers of coups in the Sahel—persistent insecurity from jihadist insurgencies, poor governance, economic hardship, and geopolitical shifts—remain firmly in place, creating a persistently volatile environment where further takeovers are plausible. In Latin America, the research assistant's report of high tensions in Venezuela following a disputed election presents the most likely, though still improbable, path to a 'Yes' outcome, likely through a self-coup as defined by the resolution criteria.\n\nWhy not higher than 30%? The primary constraint is the very short time window. Coups are major political ruptures that, while frequent in some regions on a multi-year timescale, are still rare events on any given day. A period of just over two months significantly lowers the probability of such an event occurring compared to a full year.\n\nWhy not lower than 30%? Ignoring the high demonstrated frequency of coups in the Sahel would be a mistake. The conditions are ripe, and the pattern of 'coup contagion' in the region has been clearly established. A probability below 20% would understate the fragility of several governments in West and Central Africa.\n\nI would increase my forecast upon receiving credible reports of unusual military deployments in a capital city, the arrest of a head of state, or a clear move by an incumbent to unconstitutionally retain power. I would decrease my forecast as the deadline approaches without such incidents, or if there is a significant de-escalation of a major political crisis in a high-risk country.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be a successful coup in Africa or Latin America before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to [Powell & Thyne (2011, p. 252)](https://www.uky.edu/~clthyn2/powell-thyne-JPR-2011.pdf), a coup is \"illegal and overt attempts by the military or other elites within the state apparatus to unseat the sitting executive.\" In recent years, some of the coups in Africa have been:&#x20;\n\n* [Mali August 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Mali May 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Malian_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Niger March 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Nigerien_coup_attempt) (attempt)\n* [Niger July 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Nigerien_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Gabon August 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Gabonese_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Chad January 2025](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_N%27Djamena_attack) (possible attempt)\n* [Burkina Faso January 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n* [Burkina Faso September 2022](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2022_Burkina_Faso_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)&#x20;\n* [Guinea September 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Guinean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat)\n\nLatin America has had the following coup attempts in recent years:\n\n* [Peru self-coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Peruvian_self-coup_attempt), December 2022\n* [Brazil Congress attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Brazilian_Congress_attack), January 2023\n* [Bolivia coup attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Bolivian_coup_attempt), June 2024\n\nSee also: [VoA by the numbers Coups in Africa](https://projects.voanews.com/african-coups/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is a successful coup d’état in any country on the African continent or Latin America before July 1, 2025, according to credible media reports. If this does not occur, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nLatin America is defined as any country in North America or South America whose primary language is Spanish, Portuguese or French.\n\nA coup d’état (often shortened to \"coup\") is [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_d'%C3%A9tat) as an event in which a state's military or other components of its power structure overthrow the existing political authority.&#x20;\n\nA \"successful\" coup is defined as a coup in which the group or person attempting to seize power establishes control over both the government and military, and will be considered to have succeeded once any significant resistance to their authority has ceased.&#x20;\n\nA self-coup, [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-coup) as a political leader, having come to power through legal means, remaining in power through illegal means, will count. This includes scenarios in which an incumbent leader refuses to relinquish power after an election.\n\nExternal support for a coup, such as is described [here](https://africacenter.org/spotlight/africas-coups-and-the-role-of-external-actors/), will count as long as the mercenaries or other external actors are acting in support of a perpetrator from within the state.\n\nCivil wars, mutinies, rebellions or popular uprisings will not count, nor will changes to a country's constitution that restrict a country's democratic norms.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn Latin America, the Venezuelan government has offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of opposition leader Edmundo González, accusing him of inciting a coup following a disputed election in 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
