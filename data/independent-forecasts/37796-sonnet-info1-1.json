  "information": "Several jurisdictions on the FATF grey list are actively seeking removal. The Nigerian government is working to exit the list by the end of May 2025, with its Minister of Interior emphasizing the administration's commitment to improving financial transparency. South Africa's National Treasury has stated that the country has addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 action items and aims to resolve the remaining two by June 2025, for a potential exit from the list by October 2025. Mozambique completed its technical reforms, and an FATF on-site visit, which is a prerequisite for removal, reportedly took place in April 2025 with positive feedback.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 3-4 weeks until the FATF June 2025 Plenary meeting, with the outcome typically announced shortly after the meeting concludes",
    "status_quo_outcome": "NO - The grey list remains unchanged with the same 25 jurisdictions that are currently listed",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite active efforts from Nigeria, South Africa, and Mozambique, none of these countries fully complete their action plans in time for the June plenary. The FATF determines that remaining deficiencies still exist, and no new jurisdictions are identified for addition to the list. The list remains identical to its current composition.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one of the countries making active progress (Nigeria, Mozambique, or potentially others) successfully completes all required action items and receives FATF approval for removal at the June plenary. Alternatively or additionally, FATF identifies one or more new jurisdictions with strategic AML/CFT deficiencies and adds them to the grey list.",
    "rationale": "The evidence suggests a fairly high probability of change. The February 2025 plenary just occurred three months ago and resulted in changes (Philippines removed, Laos and Nepal added), demonstrating that the FATF grey list is actively managed and regularly updated. Multiple jurisdictions are working toward removal: Nigeria explicitly targets exit by end of May 2025 and is prioritizing this work; Mozambique completed an on-site visit in April 2025 with reportedly positive feedback, which is a key prerequisite for removal; South Africa has addressed 20 of 22 action items, though their stated timeline targets October 2025 rather than June. The historical pattern shows that changes to the grey list occur at most FATF plenaries - the system is designed to be dynamic, removing countries that address deficiencies and adding those newly identified with problems. The question resolution allows for ANY change (addition OR removal), which increases the probability. However, I'm not forecasting higher because: even countries with strong progress may not have fully completed all requirements by June; South Africa's own timeline suggests they're targeting October; and Nigeria's 'end of May' target doesn't guarantee June plenary approval. I'm not forecasting lower because: multiple countries show concrete progress; historical precedent strongly supports regular changes; the broad criteria (any addition or removal) makes a positive resolution more likely; and three months between plenaries provides sufficient time for countries to complete remaining action items. I would revise upward if we saw official confirmation that Nigeria or Mozambique completed all action items, or reports of new countries under FATF review. I would revise downward if reports emerged that these countries still have significant outstanding issues.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring\" list, which at the time of this question consists of Algeria, Angola, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Croatia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Haiti, Kenya, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Mali, Monaco, Mozambique, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Venezuela, Vietnam, and Yemen. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nSeveral jurisdictions on the FATF grey list are actively seeking removal. The Nigerian government is working to exit the list by the end of May 2025, with its Minister of Interior emphasizing the administration's commitment to improving financial transparency.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
