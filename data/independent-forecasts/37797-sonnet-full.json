  "information": "Following its plenary meeting in Paris from February 17-21, 2025, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) announced no changes to its 'black list' of High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action, which continues to include North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar. During the same plenary, Laos and Nepal were added to the 'grey list' of jurisdictions under increased monitoring, while the Philippines was removed. The FATF also maintained the suspension of Russia's membership, which has been in place since February 2023, without adding the country to either the grey or black lists.\n\nIn February 2025, South Africa's National Treasury reported that the country had addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 FATF action items, with the remaining two expected to be resolved by June 2025. The goal is to facilitate an exit from the grey list by October 2025. In West Africa, a May 2025 meeting of the GIABA Ministerial Committee noted that Senegal had exited the FATF grey list in October 2024. However, four other regional members—Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Côte d'Ivoire—remain on the grey list, with Nigeria's government stating an aim to be removed by the end of May 2025.\n\nIndian government officials announced in May 2025 their intention to submit fresh intelligence to the FATF concerning terrorist infrastructure operating within Pakistan. This development follows Pakistan's removal from the FATF Grey List in October 2022. At the time of its removal, the FATF noted that Pakistan should continue working with the Asia Pacific Group (APG) to improve its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing systems. Separately, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also recently advised Pakistan to enhance its AML/CFT effectiveness.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2-4 weeks. The FATF June 2025 plenary meeting should occur in early-to-mid June, with the outcome known shortly after the meeting concludes, likely by late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The FATF maintains its black list unchanged at the June 2025 plenary, keeping North Korea, Myanmar, and Iran as the only three jurisdictions designated as High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action, with no additions or removals.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The FATF either removes one of the three current black list countries (North Korea, Myanmar, or Iran) due to significant improvements in their AML/CFT frameworks, or adds a new jurisdiction to the black list, such as Pakistan following India's submission of intelligence regarding terrorist infrastructure, or Russia if its suspended membership status is converted to a formal blacklisting.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors no changes to the black list. Most recently, at the February 2025 plenary (just 3 months ago), FATF made no changes to the black list despite various geopolitical developments, establishing a recent precedent. Historically, the black list designation is reserved for the most serious cases and changes are rare - it requires either severe deterioration or substantial sustained improvement in a country's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing systems.\n\nThe three current black list members face deep structural challenges: North Korea remains internationally isolated, Myanmar continues dealing with post-coup instability, and Iran faces ongoing international sanctions. None show signs of imminent removal. Regarding potential additions, while India plans to submit intelligence about Pakistan, this seems more likely to affect grey list status rather than warranting immediate black list designation, especially since Pakistan was only removed from the grey list in October 2022. Russia's membership has been suspended since February 2023, but FATF has not moved to formally blacklist it despite this extended period.\n\nThe research shows more activity on the grey list (Laos and Nepal added, Philippines removed in February 2025), which is consistent with the pattern that grey list changes are more frequent than black list changes. The fact that multiple countries are working toward grey list exit (South Africa, Nigeria) but none appear close to black list exit further supports the stability of the black list.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because: (1) the strong status quo bias and recent precedent from February 2025, (2) black list changes require extraordinary circumstances, (3) no clear evidence of imminent major developments, (4) the typical inertia in international financial regulatory bodies. My forecast is not lower because: (1) we cannot rule out surprise geopolitical developments in the 2-4 weeks before the plenary, (2) the Pakistan-India intelligence situation could escalate, (3) Russia's status remains uncertain, (4) some probability must be assigned to unexpected developments we're not currently aware of.\n\nI would update higher if: credible reports emerge of Pakistan's situation deteriorating significantly, Russia facing formal blacklisting, or any current member showing dramatic improvement. I would update lower if: official pre-plenary statements suggest no changes are being considered, or if we get closer to the plenary date with no new developments.",
