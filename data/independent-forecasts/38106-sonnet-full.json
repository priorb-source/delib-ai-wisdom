  "information": "A Russian delegation is scheduled to visit Istanbul on June 2, 2025, for a second round of peace talks with Ukraine. Kremlin Spokesman Dmitriy Peskov stated that a high-level summit involving President Trump would depend on the achievement of results from these direct talks between the two delegations. Russia proposed the June 2 date, following a previous meeting on May 16. The United States will not send an official delegation, but White House press secretary Caroline Levitt said, 'We will let you know if the President has plans to send a representative.'\n\nIn February 2025, there was media speculation, particularly from French sources, about a potential visit by Donald Trump to Moscow for the Victory Day celebrations on May 9, 2025. Former Russian Prime Minister Sergey Stepanov commented at the time that such a visit would be a 'big sensation.' On February 12, 2025, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a 1.5-hour phone call during which they agreed to a personal meeting and extended mutual invitations to Washington and Moscow. The speculated May 9 visit did not occur.\n\nIn late May 2025, following a major Russian drone and missile attack in Ukraine, President Donald Trump referred to President Vladimir Putin as 'absolutely crazy.' In a separate statement, Trump also expressed his disappointment with Putin's continued attacks, saying, 'I am very disappointed, very, very disappointed.' Trump indicated he would observe Russia's intentions over a two-week period to determine if they were genuine about achieving peace.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 31 days remain until July 1, 2025. The question resolves based on whether Trump personally visits Russia between now and June 30, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Trump has not visited Russia during his current presidency and has no announced plans to do so.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump does not visit Russia before July 1, 2025. Peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian delegations proceed in Istanbul on June 2 without high-level summit. Tensions remain elevated following recent Russian attacks. Trump maintains diplomatic distance while monitoring the situation. Any potential visit is delayed beyond the July 1 deadline or doesn't materialize at all.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The June 2 Istanbul talks produce a significant breakthrough. Within days, Kremlin and White House announce a Trump-Putin summit in Moscow. Trump makes a brief diplomatic visit to Russia in mid-to-late June to finalize a peace agreement or conduct urgent negotiations. The visit occurs despite recent tensions, justified as necessary for peace.",
    "rationale": "The base rate strongly favors 'No.' Trump has not visited Russia during his presidency despite prior speculation (the May 9 Victory Day visit did not occur). Only 31 days remain, and there are no announced plans for such a visit. Recent events point away from a visit: Trump publicly called Putin 'absolutely crazy' and expressed strong disappointment after Russian attacks on Ukraine in late May. Trump stated he would observe Russia's behavior over a two-week period, suggesting a wait-and-see approach rather than immediate diplomatic engagement. The Istanbul talks on June 2 involve delegations, not heads of state, and the US is not sending an official delegation. Peskov indicated a Trump summit would depend on results from these lower-level talks first. However, the probability is not zero because: (1) Trump and Putin agreed in February to meet and exchanged invitations to Moscow and Washington; (2) diplomatic situations can evolve rapidly, especially with unpredictable leaders; (3) 31 days provides sufficient time logistically if political will exists; (4) a major breakthrough in talks could catalyze quick summit planning. The forecast is not higher because status quo bias is powerful—the world changes slowly most of the time. The pattern shows speculation about Trump-Russia meetings not materializing. Recent tensions make imminent reconciliation unlikely. The forecast is not lower because complete impossibility would be overconfident given Trump's unpredictability and the ongoing peace process. To update higher, I would need: concrete announcement of visit, major diplomatic breakthrough, or warming of relations. To update lower: further time passing without movement, escalation of conflict, or Trump's continued criticism.",
