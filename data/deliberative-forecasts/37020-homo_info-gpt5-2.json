    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the multiple-paths logic: with four nominations, Malone has several outs (Single, Music Event, Video, possibly Song), and ACMs often reward commercial juggernauts—points I largely share. Forecaster 2 adds a useful base-rate frame (multi-nominees usually win something) and highlights category-correlation risk, which is important. However, their claim that Malone has an Album of the Year nod for F-1 Trillion is uncertain; if that’s incorrect, their 72% may be a bit high. Forecaster 3’s argument is balanced, noting ACM receptivity to radio hits while acknowledging entrenched competition and crossover skepticism. Neither brought decisive new insider/betting signals, but the base-rate emphasis slightly strengthens a Yes lean. Overall, the arguments are directionally convincing, with a small upward nudge warranted; I discount the Album claim until verified.",
    "rationale": "Key considerations remain: (1) Four nominations materially lift the at-least-one-win chance; (2) I Had Some Help was one of the year’s defining commercial singles, and ACM voters have historically been comfortable rewarding blockbuster radio records, especially in Single/Music Event/Video; (3) Risks are correlated—if voters bristle at a high-profile crossover or prefer core-country rivals, a shutout across linked categories is plausible; (4) Competition is strong (Lainey Wilson, Zach Bryan, Luke Combs, Morgan Wallen), keeping ceilings in check. The other forecasters’ base-rate argument marginally increases my confidence, but the unverified Album of the Year nomination tempers a bigger move. Net: modest uptick from my prior 62% to reflect multi-nominee base rates without over-weighting possibly incorrect nomination info.",
