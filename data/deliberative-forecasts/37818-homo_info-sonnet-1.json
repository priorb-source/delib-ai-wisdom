    "review": "The forecasters raised several critical points I hadn't adequately considered. Most importantly, Forecaster 3 provides crucial historical context that Florida is consistently a top-2 state for pilot reports alongside California, leading roughly 30-35% of months. This is dramatically different from my implicit assumption of a ~2% base rate across 50 states. Forecaster 3 also highlights the small monthly sample sizes (8-12 pilot reports nationwide), which creates substantial random variation - this makes Florida's chances of leading in any given month much higher than I initially estimated. Forecaster 2 appears to reference information not in my research assistant's report (Florida's 8,623 total reports, a March 2025 incident), which I cannot fully evaluate, but the emphasis on Florida's strong overall position is consistent with Forecaster 3's historical data. However, I note that my research assistant specifically identified Arizona as a recent hotspot with 22 Air Force pilot reports over 8 months, suggesting competition beyond just California-Florida. The forecasters' analyses don't address this Arizona data point.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I significantly underestimated Florida's baseline probability. My original 18% forecast treated this as a near-random draw among 50 states, but if historical data shows Florida consistently leads 30-35% of months as a top-2 contender, I was far too conservative. The small monthly sample sizes (8-12 reports nationwide) mean that even historical patterns have high variance, supporting the argument for Florida having a realistic chance. However, I'm updating with some caution because: (1) I cannot independently verify the historical data cited by Forecaster 3, (2) my research assistant highlighted Arizona as a recent military aviation hotspot, suggesting the competitive landscape may be shifting, and (3) Forecaster 2 references information I wasn't provided, creating uncertainty about what the true baseline is. Balancing Forecaster 3's compelling historical argument (30-35% historical rate) against these uncertainties, I'm updating to 30%. This reflects Florida as a genuine top contender with a realistic chance of leading in any given month, while acknowledging some uncertainty about whether the historical pattern will hold and accounting for potential competition from other aviation-heavy states.",
