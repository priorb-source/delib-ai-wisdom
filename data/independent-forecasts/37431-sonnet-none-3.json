    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 57 days from today (May 5, 2025) until the resolution date of July 1, 2025. The recall was issued on April 24, 2025, giving a total window of approximately 68 days from issuance to resolution date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the recall remains Active past July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The recall remains Active because product recovery is incomplete. Despite initial efforts, the 65,000 pounds of pork buns were distributed to multiple retailers or food service locations, and coordinating the complete removal from commerce takes longer than expected. FSIS continues monitoring recovery efforts and doesn't close the recall until they're satisfied all affected product has been accounted for, which extends beyond July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recall is Closed before July 1 because ACC Central Kitchen LLC and distributors acted swiftly to recover the product. The distribution was relatively limited, making recovery efficient. Within 4-6 weeks of the April 24 issuance, FSIS determines that adequate corrective actions have been taken, the product has been substantially removed from commerce, and the health hazard has been adequately addressed, allowing them to close the recall by mid-to-late June.",
    "rationale": "This forecast centers on understanding typical USDA/FSIS recall closure timelines. The key factors are: (1) Time window: 68 days from issuance to resolution is relatively short for recalls. (2) Recall type: This is an allergen/misbranding recall for undeclared allergens, which are typically Class I (serious health hazard) and receive priority attention. (3) Size: 65,000 pounds is a moderate-sized recall - substantial enough to require coordinated recovery efforts but not massive. Generally, food recalls take 2-4+ months to close depending on distribution scope, recovery effectiveness, and FSIS's assessment of risk mitigation. Some factors favor closure: allergen recalls often get urgent attention, and the relatively moderate size may allow faster recovery. Factors against closure: 68 days is on the shorter end of typical recall timelines, and FSIS must verify adequate product recovery before closure. The status quo strongly favors recalls remaining Active since systematic recovery and verification processes take time. My research assistant provided no additional information to adjust from baseline expectations. For me to forecast higher (50%+), I would need evidence of: limited distribution, rapid initial recovery progress, or data showing most allergen recalls close within 60-70 days. For me to forecast lower (20-30%), I would need evidence of: widespread distribution, complex recovery challenges, or that this company has had prior compliance issues. Given the time constraints and typical recall patterns, I estimate a 38% probability of closure before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by ACC Central Kitchen LLC of pork bun products issued April 24, 2025 be closed before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nConsumerAffairs: [Nearly 65,000 pounds of pork buns recalled for undeclared allergen](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/nearly-65000-pounds-of-pork-buns-recalled-for-undeclared-allergen-042525.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/acc-central-kitchen-llc-recalls-pork-bun-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before July 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
