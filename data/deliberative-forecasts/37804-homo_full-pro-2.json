    "review": "My initial forecast (25%) was heavily weighted toward a 'No' outcome, driven by the explicit political directive from the HHS Secretary and the low administrative barrier to pulling a webpage. Forecaster 2 (85%) and Forecaster 3 (60%) presented a compelling counterargument centered on the immense power of institutional inertia. They correctly pointed out that even simple administrative actions in a large federal agency like the CDC are subject to procedural requirements and bureaucratic friction that can easily cause delays, especially over a short, sub-seven-week timeline. This is a crucial point I had underestimated. I was too focused on the political actor's intent and not enough on the structural realities of the system they are trying to influence. Their reasoning convinced me that the status quo is more resilient than I first assessed, and that my initial probability was too aggressive.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am updating my forecast. I find their shared emphasis on institutional inertia to be a critical and convincing counterpoint to my initial assessment. The federal bureaucracy's resistance to rapid change, even for seemingly simple administrative tasks, is a powerful force that I had undervalued. An order from the HHS Secretary to the CDC is not self-executing; it must be processed through legal, communications, and administrative channels, offering opportunities for delay by career staff who may be resistant to what they see as political interference in scientific guidance. This institutional friction makes the status quo ('Yes') a much more plausible outcome by the July 1 deadline. However, I am not moving my forecast as high as my peers. I maintain that this situation is exceptional. The pressure is not a vague political preference but an explicit, public directive from the head of the department, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for whom this issue is a signature cause. This creates a powerful incentive to overcome bureaucratic hurdles quickly. The resolution hinges on a race between this focused political will and the diffuse friction of the bureaucracy. I had previously seen the political will as a clear favorite. I now see it as a much closer race. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast for a 'Yes' outcome significantly, from 25% to 45%. This reflects a substantial shift based on my colleagues' arguments, while still maintaining my view that a politically-driven removal of the recommendation ('No') remains slightly more probable than not.",
