    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months, with the resolution date being July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The People's Republic of China (PRC) continues its campaign of military pressure and gray-zone tactics against Taiwan, but does not launch a full-scale ground invasion. The United States does not accuse China of an invasion because one has not occurred.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The PRC leadership determines that the costs and risks of an invasion—including devastating international sanctions, a potential military quagmire, and direct conflict with the United States and its allies—far outweigh the benefits. Beijing continues its current strategy of intimidation and political coercion, waiting for a more opportune moment or a peaceful path to unification. The deadline of July 1, 2025 passes without a ground invasion.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A severe miscalculation or a major trigger event, such as a Taiwanese declaration of independence or a military accident in the Strait that rapidly escalates, prompts the PRC leadership to launch a surprise amphibious and airborne assault. PLA ground forces land on Taiwanese territory without consent from Taipei. Observing this overt act of aggression through satellite and other intelligence, the US President or Secretary of State publicly condemns the action and officially accuses the PRC of invading Taiwan.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is overwhelmingly guided by the immense military, economic, and geopolitical costs China would face in any invasion attempt, coupled with the extremely short timeframe for this question. The status quo, while tense, is far more stable than a state of open warfare.\n\nFirst, a full-scale amphibious invasion of Taiwan is one of the most complex and difficult military operations conceivable. It would require a massive, observable mobilization of troops, ships, and supplies that would be detected weeks, if not months, in advance. As of today, there are no public, credible reports of such final-stage preparations. Undertaking such an operation in under two months without these clear indicators is operationally improbable.\n\nSecond, the economic consequences for the PRC would be catastrophic. A war would trigger severe, coordinated international sanctions, sever China from global financial markets, and collapse its export-oriented economy. The disruption to global shipping and semiconductor supply chains (in which Taiwan is a critical node) would plunge the world into a recession, but China's economy would be hit the hardest, posing a significant threat to the CCP's domestic stability.\n\nThird, the risk of a direct military conflict with the United States and its allies (notably Japan) remains the most significant deterrent. Even if a Chinese victory were possible, the cost in blood and treasure would be staggering and could permanently cripple the PLA.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 2% because the situation is volatile. An unforeseen event, a political crisis in Beijing leading to a rash decision, or a rapid escalation from a skirmish could still, in a low-probability scenario, lead to an invasion. The constant military posturing and aggressive rhetoric create a baseline level of risk that cannot be dismissed entirely.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 2% because the structural barriers to an invasion are immense and the short time horizon makes it logistically infeasible without prior warning signs that are currently absent. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see credible intelligence of large-scale troop and naval embarkation drills, a significant escalation in official state rhetoric to prepare the Chinese populace for war, or a declaration of independence from Taipei.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States accuse the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCFR: [Why China-Taiwan Relations Are So Tense](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-taiwan-relations-tension-us-policy-trump)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the US government publicly accuses the People's Republic of China of invading Taiwan by sending its ground military forces into Taiwan without consent from the Taiwanese government in Taipei.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
