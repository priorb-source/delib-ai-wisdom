    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new legislation is enacted, and Ohio's existing voter registration requirements, which do not require documentary proof of citizenship, remain unchanged.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Ohio General Assembly focuses its efforts on passing the state's biennial budget before its own June 30 deadline. A bill to expand citizenship verification requirements either stalls in committee or does not have enough time to pass both chambers before the question's resolution date of July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capitalizing on their party's control of the House, Senate, and Governorship, Republican legislative leaders attach the citizenship verification proposal as an amendment to a must-pass piece of legislation, such as the state budget bill. This allows the provision to bypass the standard committee process and be quickly passed by both chambers before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the significant procedural and time constraints facing the Ohio legislature. With a deadline of July 1, 2025, there are less than two months for a new bill to be introduced, vetted by committees in both the House and Senate, and passed on the floor of both chambers. This is an exceptionally fast timeline for any piece of legislation, let alone a potentially controversial one.\n\nThe single greatest obstacle is the state's biennial budget, which constitutionally must be passed by June 30. This process will dominate the legislative calendar and consume the majority of political capital and floor time, leaving little room for other priorities. The status quo, in which no new legislation is passed, is the most likely outcome due to simple legislative inertia.\n\nHowever, the probability is not zero. Ohio has a Republican trifecta, and there is clear interest within the majority party to enact stricter voting laws, as evidenced by the previous introduction of similar bills. The most plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome would be for supporters to bypass the standard legislative process by attaching the provision to the must-pass budget bill. This maneuver would accelerate the timeline dramatically.\n\nI am forecasting a low probability because the budget process itself is complex, and adding controversial non-germane amendments can sometimes threaten the passage of the main bill. Therefore, leadership may be hesitant to take this risk. My forecast is not lower than 15% to account for the real possibility of this legislative tactic being used in a state with a unified Republican government. My forecast would increase if legislative leaders publicly commit to passing such a bill before July 1 or if it is successfully added as an amendment to the budget bill early in the process. Conversely, my forecast would decrease as each week passes without any significant legislative action on this issue.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Ohio enact legislation expanding its verification requirements of a voter's citizenship?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Ohio Senate: [Gavarone, Brenner Introduce Bill to Require Proof of Citizenship to Vote](https://ohiosenate.gov/members/theresa-gavarone/news/gavarone-brenner-introduce-bill-to-require-proof-of-citizenship-to-vote)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the state of Ohio enacts legislation requiring voters to provide proof of US citizenship beyond the requirements at the time of this question, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nAny subset of voters being required to provide such proof would count (for example if it only applied to first-time voter registrants or creating a new requirement for mail-in voters). An example of a bill that would count is [Senate Bill 153](https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/136/sb153). This question resolves upon enactment; therefore other questions such as when the legislation takes effect or whether it survives court challenges and is implemented is immaterial to this question's resolution. Please note that under Ohio law, a bill is considered enacted \"after both houses have passed and agreed on identical bills.\" ([Source](https://www.lsc.ohio.gov/assets/organizations/legislative-service-commission/files/chapter-5-enacting-legislation-10021971.pdf))\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
