    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months, with the final outcome known by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Absent any major economic shocks, the currency markets remain relatively stable. The interest rate differential between the US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank does not change dramatically in the Euro's favor, and the US economy avoids a sudden, sharp recession. Under these conditions, the USD/EUR exchange rate fluctuates within its recent range, well above the 0.80 EUR threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A significant, US-specific negative shock occurs. This could be a severe financial crisis, the unexpected failure of a major bank, or a rapid onset of a deep recession. This event would force the Federal Reserve into an emergency monetary easing cycle, drastically cutting interest rates. This would trigger a massive capital flight from the US dollar, causing it to depreciate sharply and fall below the 0.80 EUR mark.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the significant deviation from the current exchange rate required in a very short timeframe. As of today, the USD is valued at approximately 0.92 EUR. For the outcome to be 'Yes', the dollar would need to depreciate by over 13% against the Euro within the resolution window of less than two months (May 12 - July 1, 2025). Such a large and rapid move in a major currency pair like USD/EUR is historically rare and typically requires a major systemic shock. The status quo, which heavily influences my forecast, is that major economies and their currency valuations do not change so drastically without a powerful catalyst. The research assistant provided no information suggesting such a catalyst is imminent. My probability is not lower because unforeseen crises (geopolitical or financial) are always a non-zero possibility, and currency markets can be highly volatile during such events. The 'Tariff Turmoil' mentioned in the background material is a good example of a potential trigger. My probability is not higher because there are currently no clear, observable indicators pointing to the kind of severe, US-centric crisis that would be necessary to cause such a rapid depreciation of the dollar. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see evidence of severe stress in the US financial system, a sharp and unexpected downturn in key US economic data, or a sudden, dramatic, and dovish shift in Federal Reserve policy relative to the ECB.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
