    "review": "The other two forecasters, both at 35%, provided crucial data points that I had not fully considered. Forecaster 2's specific detail that a prior vote garnered 16 'yes' votes quantifies the support for the ban, demonstrating a stronger coalition (50% of owners) than I had initially assumed from the vague report that the vote was 'tabled.' This is a compelling piece of evidence suggesting the 'Yes' camp has significant momentum. Forecaster 3 provided an equally compelling counterpoint: the NFL's health and safety department has no hard data showing the 'Tush-Push' causes an abnormal number of injuries. This undermines the most powerful driver for modern NFL rule changes and strengthens the hand of those defending the status quo. I find both arguments convincing and they complicate the forecast in opposite directions.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am increasing my forecast. My initial 15% was heavily anchored on the very short timeframe and the high supermajority threshold required for a rule change. While those factors remain critical, the new information warrants an adjustment. Forecaster 2's point that the 'Yes' camp already has 16 votes is significant; it shows this is not a fringe movement but an issue with a 50% base of support. Overcoming the inertia of the status quo is easier when you're starting from a 50-50 split rather than from scratch. However, I am not raising my forecast to 35% because I find Forecaster 3's argument about the lack of definitive safety data to be a powerful brake on that momentum. Without a clear player-safety mandate, it is much harder to compel the final 8 owners needed to reach the 24-vote supermajority. Those owners can reasonably argue to wait another season to gather more data. Therefore, while the base of support for a ban is stronger than I first thought, the core argument for it is weaker. I am raising my forecast from 15% to 25% to account for the established political will to ban the play, while still reflecting my belief that the procedural hurdles and lack of a safety imperative make failure the most probable outcome.",
