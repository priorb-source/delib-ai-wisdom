    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling points I initially underweighted. Forecaster 2's observation about the strong late-April rally (+4.6% through Apr 25) is crucial - this mechanically raises the bar for May to close higher than April. Forecaster 3 correctly identifies specific near-term catalysts (Fed meeting May 7, PCE inflation, 180+ earnings reports) that will drive May's outcome. Both anchor closer to the historical ~60% base rate for positive months, while I was at 46%. However, I notice both may be underweighting the significance of the elevated VIX (~25), which Forecaster 2 mentions but doesn't fully incorporate - this suggests higher-than-normal volatility and downside tail risk. The late-April rally creating a higher hurdle is a mechanical headwind both acknowledge but may underweight. Additionally, the tariff/earnings concerns from my research assistant remain relevant fundamental pressures that create genuine downside risk beyond normal market conditions.",
    "rationale": "I need to update upward from 46% but remain more cautious than the 55-56% consensus. The key new information is the late-April rally setting a higher bar for May - this is a mechanical constraint I initially missed. The historical ~60% base rate for positive months is also a stronger anchor than I used. However, several factors warrant staying below the consensus: (1) The elevated VIX of ~25 indicates genuine elevated risk, not just normal market conditions; (2) The late-April rally means May starts from a higher base, reducing probability of further gains; (3) The tariff/earnings headwinds represent real fundamental pressures; (4) Stretched valuations (P/E 19-28) with high volatility create meaningful downside risk. While both forecasters correctly note that fundamentals matter less over one month, the combination of elevated volatility, a higher starting point from April's rally, and genuine policy/earnings uncertainties justifies a forecast below their consensus but above my initial estimate. I'm moving to 51% - acknowledging the upward bias while respecting that current conditions present above-average headwinds.",
