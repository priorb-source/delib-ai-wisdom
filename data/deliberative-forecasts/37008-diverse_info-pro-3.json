    "review": "My initial forecast of 25% was heavily anchored on the state of emergency's official end date of April 29. The other forecasters provided compelling arguments for increasing this probability. Forecaster 2 introduced a crucial piece of evidence I had not considered: Samoa's recent history of implementing rolling monthly extensions of its state of emergency during the COVID-19 pandemic. This precedent of institutional behavior significantly weakens the argument that a stated end date is a firm commitment when a crisis is ongoing. Forecaster 3 sharpened the risk analysis by highlighting that the temporary generators, which are key to alleviating the crisis, are only 'expected' by the end of April, not guaranteed. This adds a specific, high-stakes point of potential failure in the short time remaining. Both analyses convincingly argued that the probability of an extension is substantially higher than I initially estimated.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast upward from 25% to 45%. The primary reason for this 20-point increase is the new information provided by Forecaster 2 regarding Samoa's precedent for extending states of emergency during the prolonged COVID-19 crisis. This demonstrates a willingness to maintain emergency declarations as long as the underlying problem persists, making an extension in this case a very plausible course of action. The uncertainty surrounding the arrival and operational status of the temporary generators, highlighted by Forecaster 3, further supports a higher probability of extension. If these generators are delayed or prove insufficient, the government will likely opt to extend the emergency powers. However, I am not updating to above 50%, as Forecaster 2 did, because of the acute economic pressure. The reported 16% hit to GDP from this power crisis creates a powerful incentive for the government to lift the formal State of Emergency as soon as a minimally viable, temporary solution is in place. This economic factor may differentiate this situation from the pandemic and weigh against an automatic extension. My revised forecast of 45% reflects that the outcome is nearly a coin toss, but with a slight edge to the 'No' case due to the severe economic costs and the explicit end date.",
