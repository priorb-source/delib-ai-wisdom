    "review": "All three forecasters independently identified the same critical evidence and reached very similar conclusions. We all noted: (1) no invitation received as of early June with only 12-14 days until the summit, (2) high-level visits require weeks of advance planning that hasn't happened, (3) Canada invited other countries but not India, (4) significant diplomatic tensions over the Nijjar case, and (5) domestic Canadian opposition from Sikh organizations. No forecaster raised substantive new information or arguments I hadn't considered. The main difference is where we calibrate within the 'very unlikely' range: 3%, 6%, and 10%. Forecaster 3's 10% seems slightly generous given the extreme timeline constraints, while Forecaster 2's 6% represents a reasonable middle ground. The convergence of our reasoning strengthens my confidence that the core analysis is sound, though perhaps I was slightly too extreme at 3%.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I maintain that the fundamental analysis is correct: the combination of no invitation yet, insufficient time for proper security arrangements, diplomatic tensions, and domestic opposition creates overwhelming barriers to Modi's attendance. The 12-14 day timeline is particularly constraining - organizing a Prime Minister's international security detail and logistics in under two weeks would be highly unusual. However, seeing two other forecasters independently arrive at 6% and 10% suggests there may be slightly more room for diplomatic surprises than my initial 3% allowed. While I don't think the probability is as high as 10% - the timeline constraint is genuinely extreme - I acknowledge that diplomatic miracles occasionally happen and both governments have expressed interest in improving relations. A last-minute invitation followed by Modi's acceptance, while requiring extraordinary circumstances, isn't quite as unlikely as 3% suggests. I'm updating to 5% to reflect this slightly wider confidence interval while maintaining that attendance remains highly improbable.",
