    "review": "I have reviewed the analyses from two other forecasters. Forecaster 2 (25%) aligns closely with my initial reasoning, emphasizing that Aaron Rouse is a top-tier contender but not the frontrunner in a crowded field where the vote is likely to be split. The argument framing the race as 'the field versus any single candidate' is compelling and reinforces the idea that no one has an easy path to a majority. Forecaster 3 (40%) introduces the most significant new piece of information: a March 2025 internal poll for the Levar Stoney campaign showing Stoney leading Rouse 16% to 10%, with 63% of voters undecided. While Forecaster 3 interprets the high number of undecideds as evidence that the race is a near toss-up and Rouse's 6-point deficit is easily surmountable, I have a different interpretation. The poll, while two months old and internal, provides the first concrete data backing the narrative suggested by fundraising and endorsements: Stoney is the current, albeit not dominant, frontrunner. I find Forecaster 3's reasoning for a 40% forecast to be too optimistic for Rouse's position, as it seems to underweight the advantage Stoney possesses by having both a polling lead and a significant fundraising advantage to persuade a large portion of those undecided voters in the campaign's final weeks.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I am maintaining my forecast of 30%. The input from the other forecasters was valuable, particularly the specific poll data provided by Forecaster 3. This data confirms my initial qualitative assessment: Levar Stoney is the frontrunner, and Aaron Rouse is a strong challenger in a fluid race. However, I disagree with the conclusion that this makes Rouse's chances as high as 40%. The combination of a polling lead (Stoney 16%, Rouse 10%) and a significant fundraising lead ($1.4M+) puts Stoney in a superior position to convert the large bloc of undecided voters. Advertising and get-out-the-vote operations in the final three weeks are expensive, and Stoney's campaign is best resourced to execute them. My 30% forecast acknowledges that with 63% of voters undecided, the race is far from over, and Rouse has a clear and plausible path to victory by consolidating his base and winning over a large share of undecideds. However, it also reflects the reality that he is the challenger facing a better-funded frontrunner who has more tools at his disposal to close the deal. Therefore, while Rouse has a substantial chance, Stoney remains the more likely victor.",
