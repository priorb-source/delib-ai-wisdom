    "review": "All three forecasts converge on low probabilities (7-15%), sharing similar reasoning about status quo bias, short timeline, and CDC's conservative approach. Forecaster 3 raises the most compelling new evidence I hadn't explicitly considered: the Brazil 2017-2018 yellow fever outbreak precedent, which remained at Level 2 despite being a substantial outbreak in a major South American country. This historical example strongly supports the view that CDC treats vaccine-preventable, vector-borne diseases differently than novel threats, rarely escalating to Level 3 even during sizable outbreaks. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the vaccine as a 'powerful mitigating factor from the perspective of traveler safety' reinforces why Level 3 (avoid nonessential travel) is hard to justify when effective prevention exists. Both forecasters correctly identify that Level 3 is reserved for exceptional circumstances like Ebola where mitigation is difficult. The Brazil precedent is particularly relevant given the similar disease, geography, and CDC framework. This concrete historical evidence suggests my 12% may be too high.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating downward primarily due to Forecaster 3's Brazil 2017-2018 precedent, which I hadn't explicitly weighted. This historical example demonstrates CDC's framework treats substantial yellow fever outbreaks in South American countries as Level 2 situations, even when sizable. Combined with: (1) the vaccine-preventable nature making Level 3 ('avoid nonessential travel') difficult to justify, (2) the very short 5-6 week timeline preventing gradual escalation, (3) strong institutional status quo bias, and (4) Level 3 being reserved for hard-to-mitigate threats like Ebola, the probability should be lower. However, I'm not going as low as 7% because: (a) the 'economic emergency' framing suggests potential severity beyond typical endemic cases, (b) we lack detailed current outbreak data, and (c) rapid deterioration remains possible even if unlikely. The convergence of all three forecasts in the 7-15% range validates the low-probability assessment, but the Brazil precedent specifically pushes me toward the lower end of that range.",
