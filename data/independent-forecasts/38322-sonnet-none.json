    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 23 days. The final June 2025 Consumer Sentiment report will be released on Friday, June 27, 2025 (the final Friday of June).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the reading will be 54.0 or higher. Consumer sentiment readings below 54.0 would be extraordinarily low historically, occurring only during the most severe economic crises. The status quo suggests that even during periods of significant economic concern, the index typically remains above this threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Consumer sentiment stabilizes in the 55-65 range through June 2025. While tariff concerns may create uncertainty, they don't translate into catastrophic consumer confidence levels. Economic fundamentals like employment remain reasonably stable, preventing sentiment from reaching historically extreme lows. The June final reading comes in at 54.0 or higher.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Tariff impacts accelerate dramatically through June, creating widespread economic disruption. Major layoff announcements, stock market volatility, and deteriorating economic indicators compound consumer fears. The sentiment plunge referenced in the background intensifies, pushing the June final reading below 54.0, which would rank among the lowest readings in the index's history.",
    "rationale": "A reading below 54.0 would be exceptionally rare historically. The University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index has only occasionally dipped to these levels during severe crises like the 2008 financial crisis (low around 55-56). The background mentions tariffs and a sentiment plunge, suggesting genuine downward pressure exists. However, without current data showing we're already near this threshold, and given that it's only early June with three weeks until the final report, the status quo bias strongly favors a more moderate outcome. For the reading to fall below 54.0, we would need sustained, severe negative economic developments throughout June - possible but not the base case. I would need to see evidence of: (1) May 2025 or early June preliminary readings already at/near 54.0, (2) major economic shocks materializing, or (3) tariff impacts being more severe than typical economic disruptions to significantly increase this probability. Conversely, I'd lower the probability with evidence of stabilization or if preliminary June data shows readings comfortably above 60.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the June 2025 University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Final Report number be less than 54.0?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Why the consumer sentiment plunge is different now](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/19/tariffs-consumer-economy-sentiment)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the University of Michigan's reported June Final Results of the Index of Consumer Sentiment, expected to be posted [here](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/reports.php) on the final Friday of June 2025, is less than 54.0 for June 2025. Greater than or equal to that amount resolves the question as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-04.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
