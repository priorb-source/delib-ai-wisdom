    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I reached similar conclusions (98% and 92%), while Forecaster 3 landed much lower at 74%. The key insight from Forecaster 3 that deserves serious consideration is the multiplicative nature of requiring ALL SEVEN countries to remain listed - any single one falling off means No resolution. This structural dependency was implicit in my analysis but deserves more weight.\n\nForecaster 3's identification of Venezuela as the 'highest risk' country is well-reasoned. Venezuela has historically had more intermittent enforcement compared to countries like China or Iran. The distinction between 'current' and 'intermittent' blocking on Wikipedia is important - editors could reclassify based on new evidence without any actual policy change occurring.\n\nHowever, I find Forecaster 3's 74% forecast overly pessimistic for several reasons: (1) The 26-day timeframe is extremely short for Wikipedia editorial changes absent new compelling sources, (2) The fact that all seven are currently listed suggests recent editorial consensus, (3) The research report provides no evidence of access restoration in any of these seven countries, (4) Even for Venezuela, going from 'currently listed' to 'delisted' in under a month would require new sources documenting unblocking AND editors acting on them quickly.\n\nForecaster 2's 98% may be slightly overconfident given the multiplicative structure. If we assigned even a 99% probability to each country remaining listed independently (very generous), that would yield 0.99^7 = 93.2% for all seven.\n\nThe editorial churn risk from Tanzania's new block is interesting but speculative - adding a new country doesn't necessarily trigger review of long-established entries.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing both analyses, I maintain that the short timeframe and established nature of these blocks strongly favor the status quo, but I'm adjusting downward to better account for the multiplicative risk structure that Forecaster 3 highlighted.\n\nThe question requires ALL SEVEN to remain listed. Venezuela represents the primary vulnerability - it has a history of more variable enforcement. However, for it to be removed from Wikipedia's current block list in 26 days would require: (1) new evidence showing unblocking, (2) this evidence being noticed by Wikipedia editors, and (3) editorial consensus to reclassify. None of these seem imminent.\n\nRussia's block is well-established since 2022. The other five (China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Turkmenistan) are exceptionally stable.\n\nI'm lowering my forecast from 92% to 88% to account for: (1) the multiplicative structure requiring all seven to persist, (2) Venezuela's slightly elevated risk of reclassification, and (3) general Wikipedia editorial uncertainty. However, I'm not going as low as 74% because the 26-day window is simply too short for significant editorial changes without strong new evidence, which we lack.",
