  "information": "South Korea has been experiencing significant political instability. President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law in December 2024, leading to his impeachment. The country's Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment on April 4, 2025. Following these events, a snap presidential election has been scheduled for June 3, 2025. Additionally, law enforcement authorities recently conducted a search of former President Yoon's residence as part of corruption allegations.\n\nSeveral large-scale protests have occurred in South Korea in the first half of 2025. On January 4, an estimated 35,000 people protested. On February 2, reports on participant numbers in an anti-Yoon protest ranged from 38,000 to 100,000. On February 15, a rally in Seoul demanding impeachment reportedly involved 300,000 people. On March 29, a protest demanding the president's resignation was estimated at 12,000 participants. On May 1, a Labor Day rally in Seoul organized by the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) had over 8,000 participants, with police estimating attendance as high as 13,000.\n\nMultiple civic and political groups have been actively organizing demonstrations. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) and the Democratic Labor Union held rallies for Labor Day on May 1. The KCTU has also announced its intention to organize a general strike in July. Groups such as 'Free Korea' and 'Candlelight Action' have consistently held rallies and counter-rallies in response to political developments. Conservative groups have also planned a rally for May 18th in Gwangju.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. South Korea is experiencing a period of high political tension following a presidential impeachment, with frequent, large-scale protests regularly exceeding the 10,000-participant threshold as part of the normal political discourse.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The snap presidential election on June 3, 2025, produces a widely accepted result, leading to a significant and rapid de-escalation of political tensions. A post-election 'honeymoon' period ensues, protest fatigue sets in, and no major demonstrations reaching the 10,000 participant threshold occur before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "During the highly charged period leading up to or immediately following the June 3 presidential election, one or more of the active civic, labor, or political groups organizes a protest. Driven by the election outcome, a new political development, or a separate issue, the demonstration attracts over 10,000 participants and is subsequently logged by the Global Protest Tracker.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the extremely high frequency of large-scale protests in South Korea in early 2025. The research provided indicates at least five separate protests between January and May 2025 have met or significantly exceeded the 10,000-participant threshold. This establishes a strong precedent and a high base rate for such events occurring.\n\nThe primary driver of this unrest—the political turmoil surrounding former President Yoon's impeachment and the upcoming snap presidential election on June 3—remains a powerful catalyst. Contentious elections are potent triggers for mass mobilization, both before the vote and in reaction to the results. Established and capable organizations, such as the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) and various 'Candlelight Action' civic groups, have repeatedly demonstrated their ability to organize large crowds, and there is no indication they will cease their activities during this critical political period.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 95% to account for the small possibility of a 'no' outcome. A surprisingly decisive and popular election result could create a brief window of national unity and calm that lasts through the end of June. There is also a slim chance of protest fatigue or a strategic decision by organizers to pause major rallies post-election.\n\nMy probability is not lower because ignoring the clear trend of multiple large protests per month would be an error. For two entire months, including a snap presidential election, to pass without a single protest of this size would require a drastic and unforeseen shift away from the established status quo of political expression in South Korea.\n\nI would revise my forecast downwards if major political factions and civic groups jointly called for and observed a moratorium on protests. I would revise upwards if pre-election polling suggested a highly contested result or if a new major scandal emerged.",
