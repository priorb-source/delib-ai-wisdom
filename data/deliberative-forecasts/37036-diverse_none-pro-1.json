    "review": "The other forecasters both arrived at a forecast of 40%, lower than my initial 65%. Their reasoning was convincing and highlighted several points I had underweight. The most compelling arguments were: (1) The lack of urgency for a 2026 midterm candidate to announce in the spring of 2025, as typical campaign timelines favor a launch in the late summer or fall. (2) The specific framing of an 'exploratory' phase as a genuine off-ramp and deliberative period, not a guaranteed precursor to an imminent launch. (3) The absence of leading indicators for a rollout (e.g., staff hires, FEC filings, scheduled events), which serves as evidence against a planned announcement within the next five weeks. They correctly emphasized that while exploring is a significant positive signal, the status quo (no announcement) and base rates for election timing should be weighted more heavily for such a short resolution window.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 65% was based on the premise that a challenger would want to capitalize on the momentum from an 'exploring' announcement and begin fundraising and campaigning as early as possible. However, the other forecasters' analyses have persuaded me that I overweighted this factor and underweighted the standard strategic timeline for a midterm election. The arguments regarding the lack of urgency and the absence of any logistical signals of an impending launch are particularly strong. Announcing over 18 months before the election is very early, and the 'exploring' phase allows him to gauge support without committing. I am therefore significantly lowering my forecast. I am moving my probability from 65% down to 45%. This represents a major shift from believing an announcement before June 1 was likely to believing it is now less likely than not. I am not going down to 40% because I still place slightly more weight on Osborn's unique circumstances; his recent 2024 independent campaign gives him existing name ID and infrastructure, which could facilitate a faster and earlier-than-normal launch to define the race against a formidable incumbent like Ricketts. However, the deliberators rightly tempered my initial optimism.",
