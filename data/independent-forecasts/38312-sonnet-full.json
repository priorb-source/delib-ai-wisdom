  "information": "As of early June 2025, India has not received an official invitation to the G7 summit scheduled to take place in Canada from June 15-17. Multiple media outlets, including The Tribune and the Hindustan Times, have reported this, citing official sources. These reports indicate that no advance preparations for a high-level visit from India are underway. This is contrary to the protocol for such trips, which are typically planned weeks in advance for security and logistical coordination. Canada has extended invitations to other non-G7 countries, including Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, and Brazil.\n\nDiplomatic relations between India and Canada were impacted following the killing of Khalistani separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada in June 2023. The previous Canadian government under Justin Trudeau had made allegations regarding Indian government involvement, which India denied. Following a change in government, new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi exchanged messages expressing a desire to strengthen bilateral ties. However, Indian officials have stated concerns regarding the activities of Khalistani elements in Canada and expect Ottawa to guarantee the safety of Indian diplomats.\n\nSikh organizations in Canada, including the 'Sikh Federation' and the 'World Sikh Organization', have publicly demanded that the Canadian government not invite Prime Minister Modi to the G7 summit. They have cited the Indian government's alleged involvement in the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and other human rights concerns. In a letter to Prime Minister Mark Carney, the World Sikh Organization of Canada stated that inviting the Indian Prime Minister would be an 'irresponsible decision' and would signal that Canada is willing to ignore foreign interference.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "12-14 days. The G7 summit is scheduled for June 15-17, 2025, so the outcome will be definitively known by June 17, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Modi does not attend. India has not received an official invitation as of June 3, 2025, and no advance preparations for a high-level visit are underway.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Canada does not extend an invitation to India, or extends one too late for proper security and logistics planning. Given diplomatic tensions over the Nijjar affair and domestic pressure from Canadian Sikh organizations explicitly opposing Modi's attendance, PM Carney decides not to invite India or delays until it's logistically impossible for Modi to attend.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Within the next 2-3 days, Canada extends a formal invitation to India despite diplomatic tensions and domestic opposition. Modi accepts quickly, and both countries rush through security and logistics arrangements on an expedited timeline. The new Carney government prioritizes engaging India as a major geopolitical partner over domestic political concerns.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly favors a No outcome. As of June 3, with only 12-14 days until the summit, India has not received an invitation and no advance preparations are underway. High-level diplomatic visits typically require weeks of planning for security and logistics - we're now well within that critical window. Canada has invited other non-G7 countries (Australia, Ukraine, South Africa, Brazil) but notably not India, suggesting a deliberate omission. The diplomatic backdrop is unfavorable: despite positive messaging between Modi and new Canadian PM Carney, underlying tensions from the Nijjar killing allegations persist, and Indian officials have expressed ongoing concerns about Khalistani activities and diplomat safety in Canada. Significantly, Sikh organizations in Canada have publicly lobbied against inviting Modi, creating domestic political pressure on Carney. The forecast is not lower (closer to 0%) because technically there remains a narrow window for a last-minute invitation in the next 2-3 days, and the new Carney government has expressed interest in improving bilateral ties. India remains an important geopolitical player, and G7 summits occasionally have last-minute guest additions. However, the forecast is not higher because the logistical hurdles of arranging such a visit on extremely short notice, combined with unresolved political tensions and lack of any current invitation, make attendance highly improbable. An upward revision would require clear signs of an imminent invitation or advance preparations beginning within 48 hours. A downward revision would be triggered by passage of time beyond June 5-6 without action or explicit Canadian statements ruling out Modi's attendance.",
