  "information": "As of late May 2025, there have been no public reports of Databricks selecting underwriters for an IPO or of the company making a confidential S-1 filing with the SEC. Market sentiment has been described as uncertain, with some IPO advisors noting that while planning is occurring, macroeconomic concerns might cause delays. Other major tech startups, such as Stripe, have also remained private despite IPO expectations. In contrast, companies like Klarna and eToro have reportedly filed confidential IPO paperwork.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About five weeks, as the deadline is July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Databricks remains a private company and does not announce an IPO plan.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Databricks board and CEO continue to monitor the market and conclude that macroeconomic conditions remain too uncertain for a successful public debut. They decide to wait for a more stable and receptive market window, likely in late 2025 or 2026, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an S-1 filing or a public announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Driven by a sudden improvement in market sentiment in late May or early June, Databricks decides to seize the opportune window. Having already prepared and confidentially filed an S-1 with the SEC, the company makes its public announcement or the S-1 filing becomes public before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. With only about five weeks until the deadline, the absence of public signals that an IPO announcement is imminent is the most significant factor. The IPO process, including selecting underwriters and preparing the S-1 filing, is extensive. While parts can be confidential, leaks are common, and the research assistant's report notes no such information. This suggests that a public filing by July 1 is unlikely.\n\nThe broader market context supports this view. The report indicates 'uncertain' market sentiment and notes that other major tech companies like Stripe are also remaining private, suggesting the conditions are not compellingly favorable for a blockbuster IPO. Databricks' CEO has a history of caution regarding the timing of a public offering, reinforcing the idea that they would not rush into an unstable market.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 10% because Databricks is widely considered 'IPO-ready' and could have already filed confidentially. A rapid, positive shift in market conditions in the coming weeks could still trigger a quick decision to make the filing public. The company has the internal infrastructure to move swiftly if they perceive a favorable, albeit brief, market window.\n\nMy probability is not higher because the short timeframe makes the lack of preparatory signals very telling. For an announcement to happen within five weeks, activity would likely be detectable now. The 'uncertain' market conditions provide no compelling reason for the company to deviate from its current patient stance.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were credible reports of Databricks selecting underwriters or making a confidential S-1 filing. I would decrease my forecast if the CEO makes public statements reaffirming a 'wait-and-see' approach or if negative macroeconomic data further chills the IPO market.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Databricks announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nTechCrunch: ['It's dumb to IPO this year': Databricks CEO explains why he's waiting to go public](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dumb-ipo-databricks-ceo-explains-064957000.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Databricks, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) Databricks filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.databricks.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of late May 2025, there have been no public reports of Databricks selecting underwriters for an IPO or of the company making a confidential S-1 filing with the SEC. Market sentiment has been described as uncertain, with some IPO advisors noting that while planning is occurring, macroeconomic concerns might cause delays. Other major tech startups, such as Stripe, have also remained private despite IPO expectations. In contrast, companies like Klarna and eToro have reportedly filed confidential IPO paperwork.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
