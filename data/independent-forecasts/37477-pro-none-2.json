    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "23 days (from May 9, 2025, to May 31, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Given that tariffs are a central and ongoing policy focus of the current U.S. administration, the word 'tariff(s)' is expected to continue appearing regularly on the front pages of major newspapers. Under the status quo, it is highly probable that at least one of the two papers will mention the topic each day, thus preventing a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The U.S. government's focus on trade policy persists through the end of May. Ongoing negotiations with major trading partners, threats of new tariffs, or analysis of their economic impact are sufficiently newsworthy to warrant a front-page mention in either The New York Times or the Wall Street Journal every single day during the resolution period.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major breaking news event, unrelated to trade policy (e.g., a major natural disaster, a significant international military conflict, or a landmark Supreme Court decision), occurs. This event dominates the news cycle for at least one day, pushing any and all stories mentioning 'tariff(s)' off the front pages of both The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal simultaneously.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the strong status quo that tariffs are a central, high-profile policy issue for the current administration, making them a recurring topic of front-page news. The research assistant's report provided no additional information, so my analysis relies on the provided context and an understanding of media cycles. The primary factor supporting a 'No' outcome is the high likelihood that this signature policy will continue to generate daily headlines in at least one of two premier newspapers—one general (NYT) and one financial (WSJ). The bar for a 'Yes' is high, as it requires both papers to be free of the word on the same day. However, the question only requires this to happen once over a 23-day period. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is the inherent volatility of the news cycle. A 23-day window is long enough to have a non-trivial chance of a major, unrelated event (a 'news blackout' event for other topics) occurring and dominating the front pages of both papers. My forecast is not higher than 25% because the subject of tariffs is a core policy issue, not a peripheral one, and the dual-paper requirement makes a 'clean' day difficult to achieve. It is not lower because a 23-day period provides a reasonable number of opportunities for a random, large-scale news event to occur, particularly over a weekend when the news cycle for economic policy can be slower. I would increase my forecast if there were signs of a major trade deal being finalized or a pivot by the administration to a different, all-consuming policy crisis. I would decrease it if a new, major trade war escalated, which would guarantee daily coverage.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff(s)\" disappear from the front print pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal by June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's renewed love for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\n\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. When, if ever, will we seen tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve to \"Yes\" if, after \\[OPEN DATE] and before June 1, 2025, the words, \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\", do not appear on the print front page of The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. The following URLs will be used to resolve the question:\n\n* The New York Times: [https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper](https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper)\n* Wall Street Journal:\t [https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250414/frontpage](https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250414/frontpage)\n\n***\n\n<sup>Note: WSJ front page URL for April 14, 2025. Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\nGrammar is not relevant (e.g. \"TARIFF\" will suffice to prevent a \"No\" resolution).\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\n\n\"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, it does not have to be in a title.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-09.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
