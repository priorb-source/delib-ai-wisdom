    "no_outcome_scenario": "Tariffs remain a dominant economic and political story throughout the period. Given Trump's focus on trade policy and the significant economic impacts, at least one of these two major business newspapers mentions tariffs on their front page every single day through June 30, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A major breaking news event (international crisis, natural disaster, political scandal, or other dominant story) captures both newspapers' front pages for at least one day, pushing tariff coverage to inside pages. Or, tariff news temporarily quiets as negotiations stabilize or other economic stories take precedence, allowing both papers to focus elsewhere simultaneously for just one day.",
    "rationale": "The question explicitly states the criteria have not yet been satisfied, meaning from May 20-26 (6-7 days), tariffs have appeared on at least one front page every single day. This establishes a strong status quo pattern. Trump has made tariffs central to his economic policy, and both newspapers extensively cover business and trade policy. However, the resolution criteria only require ONE day out of approximately 35 remaining days where both papers omit tariffs. This is a relatively low bar. The challenge is that BOTH papers must omit it on the SAME day - if one mentions it, the question doesn't resolve Yes. The fact that it hasn't happened in the first week suggests tariffs are persistently newsworthy. Major newspapers typically coordinate coverage on the biggest stories, but smaller events or slower news days do occur. With 35 days remaining, there's reasonable probability of at least one day meeting these criteria, though the week-long status quo pattern weighs against it. I'm not higher because the established pattern is strong and tariffs are genuinely major news. I'm not lower because 35 days provides many opportunities and news cycles are inherently variable.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the word \"tariff\" disappear from the front pages of The New York Times and Wall Street Journal before July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWhether reading the newspaper or social media or watching the news, it is highly likely you are going to see something about tariffs - mainly due to US President Donald Trump's [renewed love](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20250401-tariff-man-trump-s-long-history-with-trade-wars) for this somewhat antiquated form of taxation.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times and the Wall Street Journal are two of the largest print newspapers in the US. Before July, will we see tariffs wiped from the front pages of both papers?\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on any single day after May 19, 2025 and before July 1, 2025, the words \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\" appear on neither the digital version of the front page of The New York Times nor the Wall Street Journal. The following URLs will be used to resolve the question:\r\n\r\n* The New York Times: [https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper](https://www.nytimes.com/section/todayspaper)\r\n* Wall Street Journal: [https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250515/frontpage](https://www.wsj.com/print-edition/20250515/frontpage)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<sup>Note: WSJ front page URL for May 15, 2025. Format is: yyyy-mm-dd.</sup>\n\n* Grammar or spelling will not prevent a **No** resolution.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" must be omitted from both papers' front pages on the same day.\r\n* \"Tariff(s)\" can appear anywhere on the page, including \"Pages A2-A3 and Corrections\", \"What's News: Business & Finance\" not just the initial section at the top. The only sections that do not qualify are those that do not change between different front pages such as the \"Most Popular News\" or \"Recommended Videos\" sections on WSJ.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-26.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
