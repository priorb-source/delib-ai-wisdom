    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same key hinge I identified: whether a qualifying bill cleared both chambers before sine die. New/useful emphases from them: (1) enactment can occur without the governor’s signature (true in Florida), which modestly boosts the conditional probability given passage; (2) the possibility of folding provisions into an omnibus/“train” at the end of session; and (3) an explicit two-state blend (passed vs. didn’t pass) with high/low conditional probabilities. I agree with their legal-risk caution (NVRA) and the Florida Senate’s tendency to moderate litigation-prone provisions. Where I differ is on the prior that a documentary proof mandate actually cleared both chambers in the final days—given timing, legal risk, and Florida’s history of preferring backend verification, I think that probability is a bit lower than their implicit assumption. Still, the omnibus point warrants a slight upward nudge from my prior.",
    "rationale": "Time left: ~8 weeks until July 1. Session status: The 2025 regular session almost certainly adjourned around May 2. If a qualifying bill passed, enactment before July 1 is very likely (signature or becoming law without signature). If it did not pass, a special session focused on this by July 1 is possible but unlikely. What counts: The measure must require voters to provide proof of citizenship beyond current requirements; backend/database checks alone would not resolve Yes. Politics: GOP trifecta and gubernatorial support create a nontrivial chance something moved late, potentially via an omnibus. Constraints: NVRA preemption risk and administrative complexity (e.g., dual systems) make a documentary proof mandate more legally exposed than backend verification, making Senate passage less likely in a compressed window. Blend: I model two states—(a) it passed (conditional enactment ≈ 90–95%), (b) it didn’t (chance by special session ≈ 5–10%). My subjective probability that such a mandate cleared both chambers is modest, given timing and legal risk. Incorporating the other forecasters’ omnibus/trains argument, I raise that slightly versus my prior. Net: small increase from 30% to 32%.",
