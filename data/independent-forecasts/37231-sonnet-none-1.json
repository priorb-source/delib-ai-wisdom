    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Within 1-2 weeks. Today is April 29, 2025, and April unemployment data is typically published by mid-May.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - based on historical patterns, Mexico's unemployment rate has frequently been below 3%",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "US tariffs on Mexican auto exports have already begun impacting employment in the manufacturing sector, pushing overall unemployment to 3.0% or higher. Economic uncertainty causes broader hiring freezes across industries.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mexico's labor market remains tight despite tariff concerns. The unemployment rate stays in its historical range of 2.5-2.9%, as employment effects from recent tariff announcements have not yet fully materialized in April data. Mexico's diversified economy and strong domestic demand maintain low unemployment.",
    "rationale": "Mexico has historically maintained relatively low unemployment rates, frequently in the 2.5-3.5% range, with periods below 3% being common. The status quo baseline suggests unemployment would likely be near or below 3%. The article mentions US tariffs affecting auto supply chains, which is a genuine concern. However, several factors moderate this risk: (1) Employment effects from tariffs typically lag their implementation by several months as companies adjust inventories and production before layoffs, (2) April data captures conditions through the month, meaning very recent policy changes may not be fully reflected, (3) Mexico's economy is diversified beyond autos. The main risk is if tariff impacts materialized faster than typical or if there were already deteriorating conditions before the tariffs. Without specific recent data from my research assistant on Mexico's unemployment trajectory in early 2025, I must rely on historical baselines while accounting for new downside risks. My forecast is not higher because the tariff situation represents real economic headwinds that could push unemployment above 3%. It's not lower because historical patterns show Mexico frequently maintains sub-3% unemployment, and employment data tends to be a lagging indicator. I would update higher with evidence that Mexico's unemployment was trending well below 3% in Q1 2025, or lower with evidence of significant manufacturing job losses already occurring.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mexico's unemployment rate be under 3% in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [US tariffs ripple through auto supply chains into Mexico](https://apnews.com/article/mexico-stellantis-trump-tariffs-sheinbaum-569ae29d203b1997d50a3a9655c928a8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mexico's unemployment rate is less than 3.0% for April 2025 according to data presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/mexico/unemployment-rate).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
