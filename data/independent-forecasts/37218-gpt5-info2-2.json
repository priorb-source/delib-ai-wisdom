  "information": "UFC 315 is scheduled for May 10, 2025, at the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The event's fight card includes two title fights, with a welterweight championship bout between Belal Muhammad and Jack Della Maddalena as one of the main events. No sitting or former U.S. president has previously attended a UFC event held in Canada or any other foreign country.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 12 days (event date May 10, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — he does not travel to Montreal and is not present anywhere on Bell Centre grounds",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Trump remains in the U.S. that weekend, attends to presidential duties or other events, and does not make an international trip to a Canadian UFC card.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump pairs a brief Montreal stop with an official visit or donor/political meetings in Canada and makes a short appearance (cageside or backstage) at the Bell Centre during UFC 315.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/context: UFC 315 is slated for May 10, 2025 at the Bell Centre in Montreal. The assistant notes that no sitting or former U.S. president has attended a UFC event outside the U.S. This creates a very low base rate for a foreign UFC attendance by a president.\n- Trump’s UFC attendance pattern: He frequently attends high-profile UFC events in the U.S., especially when it suits his schedule and optics, and he has a close relationship with Dana White. That raises the general propensity but mainly for domestic cards.\n- Frictions specific to this event: International travel by a sitting president for a leisure appearance entails substantial security and diplomatic coordination (Secret Service/RCMP, logistics, cost, optics). Canada’s entry rules for individuals with criminal history can add process friction, though heads of state can be accommodated via diplomatic channels on official travel; a purely private visit still adds complexity and scrutiny.\n- Timing: With less than two weeks to go, such a visit would typically be planned and likely signaled in advance if tied to official business. The lack of a clear, announced Canadian trip for that weekend (which would usually be on calendars or credibly reported) keeps the status quo as non-attendance.\n- Why not higher: Foreign venue (Canada), presidential travel constraints, lack of precedent, and minimal political upside compared to domestic UFC events keep the probability low.\n- Why not lower: Trump has a demonstrated affinity for UFC optics, Dana White could facilitate, Montreal is a short flight from the U.S. Northeast, and a stop could be tacked onto an official or quasi-official visit if one materializes.\n- What would move the forecast up: Credible reporting or official schedule indicating Trump will be in Canada that weekend (especially Montreal), UFC/Dana White teasing or confirming his attendance, or any announced bilateral/meeting in Montreal proximate to May 10.\n- What would move it down: Announced conflicting engagements in the U.S., indications he will remain in Washington that weekend, or any security/diplomatic development limiting discretionary foreign travel then.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
