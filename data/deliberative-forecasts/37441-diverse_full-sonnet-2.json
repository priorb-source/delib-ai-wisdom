    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I converged independently on 18%, emphasizing similar factors: the large 9.5% move required in under 2 months, limited Fed easing probability, existing dollar weakness, and trade policy risks. However, Forecaster 3's analysis at 7% raises several compelling points I underweighted:\n\n1. **ECB policy dynamics**: Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes that the ECB is widely expected to cut in June, which is typically EUR-negative. If the ECB cuts while the Fed holds (63-67% probability), this narrows rate differentials in favor of the USD, working against the Yes outcome. I didn't properly account for this key factor.\n\n2. **Base rate/volatility framework**: The statistical reasoning that a 10% move in 7 weeks represents a tail event in G10 FX is more rigorous than my approach. Without crisis-level catalysts, such moves are rare.\n\n3. **Safe haven dynamics**: The observation that geopolitical stress/tariffs often boost USD as a safe haven is important. My framing of trade tensions as purely USD-negative was too simplistic.\n\n4. **Technical magnitude**: Moving from the current 1.13-1.15 range to 1.25 requires breaking multiple resistance levels and significant acceleration, not just trend continuation.\n\nHowever, I find Forecaster 3's 7% slightly too low given: (a) the dollar's existing 7% YTD decline showing real momentum, (b) the 3-year low status quo, (c) the question only requiring touching 0.80 once, not sustaining it, and (d) some technical analysts do target 1.25, even if timing is uncertain.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast downward. The ECB cutting in June while the Fed likely holds is a crucial EUR-negative factor I underweighted. Combined with the low base rate for 10% G10 FX moves in 7 weeks and the ambiguous directionality of trade tensions on USD (safe haven effects), my initial 18% was too high. However, the existing 7% YTD dollar weakness, 3-year low status, and the single-touch nature of the threshold (vs. sustained level) keep me above Forecaster 3's 7%. The modal outcome remains No - continued range trading around 1.12-1.15 - but tail risk from potential US data deterioration, Fed pivot signals, or major EU fiscal surprises warrants a non-trivial probability. I'm settling on 11%, reflecting that this is a low-probability tail event that requires abnormal volatility or specific shocks, while acknowledging the existing momentum makes it slightly more plausible than pure base rates would suggest.",
