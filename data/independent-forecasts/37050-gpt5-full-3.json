  "information": "Historical changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are infrequent. In February 2024, Intel and Walgreens were replaced. In August 2020, Exxon Mobil, Pfizer, and Raytheon Technologies were replaced by Salesforce, Amgen, and Honeywell. In June 2018, General Electric was replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance, and in March 2015, AT&T was replaced by Apple.\n\nSeveral DJIA components have experienced recent negative performance and events. UnitedHealth Group's stock dropped 22%, causing a record 805-point single-stock decline in the DJIA. In March 2025, Nike's stock dropped 20.1%, Walt Disney's fell 13.3%, and Nvidia's declined 13.2%. IBM shares fell 7.6% after the company announced the cancellation of 15 government contracts. IBM (-6.6%) and Procter & Gamble (-3.7%) have also experienced recent losses.\n\nThe broader US stock market is experiencing significant volatility driven by corporate earnings, trade policy uncertainty, and economic indicators. President Trump's tariffs sparked a 2,200-point drop in the DJIA on April 4, 2025. In response to the impact of tariffs, Deutsche Bank strategists cut their year-end S&P 500 target by 12%. The Federal Reserve is described as cautious due to persistent inflation.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 67 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No change: all listed companies remain in the DJIA through July 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The S&P Dow Jones Indices committee makes no changes over the next two months. Despite volatility (e.g., UNH, Nike, Disney, Nvidia moves), there’s no major corporate action (spin-off, merger, bankruptcy risk) or representation gap that compels a swap, so names like Boeing, 3M, IBM, or Verizon stay in.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An S&P Dow Jones Indices announcement before July 1 removes at least one current component—e.g., dropping Boeing, 3M, IBM, or Verizon to add a company like Alphabet or Meta for industry representation; or a corporate event (large spin-off, merger, or severe operational/regulatory crisis) forces a change. Any such announcement, regardless of effective date, resolves Yes.",
    "rationale": "Base rates dominate. DJIA changes are infrequent and typically tied to structural representation needs or major corporate events. Over the last two decades, changes occurred roughly every 2–4 years (2015, 2018, 2020, 2024), sometimes in small clusters but not usually within months of a prior change. The most recent reshuffle was as recently as Feb 2024 (Intel and Walgreens removed), which lowers near-term odds of another change. On a base-rate basis, a two-month window implies a single-digit chance of a change. Recent volatility and drawdowns noted by the research assistant (large moves in UNH, Nike, Disney, Nvidia; IBM contract issues; broader market turbulence) are not, by themselves, typical catalysts for Dow changes. The committee tends to act for sector representation or when corporate actions materially alter a company’s role. Reasons the probability isn’t higher: lack of a clear, imminent trigger; recent 2024 changes may have already addressed representation (adding Nvidia and Amazon). Reasons it isn’t lower: there are plausible weak links and potential strategic adds (e.g., replacing Verizon, IBM, 3M, or Boeing to introduce Alphabet or Meta), and unforeseen corporate actions (spin-offs, mergers, severe regulatory/operational crises, or price-weighted distortions from splits) can prompt quick changes. I would update upward on credible reporting of the index committee evaluating changes, any major corporate event among current components (e.g., Boeing facing escalated regulatory shutdowns, a large spin-off, or a merger), or hints the committee wants to add a major name for representation. I’d update downward if volatility subsides and no such corporate or committee signals emerge by mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any of these companies get dropped from the Dow Jones Industrial Average before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nOregon Business: [Intel Ousted From Dow Jones By Rival Nvidia](https://oregonbusiness.com/intel-ousted-from-dow-jones-by-rival-nvidia/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, there is any official announcement or confirmation (or credible source reporting) that any of the following companies will no longer be a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) either on the official announcement or that the company has been or will be removed from the index: Amazon.com Inc, American Express Co, Amgen Inc, Apple Inc, Boeing Co, Caterpillar Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, Chevron Corp, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Home Depot Inc, Honeywell International Inc, International Business Machines Corp, Johnson & Johnson, Coca-Cola Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, McDonald’s Corp, 3M Co, Merck & Co Inc, Microsoft Corp, Nike Inc, Procter & Gamble Co, Sherwin-Williams Co, Travelers Companies Inc, Unitedhealth Group Inc, Salesforce Inc, NVIDIA Corp, Verizon Communications Inc, Visa Inc, Walmart Inc, Walt Disney Co.\n\nAlthough removals from the index are generally effective immediately in order to forestall frontrunning, this is not a requirement for this question. All that is required is for there to be an announcement or confirmation before the resolution date about the removal from the DJIA at any point in time. Therefore this question will resolve based on the announcement or confirmation, not on the actual removal date.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nHistorical changes to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) are infrequent.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
