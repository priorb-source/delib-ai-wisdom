    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 48 days remain until July 1, 2025. There is likely at least one FOMC meeting scheduled in mid-to-late June before the resolution date.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the Federal Reserve maintains its current interest rate policy through July 1, 2025 without announcing any rate cuts",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Fed continues to hold rates steady through July 1st. Inflation remains above target or economic data stays strong enough to justify maintaining current rates. The FOMC's June meeting (if scheduled) results in no change to the target federal funds rate, with Fed officials signaling they need more time to assess economic conditions before considering rate cuts.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Economic conditions deteriorate significantly in the coming weeks - perhaps through weaker-than-expected jobs reports, sharp declines in consumer spending, financial market stress, or inflation falling well below the Fed's 2% target. These developments prompt the FOMC to announce a rate cut at their next meeting (likely in June) to provide economic support.",
    "rationale": "The recent pause in rate cuts is a strong signal that the Fed is not currently in cutting mode, which heavily favors the status quo. The fact that JP Morgan notes the Fed decided to 'pause rate cuts' suggests they had been cutting previously but have now stopped, indicating concern about either inflation persistence or economic resilience that doesn't warrant further cuts. With approximately 7 weeks until resolution, there is likely one FOMC meeting in mid-to-late June. For the Fed to reverse course and cut rates so soon after pausing would require a significant deterioration in economic conditions or a sharp unexpected decline in inflation. The Fed typically moves deliberately and signals policy changes well in advance. Good forecasters weight the status quo heavily, and here the status quo strongly suggests no cut. However, the probability is not negligible because: (1) there is meaningful time remaining with at least one meeting likely, (2) economic conditions can shift, particularly given ongoing uncertainties in 2025, and (3) the Fed has shown willingness to act decisively when conditions warrant. My forecast is not higher because the recent pause is a strong contra-indicator, and absent specific evidence of deteriorating conditions, the burden of proof for a rate cut is high. My forecast is not lower because nearly 7 weeks provides sufficient time for conditions to change and for the Fed to respond, and we lack detailed current economic data that might show emerging weakness. I would update higher with evidence of: significant economic weakening, sharp inflation drops, or financial instability. I would update lower with: continued strong growth data, persistent above-target inflation, or explicit Fed guidance against near-term cuts.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Federal Reserve cut interest rates before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nJP Morgan: [Following the Fed’s decision to pause rate cuts, what could its next move be?](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025 the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announces a reduction of any amount in the target federal funds rate range.\r\nThe primary resolution source is the FOMC's *target federal funds rate or range* webpage [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm), the Federal Reserve's official minutes and statements [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm), or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the Federal Reserve's website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\nThis question resolves based on the announcement. Therefore, the effective date of the rate cut does not need to be before the resolution date, as long as the announcement is made before then.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
