  "information": "According to data from Drought.gov on May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents, representing 73.9% of the state's population, were in drought-affected areas. Reports from late April 2025 indicated that 84% of the state was classified under moderate to extreme drought conditions, a severity level not seen since April 2012. The state has recorded its 12th driest April-to-March period since 1895, and some regions are 6-10 inches below their average rainfall since mid-October 2024.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "30 days from today (May 29, 2025) until the resolution date of June 28, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES - Currently 14.5 million Florida residents are living in drought-affected areas as of May 29, 2025, which is above the 14.0 million threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Significant rainfall from early wet season onset or tropical weather systems brings substantial precipitation to Florida in June, reducing drought severity enough that the affected population drops below 14.0 million residents by June 28",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Drought conditions persist at current levels or worsen over the next 30 days, keeping at least 14.0 million residents in drought-affected areas. This could occur if the wet season starts slowly or if rainfall is insufficient to meaningfully reduce the substantial rainfall deficit",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a YES outcome. Currently, 14.5 million Florida residents (73.9% of the population) are in drought conditions, providing a buffer of 0.5 million residents above the threshold. The research assistant's report indicates severe conditions: 84% of the state is under moderate to extreme drought (worst since 2012), the state experienced its 12th driest April-to-March period since 1895, and some regions are 6-10 inches below average rainfall since mid-October 2024. \n\nThe key question is whether conditions can improve enough in just 30 days to drop below the threshold. While June marks the beginning of Florida's wet season (typically May/June through October), several factors suggest drought persistence is more likely: (1) Drought conditions built over 7-8 months and typically require sustained rainfall over weeks or months to resolve; (2) Drought Monitor classifications are updated weekly but tend to be 'sticky,' changing gradually unless exceptional rainfall occurs; (3) Even with wet season rainfall, soil moisture recovery, aquifer recharge, and classification updates lag behind precipitation events; (4) The deep rainfall deficit requires substantial precipitation to overcome.\n\nThe main uncertainty is whether Florida experiences exceptional June rainfall from tropical systems or an aggressive wet season onset. However, even early wet season rainfall doesn't guarantee immediate drought designation changes. The small buffer (2.5% of population) does create some vulnerability if conditions improve moderately.\n\nMy forecast is not higher (toward 90%+) because: the wet season is beginning, creating real possibility of significant rainfall; the buffer is relatively small; and one month allows for 4-5 drought monitor updates. My forecast is not lower (toward 50-60%) because: drought conditions are severe and well-established; 30 days is short for meaningful drought recovery; and status quo persistence is the baseline expectation. I would update higher with evidence of continued dry conditions or delayed wet season, and lower with forecasts of major tropical systems or exceptional early rainfall.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have 14.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nUSA Today: [14 million Florida residents are under drought conditions, some extreme: What to know](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/04/28/florida-drought-conditions-what-to-know/83328368007/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/florida) lists greater than or equal to 14.0 million Florida residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to data from Drought.gov on May 29, 2025, 14.5 million Florida residents, representing 73.9% of the state's population, were in drought-affected areas.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
