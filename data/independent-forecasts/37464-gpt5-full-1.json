  "information": "LPK1, a Renton, Washington establishment, is recalling approximately 303 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken Caesar wrap products. The recall was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, as the Caesar dressing packet contains fish (anchovies) which is not declared on the product label. The recall is designated as Class II. The affected products were produced on February 15, 17, and 19, 2025. The corresponding 'best by' dates were February 21, 23, and 25, 2025, and the lot codes were LPK1WA046, LPK1WA048, and LPK1WA050.\n\nThe recalled chicken Caesar wraps were distributed to vending machines located in office buildings within the state of Washington. The labeling issue was discovered by the company during a routine quality assurance check of ingredient labels. As of early May 2025, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions or illnesses due to the consumption of these products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has urged consumers and offices not to consume or serve the products and to either return them or dispose of them.\n\nThe recall was issued on February 24, 2025. According to the FSIS recall webpage, the status of the recall remained 'Active' as of May 8, 2025. The general FSIS process for closing a recall requires verification that all affected product has been accounted for and removed from commerce, and confirmation that the company has implemented appropriate corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 23 days (through May 31, 2025, since it must close before June 1).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS keeps the recall status at Active through May 31 because final verification paperwork or corrective-action documentation isn’t completed or processed in time, even though product is long expired and out of commerce.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "LPK1 provides satisfactory documentation that all affected wraps are accounted for/removed and that label corrections are implemented; FSIS completes verification and updates the recall page to Closed in late May.",
    "rationale": "- What we know: The recall is small (≈303 lbs), Class II, limited to Washington vending machines. The implicated lots had best-by dates in late February. As of May 8, the FSIS page still shows Active. No illnesses reported. FSIS typically closes recalls once product disposition is verified and corrective actions are confirmed.\n- Base rates/timing: For small, limited-distribution, undeclared-allergen recalls, closures often occur within a few months. From Feb 24 to June 1 is ~3 months. That’s a plausible window, but not guaranteed; many FSIS recalls remain Active for several months due to verification and administrative lag.\n- Status quo weighting: With only ~23 days left and the status currently Active, inertia slightly favors No unless FSIS finalizes its closeout soon. Class II urgency and small firm paperwork could slow closure.\n- Why not higher: As of May 8 it’s still Active; only a short window remains. FSIS processing and documentation requirements can push closures past arbitrary dates.\n- Why not lower: Very limited scope, perishable product long out of commerce, and a straightforward corrective action (fixing labeling for Caesar dressing/anchovies) all support a decent chance of timely closure within May.\n- What would move me up: Evidence that LPK1 has completed corrective actions and FSIS has performed/accepted verification; other similar 2025 small allergen recalls closing in ~70–95 days; any FSIS update cadence suggesting imminent closure.\n- What would move me down: Continued Active status into the last week of May; signals of lingering verification issues or broader distribution than initially stated.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nLPK1, a Renton, Washington establishment, is recalling approximately 303 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken Caesar wrap products.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
