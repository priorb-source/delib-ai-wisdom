    "review": "Forecaster 3 added concrete, time-relevant information I hadn’t explicitly cited: the Verkhovna Rada’s May 15 extension of martial law to August 6, 2025. That materially reinforces the status quo and further compresses the window for any credible move toward an announcement. They also emphasized the need for an authorized body (likely the Rada) to set the date and the practical 90-day election process constraint, which makes a near-term announcement even less likely. I find this reasoning persuasive.\n\nForecaster 2 argues the bar is low because the question is about an announcement, not holding the election, and cites political incentives and elite discussion reports. I think this overestimates how “cheap” an announcement is. In Ukraine, setting the presidential election date is a parliamentary act, not merely a presidential press statement. Announcing a specific date would require the competent authority and create binding expectations amid martial law, likely necessitating legal changes or a credible plan to lift martial law. With the President’s Office denying active planning and martial law just extended beyond July 1, such a move looks unlikely. I don’t find 35% consistent with the institutional and legal constraints or the fresh extension.\n\nNet: Forecaster 3’s points nudge me down modestly from my prior; Forecaster 2 doesn’t shift me upward.",
    "rationale": "Time left is ~46 days. Under martial law, nationwide elections are suspended, and the parliament—likely the only authority that can set a specific election date—has just extended martial law to August 6, 2025. The President’s Office recently denied reports of planning a July 2025 election. Western partners have largely accepted election postponement under wartime conditions. An announcement that meets the resolution criteria likely requires a formal parliamentary act specifying a date (not merely a vague roadmap or conditional intent). Doing that now would carry legal and political costs and would imply a credible plan to lift martial law on a timetable, which current security dynamics do not support.\n\nA Yes path exists but is tail: a sudden breakthrough (peace/ceasefire), an extraordinary political bargain, or a deliberate decision by the Rada to set a future date as a legitimacy signal. I’d update meaningfully upward only on concrete signs: draft Rada resolutions to set a date, senior leadership signaling intent to legislate wartime election mechanisms, or credible movement toward lifting martial law. Absent that, and with the fresh extension, No remains overwhelmingly likely.\n\nCompared to my prior 7%, I’m lowering slightly to reflect the new extension beyond the resolution date and the need for an authorized act specifying a date.",
