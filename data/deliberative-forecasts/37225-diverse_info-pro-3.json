    "review": "My initial forecast of 72% was based on structural factors like the Progressive Reform Party's (VHP) incumbency and the apparent fragmentation of the opposition, particularly the National Democratic Party (NDP) after its leader's death. I was operating without crucial quantitative data on public sentiment, which the other two forecasters provided.\n\nForecaster 2 introduced specific polling data, which was extremely valuable. The data showed a huge swing from a large NDP lead in January to a narrow VHP lead in April. This highlights extreme volatility and tells me my initial high confidence was completely unwarranted. This evidence alone would have caused me to significantly lower my forecast towards the 50-60% range.\n\nHowever, Forecaster 3's analysis was the most impactful. They introduced fundamental data on public sentiment that I had entirely missed: President Santokhi's catastrophic ~3% approval rating and the fact that 66% of the population feels the country is worse off. These are not lagging indicators; they are powerful, direct measures of the electorate's mood shortly before an election. An approval rating this low is an almost insurmountable obstacle for an incumbent. It suggests a deep-seated desire for change that outweighs incumbency advantages and even positive macroeconomic data like falling inflation. Forecaster 3's reasoning that such extreme negative sentiment is the primary driver of the outcome is highly convincing.",
    "rationale": "I am making a significant downward revision to my forecast, from 72% to 30%. This 42-point change is driven almost entirely by the new evidence introduced by my fellow forecasters, particularly Forecaster 3.\n\nThe core of my updated rationale is that President Santokhi's ~3% approval rating is the single most important variable. This indicator suggests a level of public hostility that makes a plurality win for his VHP party highly improbable. While positive economic news exists, the public sentiment data clearly shows it has not translated into political support.\n\nMy new forecast of 30% is higher than Forecaster 3's 18% because I still place significant weight on the structural factor of opposition fragmentation, which was part of my original analysis. In a multi-party system with a new, untested national proportional representation system, the threshold for winning a plurality could be very low. It is plausible that deep dissatisfaction with the VHP does not coalesce behind a single opposition party but instead splinters among the NDP, ABOP, NPS, and other smaller alliances. In such a scenario, the VHP could potentially win a plurality with a historically low percentage of the vote (e.g., 25%) simply by retaining its core base while no other single party manages to consolidate the anti-incumbent vote effectively. This path to a VHP win is narrow, but it makes the outcome more uncertain than an 18% forecast would suggest. Nonetheless, the overwhelming public dissatisfaction makes a VHP loss the most likely outcome.",
