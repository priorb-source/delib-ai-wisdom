  "information": "According to the resolution source, drought.gov, approximately 22.7 million California residents were living in areas of drought (classified as D1-D4) as of the week of May 27, 2025. The U.S. Drought Monitor map, which provides this data, is updated weekly. Earlier in the year, on March 25, 2025, the California Department of Water Resources reported that water storage at Lake Oroville was 86% full and the statewide snowpack was at 96% of the normal level for that date. Consequently, the State Water Project increased its water allocation forecast to 40% of requested supplies.\n\nIn late May 2025, the National Weather Service issued extreme heat watches and advisories for several inland regions of California, with temperatures forecasted to exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center also forecasted higher-than-usual temperatures across much of the state for the summer of 2025. NOAA's outlook indicated that the ongoing drought would likely persist through the end of August, with an above-normal risk for significant wildfires from June through August.\n\nA late May 2025 weather forecast for the Bay Area noted a period of unusual weather activity, including a forecasted hot weather event followed by a sharp cooldown. The same forecast mentioned the potential formation of Tropical Storm Alvin in the Eastern Pacific. According to the report, this storm system could track northwest towards California and interact with a low-pressure system, potentially bringing widespread storm activity and rainfall. This was to be followed by a trough of low pressure from Canada, resulting in below-average temperatures and showers.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "30 days (from May 29, 2025 to June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Currently 22.7 million California residents are in drought areas, which is 2.7 million above the 20.0 million threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Significant unexpected rainfall from tropical systems or unusual storm patterns brings substantial precipitation to California, coupled with cooler-than-forecast temperatures, leading to rapid improvement in drought conditions sufficient to drop below 20.0 million residents in affected areas within 30 days",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Drought conditions persist or worsen as forecasted, with extreme heat in late May and summer continuing to stress water resources. The current 22.7 million figure holds steady or increases slightly, staying above the 20.0 million threshold through June 28",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome. Currently, 22.7 million residents are in drought areas, providing a 13.5% buffer above the 20.0 million threshold. Several factors support this continuing: (1) Timing - we're entering California's dry season (June-September), not the wet season (November-March), making significant drought improvement unlikely; (2) Official forecasts - NOAA explicitly predicts drought persisting through August with above-normal temperatures and elevated wildfire risk; (3) Current conditions - extreme heat watches issued for late May with temperatures exceeding 100°F; (4) Slow-changing nature of drought - dramatic improvements typically require sustained precipitation over weeks or months. While the research mentions potential relief from Tropical Storm Alvin and a Canadian trough bringing rainfall and cooler temperatures, these remain uncertain forecasts and would need to be substantial to reverse drought categorization for millions of residents in just 30 days. The positive water storage indicators (Lake Oroville at 86%, snowpack at 96%) reflect earlier wet season success but don't necessarily translate to rapid drought improvement during the dry season. My forecast is not higher (95%+) because weather systems like tropical storms introduce genuine uncertainty, and unexpected weather patterns do occasionally occur. It's not lower (70-80%) because the combination of: current status significantly above threshold, seasonal dry patterns, official drought persistence forecasts, and the short 30-day timeframe all strongly favor the Yes outcome. I would revise upward if subsequent drought monitor updates show the number increasing or holding steady in early June, or if weather forecasts eliminate the possibility of significant precipitation. I would revise downward only if substantial rainfall actually materializes and drought monitor data shows rapid improvement in early June",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill California have 20.0 million or more residents living in drought on June 28, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSF Gate: [California's drought has returned — and it's already bad](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/california-drought-problem-20271547.php)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Drought Monitor at [this link](https://www.drought.gov/states/california) lists greater than or equal to 20.0 million California residents in areas of drought, when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after June 28, 2025. If the number is below that, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up until the end of the tournament's scoring at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the resolution source, drought.gov, approximately 22.7 million California residents were living in areas of drought (classified as D1-D4) as of the week of May 27, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
