    "review": "The other forecasters raise several important points I didn't fully weight in my initial analysis. Forecaster 2's emphasis on language barriers and preference for local reporting mechanisms is particularly relevant - pilots in African countries may be more likely to report through national aviation authorities or local channels rather than a US-based website. Forecaster 3's point about Africa's lower commercial aviation density compared to North America and Europe is also well-taken. Both forecasters converged on 18-20%, notably lower than my 25%. Their reasoning about the cumulative effect of multiple restrictive filters (African location AND pilot AND June AND NUFORC specifically) is sound. However, I note that all three of us are working with the same limited information - one existence proof from January 2025 and no historical base rate data. The key tension is balancing the existence proof (showing it can happen) against the multiple constraints (showing it's rare).",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating slightly downward but not all the way to their range. The language barrier and local reporting preference arguments are compelling - African pilots likely have alternative reporting channels through national aviation authorities or regional organizations, reducing NUFORC reports. The lower aviation density point is also valid. However, I maintain that: (1) Africa's 54 countries provide substantial geographic scope, (2) we only need ONE qualifying report in 30 days, (3) the Rwanda example demonstrates feasibility and suggests pilots do know about NUFORC, (4) modern international pilots are well-connected. My original estimate of 2-6 such reports per year may have been optimistic; adjusting to perhaps 1-4 per year would suggest 8-33% for any given month. Splitting the difference between my original reasoning and the other forecasters' valid concerns, I'm settling on 22% - acknowledging the reporting barriers while maintaining that the combination of geographic scope, time window, and existence proof keeps the probability above the 18-20% range.",
