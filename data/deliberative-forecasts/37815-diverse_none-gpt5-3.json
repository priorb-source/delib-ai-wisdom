    "review": "Forecaster 2 adds concrete base-rate-style evidence: they claim only one South American pilot report on NUFORC in the last 12 months (Argentina, June 2024). If correct, that supports a low monthly probability near 8%. However, the background cites a Brazil December 2024 example from the NUFORC pilot index link; if that was indeed a pilot report, it would contradict F2’s “only one” finding. Because I can’t verify the database now, I treat F2’s count as plausible but uncertain. Their logic—US-centric reporting, rarity of pilot-tagged cases—matches my priors. Forecaster 3’s 35% rests on an unsupported assumption that such reports occur every 2–4 months; absent data, that seems too high for a single-month, single-region event requiring the specific NUFORC pilot index classification. I find F2’s reasoning more convincing than F3’s, though the possible inconsistency with the Brazil Dec 2024 example tempers how much weight I give F2’s exact count.",
    "rationale": "My initial 15% was based on a rough 1–2 per year cadence for South American pilot reports to NUFORC, a Poisson-like monthly probability of ~8–16%, and a small penalty for classification/timing. Forecaster 2’s account nudges the base rate toward the lower end (≈1/year), while the background example suggests at least that the pipeline exists and could be closer to 1–2/year. Given the uncertainty over whether the December 2024 Brazil entry was in the pilot index, I’ll split the difference: treat the base rate as 1–1.5/year, which implies ~8–12.5% per month. Accounting for potential posting/classification frictions (must appear on NUFORC’s pilot page for June and be visible when Metaculus checks after July 1), I position slightly above the lower bound but below my prior. Thus I trim my forecast modestly from 15% to 12%. I would update higher if we confirm two South American pilot postings in the last year or see NUFORC increasing international pilot entries; lower if we confirm only one such posting in the last year and/or observe slow posting lags into late summer.",
