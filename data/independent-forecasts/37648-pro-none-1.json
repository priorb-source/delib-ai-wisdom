    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (resolves on July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No new nuclear deal is announced. The US and Iran continue their current state of indirect communication and mutual containment, with US sanctions remaining in place and Iran's nuclear program advancing.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations, if occurring, falter due to entrenched disagreements over the extent of US sanctions relief versus the scope of Iranian nuclear concessions. Domestic political opposition in both countries, particularly from hardliners, prevents leaders from making the necessary compromises within the short timeframe.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Intensive, discreet negotiations, likely mediated by a third party like Oman, culminate in the announcement of a limited, informal agreement. This 'less-for-less' deal would see Iran cap its uranium enrichment at 60% and increase cooperation with the IAEA in exchange for the US unfreezing specific Iranian assets or providing waivers for oil sales.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on balancing the strong inertia of the status quo against the significant, specific intelligence outlined in the provided background. The default forecast for such a complex diplomatic agreement on a short timeline is 'No'. The deep-seated mistrust, domestic political constraints in both Washington and Tehran, and the complexity of the technical issues are formidable obstacles. However, the Israeli media report, citing that senior ministers were briefed on a 'high chance' of a deal, is a powerful piece of evidence that cannot be dismissed. Israel has strong intelligence capabilities and a vested interest in the outcome, so such a briefing implies that negotiations are very advanced and have overcome major hurdles. The most plausible path to a 'Yes' outcome is not a full JCPOA-style treaty, but a more limited, de-escalatory agreement, which is more achievable in under two months. My probability is not higher because last-minute diplomatic collapses are common, and the report could be a calculated leak intended to sabotage the talks. My probability is not lower because the specific intelligence from a credible source like Israel's security establishment provides a strong signal that the chances of a deal are substantially higher than the baseline. I would increase my forecast if US or Iranian officials publicly confirmed the 'final stages' of talks. I would decrease it if either side issued strong denials or if major regional escalations occurred.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States and Iran announce a new nuclear deal before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nIsraeli media (Hebrew): [Senior ministers were informed: There is a high chance that the US and Iran will reach an agreement](https://www.kan.org.il/content/kan-news/politic/895178/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the US and Iran sign or announce an agreement with respect to Iran's nuclear program.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
