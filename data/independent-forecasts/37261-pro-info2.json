  "information": "On April 5, 2025, demonstrations under the \"Hands Off!\" campaign occurred across all 50 U.S. states and in several international cities. A coalition of over 150 groups, including Indivisible and MoveOn, organized the events in response to administration policies such as federal layoffs, rising tariffs, and civil rights rollbacks. Participation estimates varied: one report cited over 1,400 events with nearly 600,000 attendees, while another stated over 600,000 people participated in more than 1,200 rallies. Solidarity protests were also held in cities like Berlin, London, and Paris.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately two months, with the outcome to be determined by July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. A protest event that almost certainly meets the size and date criteria has already occurred on April 5, 2025. The status quo is that the Global Protest Tracker will perform its stated function and report on this significant event within the remaining timeframe, consistent with its past coverage of major U.S. protests.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Global Protest Tracker experiences a significant reporting delay of over three months, or its editors decide the April 5th protests do not meet their specific criteria for a 'significant antigovernment protest'. Concurrently, no other qualifying protests emerge before the July 1 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Before July 1, 2025, the Global Protest Tracker is updated to include the nationwide 'Hands Off!' protests of April 5, 2025, confirming that at least one of the constituent rallies in a U.S. city had 10,000 or more participants.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based heavily on the research assistant's report, which indicates a qualifying event has already taken place. The 'Hands Off!' campaign on April 5, 2025, reportedly mobilized over 600,000 people nationwide. With such a large overall turnout across more than a thousand events, it is statistically very likely that at least one protest in a major city surpassed the 10,000-participant threshold. The protest's focus on administration policies aligns directly with the Global Protest Tracker's (GPT) mission to track 'significant antigovernment protests'. The primary remaining variable is not whether an event occurred, but whether the GPT will report it before the July 1, 2025 deadline. The tracker is updated on a 'rolling basis', and a nearly three-month window (from early April to July 1) is a reasonable and probable timeframe for such an update to occur. My confidence is not 100% because the resolution is contingent on the administrative action of a third party, and there remains a small possibility of a significant reporting lag, a change in the tracker's methodology, or an editorial decision that the event does not qualify for inclusion. The forecast would decrease if the tracker's website showed signs of being dormant or if information surfaced suggesting the protest's scale was overestimated. Conversely, it would increase if the tracker has a documented history of updating within a two-month timeframe after major events.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in the United States with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nBrookings Institution: [The power of protest in the US](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-power-of-protest-in-the-us/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in the United States with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn April 5, 2025, demonstrations under the \"Hands Off!\" campaign occurred across all 50 U.S. states and in several international cities.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
