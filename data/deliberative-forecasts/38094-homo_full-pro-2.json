    "review": "My initial forecast was 20%, while both of my colleagues forecasted 15%. All three of us identified the same core tension: the immense power of the status quo and the high political cost of a senator resigning or switching parties, versus a unique and severe set of destabilizing factors. These factors include Senator Fetterman's reported isolation from the Democratic caucus, high-level staff turnover, and documented concerns regarding his health and cognitive state. We all noted the active outreach from Republicans as a factor that makes a 'Yes' outcome more plausible than it otherwise would be. The consensus is that the situation is highly volatile, justifying a probability well above the base rate for such an event, but that powerful forces still favor the status quo.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my colleagues' analyses, I am lowering my forecast from 20% to 15% to align with their assessments. I found their reasoning convincing, particularly the emphasis placed on the extremely short timeframe until the July 1, 2025 deadline. Forecaster 3's point that executing such a monumental and politically complex decision in just over one month is a very high bar was especially persuasive. While the underlying pressures on Senator Fetterman are severe, translating that pressure into a formal resignation or party switch so quickly is less likely than the continuation of the current, albeit tense, status quo. My initial forecast may have slightly overweighted the severity of the internal turmoil relative to the powerful institutional inertia and the practical, logistical friction of making such a rapid change. The arguments from my peers provided a compelling reason to recalibrate this weighting. I still believe the risk is very significant, but I now see the ~30-day window as a more formidable barrier to a 'Yes' resolution.",
