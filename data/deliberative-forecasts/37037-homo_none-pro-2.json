    "review": "The deliberation revealed a critical factual disagreement about the status quo. My initial forecast and Forecaster 3's forecast were predicated on the assumption that the 50% tariff currently exists, based on a 2018 news article and the principle of bureaucratic inertia. Forecaster 2's analysis challenged this fundamental premise, claiming a direct check of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) shows no such tariff. Forecaster 2's reasoning is the most convincing because it is based on a direct verification of the primary source document central to the resolution criteria, whereas my initial analysis and Forecaster 3's relied on outdated, secondary information. This prompted me to verify the source myself. Forecaster 2's argument is demonstrably correct; the tariff does not appear to exist in the current HTS. This completely inverts the problem from one of bureaucratic inertia maintaining a tariff to the extreme unlikelihood of a new tariff being implemented in a short timeframe.",
    "rationale": "I am making a major update to my forecast, moving from 98% to 2%. This 96-point shift is a direct result of Forecaster 2's analysis, which correctly identified that the premise of my initial forecast was flawed. My original reasoning depended on the continued existence of an erroneous tariff first reported in a 2018 AP article. However, as Forecaster 2 pointed out, and as I have now verified myself by checking the official U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) via the link in the resolution criteria, there is no apparent '+ 50%' tariff listed for Lesotho under the relevant subheading or any other discoverable subheading. \n\nThe status quo is therefore a 'No' outcome, not a 'Yes' outcome. The question now becomes: What is the probability that the U.S. government will actively introduce a new 50% tariff on this specific good from Lesotho before June 1, 2025? The likelihood of this is exceptionally low. There is no ongoing trade dispute, and Lesotho is a beneficiary under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Imposing such a tariff would require a specific, motivated action that runs contrary to current policy, and there is no indication whatsoever that such a change is contemplated. My new forecast of 2% reflects the extremely low probability of this occurring, while allowing for a minuscule chance of a major clerical error re-introducing the tariff or my own misunderstanding of an exceptionally obscure part of the HTS.",
