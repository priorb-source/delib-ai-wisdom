    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 2 months (until end of June 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No test occurs before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "North Korea continues missile launches and hostile rhetoric but avoids a nuclear detonation, preserving leverage for later (e.g., around larger exercises or autumn anniversaries), heeding some Chinese restraint, and deciding the political cost-benefit doesn’t favor a test in May–June.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Pyongyang conducts a seventh test at Punggye-ri to validate a new (possibly tactical) warhead design or signal resolve to Washington/Seoul, timed to a perceived provocation or domestic milestone; IMS/CTBTO registers a seismic event consistent with a nuclear explosion and credible sources confirm.",
    "rationale": "Time left is short. The status quo since 2017 has been no nuclear tests, despite repeated assessments since 2022 that Punggye-ri appeared test-ready. That long hiatus, plus the absence of a clear, recurring trigger in May–June, makes “no test” the base case. Historically, DPRK tests cluster around certain political or signaling needs; while May has seen a test (2009), most windows pass without one. Countervailing factors keep the probability above very low: indications since 2022 that the site is reconstituted, DPRK’s continued qualitative nuclear/missile development, and potentially reduced diplomatic costs given deeper ties with Russia and a tense regional environment. With only ~61 days left, even a regime willing to test needs preparatory signals (e.g., tunnel works, cabling, site lockdown) that would likely leak via satellite or allied warnings; absent such signals, odds stay modest. Why not higher: seven-plus years with zero tests, short window, lack of a known imminent trigger, and the regime’s demonstrated willingness to hold leverage. Why not lower: readiness indicators in recent years, regime unpredictability, and the possibility of a sudden political decision to validate new designs. What would move me up: credible satellite imagery of intensified activity at Punggye-ri (vehicle convoys, cabling, ventilation changes), allied intelligence warnings of an imminent test, DPRK state media foreshadowing a qualitative nuclear step, or a sharp escalation cycle (e.g., direct clashes or new sanctions drives) that Pyongyang answers with a detonation. What would move me down: visible de-escalation signals (high-level China-DPRK consultations urging restraint), reporting of technical setbacks at the site, or authoritative assessments that a test window has closed for logistical or seasonal reasons.

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill North Korea test a nuclear weapon before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to Wikipedia, \"North Korea has conducted six nuclear tests, in 2006, 2009, 2013, twice in 2016, and in 2017.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if before July 1, 2025, North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, according to [credible source](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) reporting such as the [International Monitoring System’s ](https://www.ctbto.org/our-work/detecting-nuclear-tests) and the sources cited at Wikipedia's [List of nuclear weapons tests of North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_nuclear_weapons_tests_of_North_Korea).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-01.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
