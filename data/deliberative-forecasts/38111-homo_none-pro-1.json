    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identified the new UK-France initiative as the primary driver of the forecast, significantly increasing the probability of a 'Yes' outcome. We also all identified potential diplomatic pressure from the US and Israel as the main source of downside risk. The core disagreement is on the speed at which this diplomatic momentum will translate into a formal recognition within the specific one-month window of June 2025. Forecaster 2 (70%) and I (65%) initially gave more weight to the idea that such initiatives are launched to create immediate action, making June a highly likely outcome. Forecaster 3 (45%) presented a compelling counter-argument, emphasizing the inherent slowness of diplomatic processes and the strength of the status quo prior, where G7-led shifts often take longer than a month to materialize. This argument that bureaucratic timelines or successful counter-lobbying could easily push a recognition from late June into July is a valid point that I had not weighted heavily enough.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I am slightly moderating my forecast downwards. My core reasoning remains unchanged: the joint initiative by France and the UK is a watershed moment that creates significant momentum and provides political cover for other nations to recognize Palestine. I agree with Forecaster 2 that this has disrupted the status quo, making imminent action more likely than not. However, I find Forecaster 3's point about the slow pace of diplomacy to be a crucial check on my optimism. The distinction between launching an initiative and a country completing its internal process for a formal announcement is significant. A minor delay caused by internal politics or external pressure could easily push a planned June recognition into July, which would resolve this question as 'No'. While I still believe the initiative was likely timed to trigger a pre-planned, coordinated action within weeks, Forecaster 3's argument convinces me to incorporate a higher probability for such a short-term slip. Therefore, I am lowering my forecast slightly from 65% to 60%, reflecting this increased uncertainty while maintaining my view that 'Yes' is still the more probable outcome.",
