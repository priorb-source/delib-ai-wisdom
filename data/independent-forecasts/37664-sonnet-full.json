  "information": "Anthropic's historical release cadence for major versions shows a lengthening gap: approximately 5 months between Claude 1 (March 2023) and Claude 2 (July 2023), and approximately 8 months between Claude 2 and Claude 3 (March 2024). Previous numbered Claude models have been made available to paid web users and via API within 48 hours of their announcement, without a public waitlist.\n\nAccording to reports from Cursor-IDE (May 15) and ZDNet (May 16), a next-generation Anthropic model codenamed 'Claude Neptune' completed its red-team testing phase on May 18. The same reports indicate a target for general availability in late May or early June. In the past, Anthropic has used internal codenames that later became part of public branding, such as the codename 'Asimov' for the models released as the Claude 3 family.\n\nA February 2025 report from Sina Finance described plans for Claude 4 to be a hybrid model combining a general-purpose model with a reasoning model, which would allow users to adjust the computational resources used for a given task. Other mentions in tech-focused publications, such as a March 2025 post on DEV Community and information on the PromptLayer blog, have framed the release of Claude 4 as expected 'later in 2025'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6-7 weeks until July 1, 2025 (today is May 16, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Claude 4 is not currently publicly available, and without a confirmed imminent release, the default outcome would be that it remains unavailable before the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 'Claude Neptune' model turns out to be a Claude 3.X variant rather than Claude 4, or Anthropic delays the Claude 4 release beyond July 1, 2025, continuing the pattern of lengthening gaps between major versions. Alternatively, Neptune releases in late May/early June but with a waitlist or limited access period that extends past the deadline",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The 'Claude Neptune' model that completed red-team testing on May 18 is indeed Claude 4, and Anthropic follows its historical pattern of making new numbered versions available to the general public within 48 hours of announcement. The late May or early June target date mentioned in recent reports proves accurate, giving Claude 4 roughly 4-6 weeks of public availability before July 1",
    "rationale": "The forecast hinges on whether recent reports about 'Claude Neptune' refer to Claude 4 and whether the stated late May/early June timeline materializes. Favorable factors: (1) Very specific, recent reports from Cursor-IDE and ZDNet citing red-team completion on May 18 with a late May/early June target; (2) Anthropic's historical pattern of releasing numbered versions without waitlists within 48 hours of announcement; (3) The use of codenames like 'Asimov' for Claude 3 suggests Neptune could indeed be Claude 4; (4) The 6-7 week window provides reasonable time for a release. Unfavorable factors: (1) The historical pattern shows lengthening gaps between versions (5 months, then 8 months), which would suggest waiting longer after March 2024's Claude 3; (2) Broader reports frame Claude 4 as expected 'later in 2025,' which could mean after July 1; (3) Uncertainty whether Neptune is Claude 4 or a Claude 3.X variant; (4) Tech rumors are often inaccurate or delayed. The status quo (no release) deserves significant weight given how recently Claude 3 was released (March 2024, only 14 months ago) and the pattern of lengthening development cycles. However, the specificity of the Neptune reports—particularly the red-team completion date and narrow release window—provides meaningful evidence against pure status quo thinking. For this forecast to increase, I'd need: confirmation that Neptune is indeed Claude 4, official Anthropic announcements or leaks, or patterns suggesting accelerated development. For it to decrease: clarification that Neptune is Claude 3.X, delays in the reported timeline, or official statements suggesting a later 2025 release",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAnthropic's historical release cadence for major versions shows a lengthening gap: approximately 5 months between Claude 1 (March 2023) and Claude 2 (July 2023), and approximately 8 months between Claude 2 and Claude 3 (March 2024).
