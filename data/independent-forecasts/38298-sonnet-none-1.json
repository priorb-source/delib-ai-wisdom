    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1-2 weeks. NOAA typically releases monthly global temperature data 2-3 weeks after month-end, so the May 2025 data should be published by mid-June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo suggests a moderately high probability of a record. The planet has been in an unprecedented warming period through 2023-2024, with many months breaking temperature records. However, we're transitioning from El Niño conditions which typically enhance global temperatures, potentially leading to some moderation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 would not be the hottest May if cooling from the El Niño to La Niña transition is stronger than expected, or if May 2024 (or another recent May) set such an exceptionally high bar that natural monthly variability keeps May 2025 from surpassing it. Regional weather patterns could also produce a May that's warm but not record-breaking globally.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "May 2025 becomes the hottest May if the long-term warming trend continues to dominate over any cooling from the ENSO transition, or if atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns in May 2025 happen to align favorably with warm anomalies in key regions that drive the global average.",
    "rationale": "This forecast balances several competing factors. On one hand, the 2023-2024 period has seen extraordinary global warmth with numerous monthly records falling, suggesting momentum toward continued records. The underlying climate change trend continues to push baseline temperatures higher each decade. On the other hand, we're currently transitioning from El Niño (warming influence) toward neutral or La Niña conditions, which could moderate temperatures. Additionally, after an extended period of record-breaking months, some statistical regression toward the mean becomes more likely - May 2024 likely set a very high bar. Without specific preliminary data from my research assistant about May 2025 temperatures or how May 2024 ranked historically, I must weigh these factors with appropriate uncertainty. The forecast would increase if preliminary data showed May 2025 running exceptionally warm, or if May 2024 was only marginally the previous record. It would decrease if May 2024 was an extreme outlier or if early signals suggest May 2025 was relatively cool. The 40% probability reflects that while conditions favor warmth, beating the specific previous May record requires the confluence of trend and favorable variability.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA report that May 2025 is the hottest May on record?\n\nQuestion background:\n[NOAA Climate change impacts](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NOAA at its [Climate at a Glance Global Rankings](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/rankings/globe/tavg/land_ocean/202504) tracker reports that May 2025 is the 1st warmest on record.\n\nEnsure that Region is set to Global. Ensure that Surface is set to Land and Ocean.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
