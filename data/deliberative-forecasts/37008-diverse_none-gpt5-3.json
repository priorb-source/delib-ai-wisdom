    "review": "Both forecasters weigh the explicit April 29 expiry against the persistence of infrastructure crises. Forecaster 2 adds a useful point that critical generation failures are often not fixed in 30 days, making extensions common; Forecaster 3 emphasizes the base-rate/status-quo that expiration requires no action while extension requires an active step. Neither brings new hard evidence, but F3’s reminder to weight the status quo strongly is salient given the lack of signals about an extension. F2’s point prevents going too low, since power crises do often drag on and extensions can be last-minute.",
    "rationale": "The currently declared emergency ends April 29, so No is the status quo. For a Yes, the government must extend or issue a new emergency within nine days. With no reports of worsening conditions or official hints of extension, I put more weight on expiration. Countervailing risk remains non-trivial: major generator failures and procurement/repair timelines can exceed a month, and governments sometimes roll extensions close to the deadline. Other pathways to Yes (e.g., a new hazard like a late-season cyclone) exist but are low probability. Balancing these, I slightly trim my prior 30% toward the status quo, while keeping a meaningful tail for a last-minute extension driven by unresolved power issues.",
