  "information": "GameStop's annual shareholder meetings have historically been held in the first half of June. Recent meetings have shown a pattern of being held on a Thursday. Past dates include June 2, 2022 (Thursday), June 15, 2023 (Thursday), and an initial schedule of June 13, 2024 (Thursday). The 2024 virtual meeting was adjourned to a later date after its servers crashed due to overwhelming interest from shareholders attempting to join the webcast.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About two weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. Corporate annual meetings are typically scheduled far in advance and proceed as planned. The date of Thursday, June 12, 2025, aligns with GameStop's historical pattern of holding meetings on a Thursday in the first half of June.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "GameStop again underestimates the massive interest from retail shareholders. The virtual meeting platform's servers are overwhelmed, causing the meeting to be prematurely adjourned and rescheduled, mirroring the events of the 2024 meeting.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Having learned from the 2024 server crash, GameStop invests in a robust virtual meeting infrastructure capable of handling the high traffic. The meeting is held on the scheduled date, June 12, 2025, and concludes without any significant technical disruptions.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is primarily based on the high predictability of corporate governance schedules. GameStop's past meetings have consistently occurred on Thursdays in early to mid-June, and June 12, 2025, fits this pattern perfectly. The status quo for any public company is to hold its annual meeting on the announced date. The primary risk factor, which prevents a higher probability, is the severe technical failure that led to the postponement of the 2024 meeting. This event demonstrates a specific, recent vulnerability to high shareholder interest. However, I believe the company has a very strong incentive—both reputational and operational—to prevent a recurrence. With a full year to prepare and the failure as a lesson, it is highly probable they will contract with a provider who can guarantee the required capacity. My forecast is not higher because the meme-stock nature of GameStop makes attendance levels uniquely unpredictable, and a repeat technical failure remains a non-trivial risk. My forecast is not lower because assuming a competent management team, a year is more than sufficient time to solve this known technical challenge, making success the most likely outcome. I would increase my forecast upon confirmation of a contract with a top-tier virtual event provider and decrease it if the stock experiences extreme, unexpected volatility in the days leading up to the meeting, suggesting attendance could exceed even the new preparations.",
