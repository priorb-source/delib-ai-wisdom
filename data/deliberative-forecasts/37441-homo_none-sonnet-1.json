    "review": "All three forecasts converged remarkably on 18-20%, which suggests reasonable calibration. The key arguments are consistent: we're already at 3-year lows (estimated ~0.87-0.92 EUR/USD), requiring an additional 8-15% dollar depreciation to reach 0.80 in just 7 weeks. Forecaster 2 raises an interesting counterpoint I hadn't fully considered - that being at 3-year lows might actually suggest 'less room to fall rather than more' since negative news is already priced in. This is a valid observation about market dynamics. However, all forecasters acknowledge the elevated tail risk from tariff turmoil. The consensus on similar upward/downward revision triggers (approaching 0.82-0.83, tariff escalation/de-escalation) validates the analytical framework. A significant gap in all analyses is that none of us know the precise current exchange rate, which would materially affect the probability. The question's wording 'at any point' means even a brief touch of 0.80 would resolve Yes, which slightly favors higher probabilities than if sustained levels were required.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I'm reinforcing my view that 18% is appropriate. Forecaster 2's 'priced in' argument has merit - markets experiencing sharp moves often stabilize rather than continue accelerating, especially after hitting multi-year extremes. This could argue for a slightly lower probability. However, three factors keep me from decreasing my forecast: (1) currency crises can become self-reinforcing through confidence effects, (2) the tariff situation remains fluid and could escalate unpredictably, (3) we only need a brief touch of 0.80, not sustained levels. The convergence of all three forecasters on 18-20% provides confidence this range captures the right balance between tail risk from ongoing turmoil and the low base rate of extreme currency moves in short timeframes. Without knowing the current exact rate, maintaining 18% reflects appropriate uncertainty while acknowledging that reaching 0.80 would require exceptional circumstances.",
