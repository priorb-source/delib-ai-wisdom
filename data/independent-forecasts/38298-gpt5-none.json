    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 1–2 weeks (NOAA typically posts global monthly rankings around mid-June for May).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the recent run of record-warm months and persistently extreme global sea-surface temperatures make another record the default expectation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "NOAA ranks May 2025 as 2nd warmest (likely just behind May 2024) due to a modest step-down as El Niño wanes, slightly cooler land anomalies, or dataset-specific differences that keep the NOAA blend just below last year’s record.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Ocean warmth remains exceptionally high and, with lagged El Niño effects plus broad-based warmth on land, NOAA’s land+ocean blend edges out May 2024, placing May 2025 as the warmest May on record.",
    "rationale": "Context: The last year has featured unprecedented global warmth, with many consecutive monthly records across multiple datasets. Sea-surface temperatures remained exceptionally high into spring 2025, and the lagged effect from the strong 2023–24 El Niño typically keeps global temperatures elevated into late spring. That sets a high prior that May 2025 will be near or at the top of the NOAA rankings.\nStatus quo weighting: Given the persistence of marine heat and recent record streaks, the status quo points to a Yes outcome. However, NOAA’s record to beat (May 2024) is a high bar, and small methodological or spatial anomaly differences can flip a close call.\nWhy not higher? (Ceiling): El Niño is transitioning toward neutral, which can shave a few hundredths of a degree off anomalies; NOAA’s methodology and baseline sometimes yield slightly lower rankings than Copernicus/ERA5 for tight races; if land areas cooled slightly relative to 2024 while oceans remained hot, May could land second.\nWhy not lower? (Floor): Background anthropogenic warming plus persistently extreme ocean temperatures and lag effects strongly support another top-1 or top-2 outcome; the odds of being far below record are low.\nUpdates that would move me up: Copernicus/ERA5 confirming May 2025 as warmest May on record; continued reports that global mean SSTs hit or stayed near all-time daily records through May; preliminary national datasets (e.g., GISTEMP) showing record May.\nUpdates that would move me down: Early major dataset(s) show May 2025 only 2nd warmest; NOAA’s preliminary daily or weekly ocean anomalies indicate a notable step-down vs May 2024; signs that land temperatures were distinctly cooler than last year.\nResearch assistant note: No additional information provided; forecast relies on known release timing, recent global temperature behavior, and cross-dataset patterns.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill NOAA report that May 2025 is the hottest May on record?\n\nQuestion background:\n[NOAA Climate change impacts](https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/climate/climate-change-impacts)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if NOAA at its [Climate at a Glance Global Rankings](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/climate-at-a-glance/global/rankings/globe/tavg/land_ocean/202504) tracker reports that May 2025 is the 1st warmest on record.\n\nEnsure that Region is set to Global. Ensure that Surface is set to Land and Ocean.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
