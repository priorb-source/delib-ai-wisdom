    "review": "All forecasters correctly identified the central tension between Beto O'Rourke's history of early campaign announcements and the current lack of visible campaign infrastructure. My initial analysis and Forecaster 2's analysis were very similar, both arriving at 40% by weighing the lack of current activity more heavily than historical precedent. However, Forecaster 3 made a compelling argument that I had not sufficiently considered: the strategic necessity of an early announcement for a statewide Texas race. They argued that waiting past summer 2025 would be a significant strategic disadvantage, reframing the timeline as not just a personal pattern but a political imperative. This reframing, along with characterizing O'Rourke's recent statements as a classic 'trial balloon' signaling imminent action, was particularly persuasive.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 40% was based on weighing the lack of observable campaign preparation (no FEC filings, no reported staff hires) more heavily than O'Rourke's past behavior. While his history of early announcements made a 'Yes' plausible, the concrete evidence in the present pointed towards 'No'. After reviewing the other analyses, I find Forecaster 3's reasoning compelling enough to update my forecast. The argument that a serious candidate *must* launch a campaign by this point to be viable in a state the size of Texas adds a crucial layer of strategic logic. A campaign can be prepared privately and launched suddenly, meaning the lack of public evidence is a weaker negative signal than I initially thought. The strategic pressure to announce soon, combined with his established pattern and public signaling, now makes a pre-July 1 announcement appear more likely than not. Therefore, I am increasing my forecast from 40% to 55%, shifting my assessment from slightly improbable to slightly probable.",
