  "information": "As of the last filing for Q4 2024, Berkshire Hathaway held approximately 10.7 million shares of Amazon. For 10 consecutive quarters, the company has been a net seller of equities. In Q1 2025, Berkshire increased its cash reserves to a record of approximately $348 billion. During that same quarter, the company's operating earnings declined by 14.1%, and no stock repurchases were made. New investments were focused on the energy sector and Japanese trading firms.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 7 days (13F due by May 15, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Berkshire’s last reported AMZN stake was ~10.7M shares; if unchanged or only slightly trimmed, the 13F will still show >10M shares.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire trims the AMZN position below 10,000,000 shares (or exits/withholds via confidentiality), resulting in a reported holding at or under 10M in the Q1 2025 13F.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Berkshire maintains or increases its AMZN position such that the Q1 2025 13F shows more than 10,000,000 shares (including small trims that still leave >10M).",
    "rationale": "Anchor on the base: recent 13Fs have shown Berkshire holding roughly 10.7M AMZN shares, and the position has been largely static for years, managed by one of the lieutenants (Ted/Todd). Given that the resolution criterion is simply “>10,000,000 shares,” Berkshire would have to reduce by ~700k shares (~6–7%) or more for a No. The research assistant notes Berkshire has been a net seller of equities for 10 straight quarters and lifted cash to a record in Q1 2025, with focus on energy and Japanese trading firms and no buybacks. That increases the chance of trims somewhere, but historically Berkshire tends to make larger cash-raising moves in bigger positions (e.g., Apple) rather than a relatively small AMZN stake. Moreover, Berkshire has not actively traded AMZN frequently, lending weight to a status-quo assumption. Reasons the probability isn’t higher: - Continued net-selling and record cash levels raise the possibility of broad-based trimming, including smaller positions like AMZN. - If they were rationalizing smaller holdings, they could plausibly cut AMZN below 10M. - A very low-probability tail is a confidentiality request that temporarily obscures AMZN (unlikely for such a known position). Reasons the probability isn’t lower: - The threshold is forgiving: even a modest trim would still leave >10M. - Long history of the AMZN stake being stable around ~10.7M. - If they needed cash, selling larger, more liquid positions typically accomplishes more with fewer trades. What would move me up: credible signals that Berkshire maintained or added to AMZN (meeting remarks, vetted press leaks, or mid-quarter portfolio chatter), or evidence that selling was concentrated elsewhere (e.g., confirmed large trims in Apple/financials). What would move me down: credible reporting that Berkshire trimmed or exited AMZN, unusual signals of broad small-position clean-up, or indications of a confidentiality treatment that could omit AMZN from the 13F.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Berkshire Hathaway reveal a purchase of more Amazon stock in its Q1 2025 13F filing?\n\nQuestion background:\nStockCircle: [Berkshire Hathaway's Amazon Stake](https://stockcircle.com/portfolio/warren-buffett/amzn/transactions)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the 13F filing for Berkshire Hathaway, Inc., filed for the period ending 2025-03-31, reports the company holding greater than 10,000,000 shares of Amazon.com, Inc.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of the last filing for Q4 2024, Berkshire Hathaway held approximately 10.7 million shares of Amazon. For 10 consecutive quarters, the company has been a net seller of equities. In Q1 2025, Berkshire increased its cash reserves to a record of approximately $348 billion.

New investments were focused on the energy sector and Japanese trading firms.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
