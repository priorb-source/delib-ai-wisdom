  "information": "As of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro officially excluded Tesla products, including electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters, from its CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs. The stated reason for the policy change is to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S.-produced goods where practicable, as part of a broader trade dispute. The EV charger rebate for single-family homes covers up to 50% of the cost, to a maximum of $350. The policy was publicly defended by B.C. Premier David Eby and Energy Minister Adrian Dix. Products purchased or pre-approved before March 12, 2025, remain eligible for the rebate.\n\nIn the Canadian market, Tesla has experienced a significant downturn in early 2025. New vehicle registrations in Québec dropped by 85-90% in the first quarter of the year. Concurrently, a J.D. Power survey indicated a shift in Canadian consumer preference, with Tesla falling from second to eighth place among most-considered EV brands. Other manufacturers, such as General Motors, surpassed Tesla as the top seller of EVs in Canada during this period. Public sentiment has also been a factor, with protests occurring at a B.C. Tesla dealership on March 23, 2025, where participants called for a boycott of the company.\n\nThe exclusion of Tesla from B.C.'s rebate program occurred within a broader context of shifting trade policies and incentives. Canada's federal iZEV rebate program, which offered up to $5,000 for EV purchases, ended on March 31, 2025. A 25% tariff on U.S.-made electric vehicles is also in effect. The B.C. government's action to preference domestic goods extends beyond the EV sector; for instance, the province has also removed U.S. liquor products from the shelves of government-run liquor stores as part of the ongoing trade friction with the United States.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the BC Hydro page still explicitly says Tesla products are not eligible for the home EV charger rebate.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "BC Hydro revises the page before or in early July to remove brand-specific language (e.g., switches to generic wording like “U.S.-made products are ineligible” without naming Tesla), restructures the page/program so the Tesla line disappears, or reverses course and restores Tesla eligibility for home chargers.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The March 12, 2025 exclusion language or equivalent brand-specific statement naming Tesla remains on the specified BC Hydro page on/after July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Time horizon is short and the policy is newly announced and politically defended. As of Mar 12, 2025, BC Hydro/BC government explicitly excluded Tesla products from CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates to preference Canadian goods and exclude U.S.-produced goods. Premier Eby and Energy Minister Dix publicly backed the move. Newly implemented, politically salient rules tend to persist over a 1–3 month window. \n- Broader context from the assistant’s report strengthens stickiness: active Canada–U.S. trade frictions, a 25% tariff on U.S.-made EVs, and other BC actions (e.g., removal of U.S. liquor from government stores). These signals point to a coordinated, not ad hoc, policy stance—less likely to be reversed within a month. \n- Market/political incentives don’t push toward a quick reversal: Tesla’s Canadian momentum weakened in early 2025 (sharp sales drop in Quebec; decline in brand consideration). There is little near-term pressure to carve out an exception for Tesla specifically. \n- Key risk to a Yes resolution is not a policy reversal but a wording change: the Metaculus criterion requires that the BC Hydro page explicitly mention Tesla being ineligible. If BC Hydro moves to brand-agnostic phrasing or reorganizes the content (or closes/pauses the program page), the question would resolve No even if the practical exclusion continues. That said, given the consumer-facing nature of the rebate, leaving the Tesla call-out in place reduces confusion and is likely to remain through early July. \nWhy not higher? Nontrivial risk (25–30%) that website language shifts to generic exclusion or the page is restructured by July 1, which would resolve No even without a policy change. Also a small chance of a tactical softening for EV chargers specifically. \nWhy not lower? Strong political commitment, alignment with broader trade posture, and the short time window favor status quo persistence. \nWhat would move me up? Public statements or page updates in June reaffirming or expanding brand-specific ineligibility, or evidence the trade measures are being intensified. \nWhat would move me down? BC Hydro migrating or redesigning the rebate pages, adopting brand-agnostic eligibility wording, hints of legal/trade pushback prompting more neutral language, or announcements of program redesign that omit specific brand exclusions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill BC Hydro still exclude Tesla from its EV charger rebate program for single-family homes in July 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"The Government of B.C. and BC Hydro are taking action to preference Canadian goods in our rebate programs going forward and to exclude, where practicable, U.S. produced goods. As of March 12, 2025, Tesla products (electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries and inverters) are not eligible for CleanBC and BC Hydro rebates. If you purchased or have received pre-approval for your Tesla product before March 12, 2025, it can still qualify for rebates and will be processed as normal.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if BC Hydro at [this page](https://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/electric-vehicles/rebates-incentives/rebates-home-chargers.html) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, says that Tesla products are not eligible for the EV charger at home program. If it does not mention Tesla being ineligible, then this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of March 12, 2025, BC Hydro officially excluded Tesla products, including electric vehicle chargers, energy storage batteries, and inverters, from its CleanBC and BC Hydro rebate programs.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
