    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months, with the question resolving on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo is a dynamic environment of frequent political and social demonstrations in India. Given this, the default expectation is that large protests are plausible at any time, suggesting a moderate likelihood of a 'Yes' outcome even within a short timeframe.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The period between now and July 1, 2025, remains relatively calm without any single issue galvanizing a mass protest of over 10,000 people. Alternatively, a protest of this size could occur, but due to reporting lags, it is not added to the Global Protest Tracker database before the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A contentious political, social, or economic issue, such as the land law mentioned in the background article, agricultural reforms, or a state-level policy, triggers widespread demonstrations. At least one of these events draws more than 10,000 participants and is documented by news sources that are then cataloged by the Global Protest Tracker before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of 55% balances India's high propensity for large-scale protests against the very short timeframe for this question. The primary factor supporting a 'Yes' outcome is India's history as one of the world's most active locations for mass demonstrations. Issues related to farming, citizenship laws, and regional disputes have repeatedly mobilized tens of thousands of people in recent years. The provided background article indicates there are currently active and volatile issues, specifically the 'Muslim land law' in eastern India, which could serve as a catalyst. \n\nThe primary factor weighing against a 'Yes' outcome, and why my forecast is not higher, is the brief resolution window of less than two months. Large protests are not a weekly occurrence, and there is a significant chance that no single event will cross the 10,000-participant threshold and be reported by the specific source within this period. The resolution depends not only on a protest occurring but also on the Carnegie Endowment's tracker updating its database, which may have a lag. \n\nMy forecast is not lower because the 10,000-participant threshold is relatively modest in the Indian context, and a single qualifying event is all that is required. The existence of a specific, recent, and fatal protest as noted in the Reuters article suggests the underlying conditions for unrest are present. \n\nI would increase my forecast if new, highly controversial national legislation is announced or if the protests in eastern India demonstrably spread to other regions. I would decrease my forecast if there is a de-escalation of current tensions and no new major points of contention emerge in the next few weeks.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Global Protest Tracker report any protests in India with 10,000+ participants, before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nReuters: [Three dead as protests against Muslim land law turn violent in eastern India](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/three-dead-protests-against-muslim-land-law-turn-violent-eastern-india-2025-04-14/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Global Protest Tracker](https://carnegieendowment.org/features/global-protest-tracker?lang=en) reports a protest in India with 10,000 or more participants with a start date after the launch of this question and before July 1, 2025.\n\nA protest with at least 10,000 participants that is active at the launch of this question does not count for resolution.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
