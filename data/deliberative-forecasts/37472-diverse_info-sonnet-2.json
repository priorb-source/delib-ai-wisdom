    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises an excellent point I completely overlooked: Khaleda Zia's return on May 6, 2025. This is genuinely significant new information. In Bangladesh's personality-driven politics, physical presence matters enormously, and Hasina's continued absence while her longtime rival is actively engaged does create real political pressure. However, I think Forecaster 2 may overweight this factor in the short timeframe. Political pressure is one thing, but walking into near-certain arrest on crimes against humanity charges is quite another. Leaders respond to such pressure strategically over months or years, not weeks. The fact that it's been only 2 days since Zia's return with no signals of Hasina preparing a counter-move suggests this won't materialize in our 54-day window.\n\nForecaster 3's focus on extradition mechanics is valuable and provides useful detail about the December 2024 request and India's non-response through February 2025. This reinforces that the extradition pathway is moving slowly. However, we're now 3 months past that February reference point, so there could have been developments. The emphasis on bureaucratic timelines is well-founded but perhaps slightly overstates the friction, as political decisions can override normal processes.\n\nBoth forecasters are in my range (13-20%), which provides some validation of the probability space. The key question is whether Zia's return is a game-changer. I believe it creates meaningful additional pressure but insufficient to overcome the legal/security barriers in this compressed timeframe.",
    "rationale": "My updated analysis: The Khaleda Zia return on May 6 is the most significant new information, creating genuine political pressure on Hasina in a personality-driven political system. This moves me slightly upward from my original 18%. However, several factors prevent a larger update: (1) Only 2 days have passed since Zia's return with no signals of Hasina preparing to respond; (2) The crimes against humanity investigation reaching final stages in May 2025 makes the legal jeopardy extremely acute right now; (3) Political pressure typically manifests over longer timeframes than 54 days when the costs are this high; (4) The extradition process appears slow with no indication of imminent action from India.\n\nThe core logic remains: status quo strongly favors exile, legal and security barriers are formidable, and the timeframe is very short. The Zia factor adds marginal pressure but doesn't fundamentally change the calculus. If Hasina were planning a dramatic return in response to her rival, we would likely see preparatory signals (security negotiations, political statements about imminent return, travel movements) which are absent. I'm moving my forecast up modestly to acknowledge the Zia factor while maintaining that the baseline scenario of continued exile remains dominant.",
