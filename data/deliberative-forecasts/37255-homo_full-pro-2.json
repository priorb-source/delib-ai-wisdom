    "review": "All three forecasters have reached a strong consensus, identifying the same four key factors pointing towards a 'No' outcome: the extremely short two-month timeline, Libya's severe political fragmentation, the government's stated focus on a bilateral trade deal with Turkey, and the lack of external pressure due to the AfCFTA's own implementation delays. The reasoning is convincing and aligns perfectly across all analyses. The only difference is my initial forecast of 3% versus their 5%. They did not raise any arguments I hadn't fundamentally considered, but Forecaster 2's specific framing of a 'Yes' scenario as a possible 'ratification by decree' is a useful clarification of how a symbolic gesture might be enacted in a country with a non-functional legislature. This specific mechanism slightly increases the plausibility of an outlier event.",
    "rationale": "My core reasoning remains unchanged. The combination of a two-month deadline, a politically paralyzed state, and a clear competing trade priority with Turkey makes ratification before July 1, 2025, extremely unlikely. However, I am updating my forecast from 3% to 5% to align with the other experts. This change is not due to new evidence, but rather a calibration in response to their deliberation. Their collective judgment that 5% is an appropriate floor to account for a low-probability, unexpected event—such as a symbolic 'ratification by decree' by one of Libya's competing governments seeking international legitimacy—has convinced me that my initial 3% was slightly too low. I am therefore making a minor upward adjustment to better reflect this tail risk, which is more plausible in a volatile political environment like Libya's.",
