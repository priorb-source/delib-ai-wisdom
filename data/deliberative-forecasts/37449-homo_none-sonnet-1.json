    "review": "All three forecasters converged on remarkably similar probabilities (3-4%) using parallel reasoning frameworks, which increases my confidence that this range is well-calibrated. The key shared insights are: (1) the compressed 8-week timeframe makes dramatic escalation unlikely, (2) absence of current crisis indicators is significant, (3) capability articles don't signal imminent intent, (4) status quo bias strongly applies, and (5) the lower bar of requiring only a US accusation rather than verified blockade modestly elevates the probability. Forecaster 2 made an excellent point about gray-zone operations potentially being characterized as blockades - this is a realistic scenario where something short of a full naval blockade could trigger the US accusation. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the historical rarity of naval blockades as acts of war provides helpful grounding. Both forecasters articulated systematic update conditions more clearly than I initially did. The convergence across three independent analysts using sound methodology suggests we're not missing major considerations. The tight clustering of forecasts (3-4%) indicates this is not a question where reasonable analysts would diverge wildly, which itself is informative about the probability range.",
    "rationale": "My original 4% forecast was based on weighing the extremely low base rate of major military escalations against the non-zero risk of tail events. After reviewing the other analyses, I find they reinforce rather than challenge my reasoning. The convergence at 3-4% from three independent forecasters suggests this probability range appropriately balances: (1) the strong likelihood that 8 weeks passes without unprecedented Chinese military action, (2) the genuine but manageable Taiwan Strait tensions, and (3) the possibility of gray-zone operations or incidents being characterized by the US as blockades. No forecaster presented information suggesting current crisis dynamics I wasn't aware of. The main refinement from the deliberation is recognizing that gray-zone maritime harassment could potentially meet the 'blockade' characterization threshold for US political rhetoric, though this remains unlikely. The historical rarity of naval blockades and absence of warning indicators continue to dominate the analysis. My 4% sits comfortably within the tight 3-4% range and reflects appropriate epistemic humility about tail risks while respecting base rates.",
