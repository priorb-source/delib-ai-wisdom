    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: PNM has a structural path via FPTP and potential Tobago vote-splitting; UNC has anti-incumbent tailwinds, a coalition with COP, and salient crime concerns. They add no substantively new data beyond the Guardian TT/Hamid Ghany finding and the (likely low-quality) WIC News poll. I’m not fully convinced by the notion that a large undecided bloc is more likely to break to the incumbent in this context; with an early election after a leadership change and crime salience, undecideds could plausibly tilt toward change. Tobago’s two-seat advantage for PNM is meaningful but capped; a small swing in a few Trinidad marginals could offset it. Overall, their reasoning is sound and balanced, nudging me slightly toward a narrower PNM edge.",
    "rationale": "Core view unchanged: In FPTP, PNM’s map and potential Tobago opposition split provide a clear path to a plurality even if the popular vote is tight. The Guardian TT seat-dynamic signal matters more than national toplines, and I continue to heavily discount the WIC News 72–18 figure. Countervailing: early election/leadership transition (Rowley to Young), crime salience, and an opposition coalition increase the risk of a late break toward UNC in key Trinidad marginals. With about a fifth of voters undecided/split and only days left, the distribution of late deciders is pivotal; I no longer assume a tilt toward the incumbent given the environment. Net: still slightly PNM-favored, but with enough anti-incumbent risk to shave a couple of points. I’m moving from 58% to 56%.",
