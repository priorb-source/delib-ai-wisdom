    "review": "Both forecasters reinforce the same core frame I used: base rate for recalls (about 60% succeed), unusually damaging case facts, tiny mail-ballot electorate where motivated recall backers can dominate. New useful nuances they raised: (1) small-N volatility cuts both ways but usually doesn’t overcome such severe allegations; (2) the status-quo outcome absent new information is removal; (3) mail-ballot timing implies many votes are already cast, limiting late persuasion. Forecaster 3’s point about potential status-quo/older-homeowner turnout slightly aiding retention is a fair counter, but given the gravity and salience of the incident, I agree with their overall tilt toward removal. No materially new factual information emerged, but their emphasis on timing and salience in a very small electorate nudges me a bit lower than my prior.",
    "rationale": "Starting from a ~40% retention base rate for recalls that reach the ballot, the specifics here likely depress Metz’s chances: felony charges for shooting a teen in the face, investigators noting no apparent criminal intent by the teen, sustained negative local coverage, and an already-mobilized recall effort in a town with <400 active voters. In small electorates, organized activists often set the outcome, and with ballots already out (and many likely returned) there’s limited runway for narrative change. Countervailing dynamics—personal networks, due-process sentiments, potentially status-quo-leaning older mail voters—add volatility but probably don’t overcome the severity and salience. We lack polling, so uncertainty remains meaningful. Incorporating the other forecasters’ timing and turnout emphasis, I adjust slightly downward from 33% to 28% for retention. Triggers that would move me up: credible reports of strong pro-Metz returns or endorsements; down: reports of high overall turnout without a pro-Metz pocket, additional damaging revelations, or visible community/official support for recall organizers.",
