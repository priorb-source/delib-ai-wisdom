    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "26 days",

    "no_outcome_scenario": "Suarez continues to signal interest or forms/uses a political committee but does not explicitly say he’s running before July 1, opting to wait until later in 2025 to announce or decides against running.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Suarez holds a media event or releases a statement before June 30 to launch a campaign, aiming to capitalize on Q2 fundraising headlines and to stake an early claim in an open-seat GOP primary.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: There are only about 26 days left. With such a short window, the status quo (no announcement) is more likely.\n- Signals to date: Apart from a report that he’s weighing a bid, there’s no confirmed public move toward an imminent launch (e.g., scheduled announcement event, reported senior hires for a gubernatorial campaign, or a formal candidacy statement). The research assistant provided no additional information suggesting an announcement is imminent.\n- Incentives that could push Yes: Announcing before June 30 allows a clean Q2 fundraising story and could help Suarez get out ahead in an open-seat race. Florida statewide hopefuls often benefit from early money and visibility.\n- Reasons for caution (keeping probability below 50): Announcements for 2026 statewide races commonly occur later in 2025 or even early 2026. Suarez’s 2024 presidential bid underperformance and prior controversies may encourage a more deliberate rollout or continued testing rather than a sudden June announcement. With no solid leak or scheduling chatter, a near-term launch is less probable.\n- Why not higher: Lack of concrete pre-launch indicators and the short fuse to July 1.\n- Why not lower: The seat will be open, he’s been publicly weighing it, and the end-of-Q2 fundraising deadline gives a non-trivial reason to move this month.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of a scheduled announcement, visible campaign infrastructure forming (not just exploratory or generic PAC activity), or on-the-record confirmation from Suarez/allies.\n- What would move me down: Reports that he’s delaying, declining, backing another candidate, or facing fresh legal/ethical headwinds that make a June launch unlikely.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Francis Suarez announce his candidacy for Florida governor before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAxios: [Miami mayor weighs gubernatorial bid](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/02/florida-governor-miami-mayor-francis-suarez)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Francis Suarez announces his candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-05.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
