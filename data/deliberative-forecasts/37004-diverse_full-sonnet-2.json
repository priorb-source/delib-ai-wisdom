    "review": "All three forecasts cluster between 15-23%, suggesting strong convergence on a low but non-negligible Conservative probability. Forecaster 2's 15% appears slightly too pessimistic, while Forecaster 3's 22% nearly matches my original 23%. The most important new evidence is Forecaster 3's historical context: Canadian polling errors typically run 1-3 points, meaning overcoming a 5-7 point deficit would require an unusually large miss. This is more compelling than I initially weighted. Forecaster 2's point about advanced voting potentially 'locking in' current preferences also merits consideration, though it's unclear which party benefits more. Forecaster 3's mention of potential Bloc impact in Quebec is theoretically valid but speculative. The commitment gap (76% vs 63%) remains the strongest countervailing factor, as both other forecasters acknowledge but may underweight.",
    "rationale": "I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward from 23% to 20% based on the historical polling error data. If typical Canadian federal polling errors are 1-3 points as Forecaster 3 notes, the Conservatives would need an error at the high end of that range PLUS significant turnout advantages to overcome the 5-7 point deficit. This is possible but stretches the boundaries of normal variation. The advanced voting point also suggests reduced volatility in the final days. However, I'm not going as low as 15% because: (1) the 13-point commitment gap (76% vs 63%) is substantial and historically meaningful for turnout; (2) there remain several days for movement; (3) regional strength in the West plus competitiveness in BC provides a foundation; (4) Conservatives have previously won popular votes while losing seat counts, showing they can outperform in this metric. The convergence of all three forecasts in the 15-23% range increases my confidence that the true probability lies in this band, with 20% representing a reasonable compromise that weights both the substantial polling deficit and the non-trivial turnout/commitment advantages.",
