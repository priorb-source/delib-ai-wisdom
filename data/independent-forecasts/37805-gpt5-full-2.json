  "information": "Saipan has become a popular destination for Korean tourists, who constituted 70% of the island's visitors in 2024. The Governor of Saipan, Arnold Palacios, has identified the Korean tourist market as a primary focus for growth and sustainability. In line with this, the Mariana Visitors Authority launched a marketing campaign titled 'This is the Marianas' for the Korean market. The 2025 Saipan Marathon attracted over 200 Korean participants out of 612 runners from 19 countries. Additionally, KB Kookmin Card initiated a promotional event for its Visa cardholders traveling to destinations including Saipan, offering discounts on flights, hotels, dining, and shopping starting from July 18.\n\nThe weakness of the Japanese yen poses a challenge to tourism in the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI), as Japanese travelers tend to prefer non-U.S. dollar destinations. Japanese visitor numbers to the CNMI were 7,762 in 2023 and 13,779 in 2024, with the increase largely due to cruise ship arrivals. In response, United Airlines has launched a digital advertising campaign for its Narita-Saipan route, and the Marianas Visitors Authority has partnered with Japanese travel agencies. The islands also received diving awards at the 'Marine Diving Fair 2025' in Tokyo, highlighting their appeal. Separately, Hong Kong Airlines lists Saipan as one of its destinations, and travel platform Expedia noted a significant increase in search volume for Saipan from Hong Kong travelers.\n\nAs of mid-May 2025, flight tracking websites indicate that Saipan International Airport (SPN) has three to four non-stop flight destinations. These are Guam (GUM), served by United Airlines; Seoul-Incheon (ICN), served by Jeju Air, T’way Air, and Jin Air; Busan (PUS), served by Jeju Air; and an intermittently listed service to Tokyo-Narita (NRT), operated by United Airlines. A report by the Mastercard Economics Institute notes a general surge in travel within the Asia-Pacific region. Saipan's tourism appeal is supported by sightseeing opportunities related to its history, nature, and culture, including tours of WWII battlefields and natural sites like Managaha Island and The Grotto.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — FlightsFrom currently shows only 3–4 nonstop destinations (GUM, ICN, PUS, and intermittently NRT), which is not greater than 4.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Through early July, FlightsFrom lists only Guam (United), Seoul-Incheon (Jeju Air, T’way, Jin Air), Busan (Jeju Air), and either no Narita listing or a temporarily absent/paused Narita listing. No additional Korean secondary cities or other Asia routes are filed in OAG by then, leaving ≤4 destinations.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "United’s NRT–SPN appears as an active summer route on FlightsFrom, and at least one more destination is added/visible for the summer schedule (e.g., a Korean secondary city like Daegu or Muan, or a new/seasonal route such as Osaka, Hong Kong, or Taipei), bringing the total to ≥5.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline: As of mid-May 2025, SPN has 3–4 direct destinations (GUM, ICN, PUS, and intermittently NRT). The question requires ≥5, so the default outcome is No.\n- Lead times and data source: FlightsFrom relies on filed schedules (OAG). For a new city to count by early July, carriers typically must file in May/June. Seasonal services can appear before first flight if loaded, but last-minute adds are uncommon.\n- Demand context (RA summary): Korean visitors comprised ~70% in 2024; CNMI is prioritizing Korea (marketing campaign, events, card promos). Korean demand is the most plausible driver of any new route (e.g., an added Korean city). However, Japanese demand is dampened by a weak yen; Japanese arrivals increases were cruise-driven. United is advertising NRT–SPN, but overall Japan-origin recovery to USD destinations is soft. Hong Kong Airlines lists Saipan and HK search interest rose, but there’s no firm start-date news for scheduled HKG–SPN.\n- Path to ≥5: If NRT is consistently scheduled for summer, that yields four destinations (GUM, ICN, PUS, NRT). We still need one more city (e.g., an additional Korean secondary city or HKG/TPE/Osaka). With only ~6 weeks left, and absent public announcements, the probability of both NRT being listed and at least one other city appearing is modest.\n- Why not higher: Crossing from 3–4 to ≥5 requires at least one new city beyond the uncertain NRT. Time is short, macro headwinds persist for Japan, and China routes remain unlikely. No concrete airline announcements have surfaced.\n- Why not lower: Korean demand is strong; LCCs sometimes add seasonal Korean secondary-city flights, and FlightsFrom would list them if filed. United’s NRT could be scheduled for summer and visible on the page even if service starts mid/late July.\n- What would move me up: Verified schedule filings on FlightsFrom/OAG for NRT plus any additional city (e.g., Daegu, Muan, Osaka, Hong Kong, Taipei), or official airline announcements with loaded inventory. What would move me down: Absence of NRT on the summer schedule page by mid-June, or indications that Korean carriers won’t add secondary cities for summer.\n",
