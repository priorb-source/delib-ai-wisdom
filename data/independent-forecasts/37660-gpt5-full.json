  "information": "According to a March 25, 2025 report, the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) denied reports of plans to suspend Starlink's satellite broadband service. The TRCSL Director General stated that a 'dashboard system' is required to regulate the service and that its implementation had been delayed. The Director General mentioned that the service was expected to become operational in April 2025 once the necessary systems were in place.\n\nA separate report from March 23, 2025, stated that the Sri Lankan government had put Starlink services on hold until the company guarantees government agencies the right to intercept data or communication details for national security reasons. According to the Deputy Minister of Information Technology, discussions between the Defence Ministry, TRCSL, and Starlink were still at a preliminary stage. The report also noted that the TRCSL had already approved tariff plans for Starlink services.\n\nReports from late April and early May 2025 provide context on Starlink's expansion in the region. Bangladesh's telecommunication regulator granted Starlink two 10-year operating licenses, making it the second South Asian country after Sri Lanka to approve the service. Officials indicated that Starlink was preparing to launch service in Bangladesh by May 2025. In contrast, Starlink's full license in Pakistan is delayed pending permanent registration and the clearance of technical and security checks.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Sri Lanka is not yet shown as Available on Starlink’s map, and government sign-off appears incomplete.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations over lawful interception and the required TRCSL dashboard integration drag on into July or later; the government maintains a hold pending security/compliance assurances, so Starlink keeps Sri Lanka as Coming Soon/Regulatory Approval Pending rather than Available.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "TRCSL and the Defence Ministry finalize lawful-intercept and dashboard requirements, issue final operational clearance, and Starlink flips the map to Available for Sri Lanka and opens orders before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The resolution hinges on Starlink’s availability map showing Sri Lanka as Available before July 1, 2025. The research assistant notes: (1) Sri Lanka granted a Starlink license in Aug 2024; (2) as of late March 2025, TRCSL denied suspension rumors but said a regulatory dashboard was required and expected operations in April once systems were ready; (3) a parallel report (Mar 23) said the government put service on hold pending guarantees for lawful interception, with talks still preliminary; (4) tariff plans have been approved; (5) Bangladesh is moving to launch in May 2025, while Pakistan faces delays.\n\nWeighing these: Approval of tariffs and TRCSL’s statement that operations were expected in April suggest readiness and momentum. However, the government’s explicit requirement for lawful intercept and the mention that discussions were still at a preliminary stage introduce meaningful execution risk. Lawful-intercept compliance and integration of monitoring/dashboard systems can be non-trivial and often take longer than expected. Given it is now mid-May without visible confirmation that Sri Lanka is live, the status quo leans No. That said, the remaining ~6 weeks is enough time if regulatory sign-off is close; Starlink can update the map quickly once clearance is granted.\n\nWhy not higher: The security/LI hold is a known, material gating factor; conflicting official messages (\"expected in April\" vs. \"still preliminary\") suggest slippage. These kinds of compliance integrations frequently overrun timelines, especially where multiple ministries are involved. If the hold persists even a few more weeks, the window to switch the map to Available before July 1 becomes tight.\n\nWhy not lower: Sri Lanka already granted the license and approved tariffs; TRCSL publicly indicated operational readiness pending systems. Regional momentum (Bangladesh) shows Starlink is actively turning on service in South Asia. If the intercept/dashboard issue is near resolution, a rapid flip to Available is plausible within the time left.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports that TRCSL/Defence have finalized lawful-intercept agreements, that the dashboard is live, or that user terminals are being ordered/activated in Sri Lanka; any Starlink communication listing a near-term go-live date or the map briefly showing Waitlist/Available indicators.\n\nWhat would move me down: New statements extending the hold, legal or policy disputes about interception, or signs that Starlink and the government remain far apart on technical/security requirements.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
