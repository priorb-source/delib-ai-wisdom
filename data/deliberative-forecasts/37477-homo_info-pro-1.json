    "review": "My initial analysis, and that of Forecaster 2, correctly identified the low statistical bar for a 'Yes' resolution: only one day in a 23-day period is needed where both papers omit the word. We both concluded this made a 'Yes' outcome likely. However, Forecaster 3 introduced a critical piece of evidence I had not considered: a new, sweeping 'minimum benchmark tariff' of 10% was levied on all trade partners on April 2, 2025, just over a month ago. This is not a background political debate; it is a massive, ongoing, and disruptive economic event. Forecaster 3's reasoning that this specific event has the magnitude and multifaceted impact to guarantee sustained front-page coverage in both the nation's premier business paper (WSJ) and its premier political paper of record (NYT) is extremely convincing. This new context fundamentally weakens my original statistical argument by suggesting the daily probability of the story's appearance is far higher than I initially assumed.",
    "rationale": "I am significantly updating my forecast downward based on the new information provided by Forecaster 3. The recent implementation of a universal 10% tariff is a story of exceptional gravity and longevity. Its consequences—on markets, diplomacy, consumer prices, and corporate earnings—generate a continuous stream of new, front-page-worthy developments. This makes it highly probable that the story will have a daily presence on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, and almost as probable for The New York Times.\n\nMy previous forecast of 75% was based on the volatility of the news cycle and the unlikelihood of any single topic maintaining prominence for 23 straight days. That general heuristic fails when faced with a story of this specific magnitude. The bar for a 'Yes' resolution now appears much higher; it would likely require a 'black swan' event—a major natural disaster, a new war, or a significant domestic crisis—to completely eclipse the tariff story on both front pages simultaneously. While such an event is possible within a three-week window, it is not the most likely outcome. The status quo is now a 'No'. I am lowering my forecast from 75% to 15%, aligning closely with Forecaster 3's assessment of the story's profound newsworthiness while still acknowledging the inherent unpredictability of a 23-day news cycle.",
