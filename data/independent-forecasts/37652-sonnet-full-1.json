  "information": "Following his election win on April 28, 2025, Prime Minister Mark Carney presented a new, smaller cabinet of 29 ministers, down from 39 in the previous administration. Key figures such as François-Philippe Champagne (Finance) and Dominic LeBlanc (US Trade) were retained. Carney's government announced it would not table a full federal budget before the summer, opting for a fall economic statement instead. The new administration's immediate promises include a tax cut and the elimination of all inter-provincial trade barriers by July 1. Carney signed a symbolic decree to lower the first taxable income bracket from 15% to 14%, a measure requiring parliamentary approval. The Liberal party's platform includes additional spending that projects the national deficit for 2025-26 to be $62.3 billion Canadian dollars, an increase from the $42.2 billion forecast in December.\n\nThe relationship with the United States under President Donald Trump was a central theme of the recent Canadian election. Trump had made public remarks about absorbing Canada into the U.S. and imposed tariffs on Canadian goods. In response, Prime Minister Carney stated his government would 'relentlessly' protect Canadian sovereignty and work to define a new economic and security relationship with Washington. After the election, Carney met with Trump but did not secure a removal of the U.S. tariffs. Carney has stated he will maintain Canadian tariffs on U.S. products as long as American tariffs remain in place. The new Canadian cabinet has been explicitly tasked with focusing on Canada-U.S. relations and resolving trade disputes.\n\nPolling data from the period leading up to the April 28, 2025, snap election showed a significant shift in public opinion. After trailing by more than 20 points at the start of the year, the Liberal party under Mark Carney experienced a major comeback. A March 23 Ipsos poll reported Carney's approval rating at 48% with 30% disapproval, while Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre had 35% approval and 52% disapproval. Some outlets cited the same poll as showing Carney with a 71% approval rating. An Abacus Data poll from March 24 found the Conservatives with a national lead of 39% to 36% over the Liberals, but found Carney was the preferred choice for Prime Minister over Poilievre, 38% to 34%. The same poll reported that 77% of Canadians held a negative view of U.S. President Donald Trump.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6.5 weeks until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Carney likely has higher approval than Trump",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Carney's honeymoon period ends quickly as economic challenges mount, the tariff dispute with the US damages his standing, and the projected $62.3 billion deficit becomes a political liability. Meanwhile, Trump experiences a boost in US approval due to positive economic or foreign policy developments, causing his approval to rise above or equal to Carney's.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Carney maintains his post-election honeymoon period through July 1, benefiting from the symbolic tax cut decree and progress toward eliminating inter-provincial trade barriers. Trump's approval remains at typical levels (low-to-mid 40s) while Carney's stays elevated in the high 40s to low 50s range, common for newly elected leaders.",
    "rationale": "Mark Carney is in a very favorable position for this question. He won his election just 17 days ago (April 28) and is currently experiencing a typical honeymoon period that new leaders enjoy. The March polling showed him at 48% approval before his election victory, and election wins typically boost approval further. The 77% negative Canadian view of Trump from March suggests strong domestic sentiment against the US president.\n\nTrump's approval ratings in the US historically range from the high 30s to mid-40s based on his previous term and early 2025 polling patterns. Morning Consult's methodology tracks adults in each country separately, so we're comparing Carney's approval among Canadians to Trump's approval among Americans.\n\nThe status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome because: (1) Carney just won an election, (2) he's in his honeymoon period, (3) only 6.5 weeks remain until resolution, which is insufficient time for major approval rating shifts absent major crises, and (4) Trump's baseline approval tends to be lower than what new leaders experience.\n\nHowever, my forecast is not higher because: Carney faces real challenges with the US tariff situation (he didn't secure their removal), the projected deficit increase could become controversial, and no full budget will be presented before summer. Honeymoon periods can end abruptly if major problems emerge.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because: Six weeks is a short timeframe for dramatic shifts, Carney's recent election victory provides momentum, and Trump's approval ceiling is historically constrained in the low-to-mid 40s.\n\nI would update higher if: Morning Consult data from late May/early June shows Carney maintaining strong approval above 50% while Trump remains below 45%. I would update lower if: Carney's approval drops quickly due to economic concerns or Trump experiences an unexpected approval surge.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney have a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mark Carney has a higher approval rating than US President Donald Trump according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
