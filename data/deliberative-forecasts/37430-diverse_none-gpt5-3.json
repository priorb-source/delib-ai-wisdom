    "review": "Forecaster 2 usefully emphasizes the executive sponsorship and political appeal of a housing-affordability measure, which can materially increase the odds of fast-tracking. However, they don’t point to concrete procedural signals (e.g., committee reports scheduled, one chamber passage, leadership fast-track commitments) that would justify being above 60% with fewer than two months left and a potentially bundled tax package. Forecaster 3’s analysis closely matches my prior view: the tight timeline, multi-stage process, and lack of stage-specific intel are strong headwinds. I find F3’s base-rate framing convincing; F2’s case raises the upside but lacks evidence of imminent movement.\n",
    "rationale": "I previously sat at 37%, driven by the short runway, the two-chamber/assent requirements, and the bundling risk within a broader tax reform bill. Forecaster 2’s argument nudges me slightly upward: executive-backed, politically attractive items can move quickly in Nigeria when prioritized. That said, without signs of actual acceleration (e.g., passage in one chamber in May, concurrent consideration, or public commitments to enactment before July 1), the default friction still dominates. I therefore make a small upward adjustment, but remain below 50% due to the procedural and timing risks and the possibility that the measure slips into a later finance package.\n",
