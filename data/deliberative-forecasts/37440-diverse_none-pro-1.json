    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identify that the legislative calendar is the primary obstacle, with Florida's regular session likely concluded. My initial forecast was 20%, while the other two landed at 30%. I found Forecaster 3's analysis particularly insightful. They introduced crucial points I had not sufficiently weighed: the potential for legal challenges under the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), the operational complexity of implementing such a system, and the narrowness of the resolution criteria, which requires that voters themselves provide proof, not just that the state perform backend checks. These arguments significantly strengthen the case for a 'No' outcome. While both other forecasters arrived at 30%, plausibly by giving more weight to the sheer political will of Florida's Republican leadership to push such legislation, I believe the specific, concrete obstacles raised by Forecaster 3 make enactment less likely than my initial estimate.",
    "rationale": "My reasoning has been updated based on the points raised during deliberation, particularly by Forecaster 3. The primary barrier to a 'Yes' outcome remains the legislative timeline; as of May 6, 2025, the regular session has likely ended, meaning a special session would be required before the July 1 deadline. While I initially accounted for this, I am now lowering my forecast because of additional, significant hurdles. First, the threat of immediate and costly legal challenges under the NVRA, as seen in other states, could create hesitation even within a motivated legislature. Second, the operational burden of creating a system for voters to provide documentary proof is non-trivial and may cause such a provision to be stripped from a bill during last-minute negotiations. Finally, the resolution's strict requirement for voter-provided proof means that a more politically palatable bill focused only on state-run database checks would not cause a 'Yes' resolution. These factors, combined with the primary obstacle of the legislative calendar, make the status quo the most probable outcome. I am therefore reducing my forecast from 20% to 15%.",
