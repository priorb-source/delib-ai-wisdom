    "review": "Both forecasters frame the core tension correctly: extreme troughs tend to mean-revert, but pessimism can persist if underlying drivers remain. Forecaster 2’s case is stronger: they emphasize how little improvement is required (any tick above 50.8) and the likelihood of a modest bounce given typical month-to-month volatility. Forecaster 3 likely over-weights structural persistence without concrete evidence; the 2022 episode actually saw a bounce the month after the all-time low (June->July), which slightly favors mean reversion rather than multi-month stasis at the floor. Neither explicitly highlights measurement/sampling variability in the preliminary print or the low probability of an exact repeat at 50.8, both of which tilt modestly toward Yes. That said, their caution about continued negative drivers (inflation, rates, energy, geopolitics, Fed tone) is valid and argues against very high confidence.",
    "rationale": "My base case remains that a reading as low as 50.8 is more likely to be followed by a small rebound than a further decline or perfect flat print, given: (1) regression to the mean from an extreme, (2) typical month-to-month noise in the preliminary Michigan series that can easily move >0.1 point, and (3) the low bar for a Yes outcome. I modestly temper my prior 65% to account for persistence risk and event risk between now and the early-May field period (Apr 30 FOMC tone, late-April/early-May market and energy price dynamics). Overall, the balance still favors a slight uptick, but with meaningful downside risk if the same negative narratives dominate respondents during the survey window.",
