    "review": "Forecaster 2 and I largely share the same core drivers (licenses granted, strong political support, no gateway dependency), but they weight momentum more heavily. Forecaster 3 adds a valuable emphasis on the calendar math: the window from the Apr 30 license to the Jul 1 deadline is essentially two months, leaving very little buffer for tariff approval and go‑live steps. I didn’t explicitly foreground that tight boundary in my first pass. I also agree with Forecaster 3 that the publicly floated May launch target slipping into mid‑May without visible tariff approval or order-page readiness is a weak negative signal. Neither added decisive new facts, but the timing discipline in Forecaster 3’s argument nudges me slightly downward. Forecaster 2’s political-risk assessment (US probe as mostly optics) matches mine, but I think they underweight the risk that tariff approval plus payments/VAT setup could spill past June.",
    "rationale": "Key positives remain: two 10‑year licenses issued on Apr 30; a public April trial; explicit government enthusiasm; and technical feasibility via ISLs without a local gateway. These support a relatively fast path. The critical path is tariff/price approval and flipping the order page live, which historically can take weeks even with political support. With ~45 days left, even a modest bureaucratic or commercial integration delay (tariff review, VAT/BDT billing, distribution) could push availability past July 1. The US Senate probe is unlikely to directly affect BTRC in the near term, but it may make SpaceX more cautious about optics and sequencing. Netting these, I still see odds above even due to licenses-in-hand and stated near-term intent, but I trim down slightly to reflect the very tight calendar and lack of visible tariff approval by mid‑May.",
