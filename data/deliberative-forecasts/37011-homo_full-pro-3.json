    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental drivers of this question. We all identified the same immense structural barriers for Reform UK: the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) system, the massive Conservative incumbency (notionally 57 of 64 seats), Reform's lack of local party machinery, and the historical failure of similar insurgent parties to win control of councils. The analyses are all very convincing because they are grounded in the same core evidence. The only difference is a minor one of calibration between a 1% and 2% forecast. Forecaster 3 made a particularly sharp point that a high Reform vote share is more likely to split the conservative vote and allow Labour to win seats, rather than leading to a Reform victory. This adds a crucial layer of complexity that strengthens the 'No' case.",
    "rationale": "My initial reasoning remains the same, but the deliberation has convinced me to refine my forecast downwards. The analyses from the other forecasters strongly reinforced the scale of the challenge facing Reform. I found Forecaster 3's argument—that a strong Reform performance is very likely to split the right-wing vote and elect Labour candidates in three-way contests—particularly compelling. This makes Reform's path to victory even narrower. They don't just need a massive, direct swing from the Conservatives; they need that swing to be incredibly efficient, winning pluralities against both the remaining Conservative vote and a potentially strengthened Labour vote. This added complexity makes an already extremely unlikely event even more so. The consensus view that this would be an historically unprecedented outcome solidifies my belief that a lower probability is more appropriate. Therefore, I am updating my forecast from 2% down to 1%.",
