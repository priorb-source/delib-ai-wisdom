    "review": "New, useful points from the others: (1) Colorado’s all‑mail system likely boosts turnout even in a small off‑cycle recall; that can blunt the pure “motivated minority wins” effect. (2) Concrete details that Metz pleaded not guilty to felony charges and took a leave of absence—salient negatives that I had not explicitly cited. (3) The electorate is extremely small (on the order of a few hundred active voters), heightening variance. I’m less convinced by Forecaster 3’s starting point of >50% for retention; for recalls that qualify for the ballot, base rates favor removal, and the triggering incident here is unusually severe. Forecaster 2’s framing aligns with my prior: serious allegation, unresolved case, and signature success imply an energized opposition; mail ballots add turnout but don’t obviously rescue the incumbent absent strong endorsements or visible GOTV.",
    "rationale": "Time to election is ~8 days. Base rate: about 40% retention for officials who make a recall ballot. Case specifics push below that: the incident’s severity (accused of shooting a teen in the face), unresolved felony case, ongoing negative coverage, and a leave of absence all suggest opponents are more motivated and have already demonstrated organizational capacity. Mountain View’s tiny electorate means volatility is high, but small‑town networks cut both ways; without credible pro‑Metz endorsements or signs of a strong field effort, the default favors removal. Colorado’s mail‑ballot process likely lifts turnout relative to a typical special, modestly reducing the advantage of a small, highly motivated faction—but in a controversy this emotive, higher turnout plausibly helps recall proponents as well. Balancing these, I edge slightly down from my prior 32% to 31% to reflect the added negative details (felony charges, leave of absence), with the mail‑ballot point preventing a larger downward move. Upside movers before E‑Day would be visible endorsements for Metz, evidence of coordinated GOTV, or legal/news developments credibly supporting his account. Downside movers would be new damaging revelations or clear signs of broad community mobilization against him.",
