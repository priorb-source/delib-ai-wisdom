    "review": "The other forecasters' analyses are thorough and converge remarkably on 14-15%. They raise several important points I should weigh more heavily:\n\n1. **Benin's escalation, not de-escalation**: Forecaster 3 correctly emphasizes that Benin extended security operations to additional border areas (Sèmè/Owode) on May 9. I noted this but didn't give it enough weight. This signals broadening concern rather than movement toward resolution - a negative indicator I undervalued.\n\n2. **Timeframe precision**: The closure-to-deadline window is approximately 53 days, which is shorter than the 60-day base rate window of 20%. This supports adjusting below that baseline.\n\n3. **Consensus signal**: Three independent forecasters using similar methodologies arrived at 14-18%. This convergence itself is informative - it suggests the evidence genuinely points to this range rather than any single forecaster having an idiosyncratic view.\n\n4. **Absence of positive signals**: All three analyses note zero credible reporting of progress toward reopening in the 23-25 days since closure. This is significant.\n\nForecaster 2's point about adjusting below the 20% base rate due to the compressed timeframe is well-taken. Forecaster 3's emphasis on recent escalatory actions (extending measures to other borders) as indicating caution rather than relaxation is particularly compelling evidence I underweighted.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should adjust my forecast downward moderately. The key factor I underweighted is Benin's May 9 extension of border security operations to additional areas (Sèmè/Owode in Lagos State). This action occurred just days after the Kwara closure and signals that Benin views the security concerns as serious and potentially widespread, not as a localized issue amenable to quick resolution. This is escalatory behavior inconsistent with imminent reopening.\n\nCombined with: (1) the May 30 AFRICOM briefing noting deteriorating conditions - the most recent credible signal; (2) zero public indications of diplomatic breakthroughs in 25 days; (3) the compressed 53-day total window being shorter than the 60-day base rate period; and (4) the gravity of stated concerns (terrorism, arms smuggling) requiring substantial security arrangements before reopening, the evidence supports a probability in the 15-16% range.\n\nI maintain slightly above the 14-15% consensus because: diplomatic processes can occasionally produce rapid results under sufficient pressure; ECOWAS has mediation mechanisms that could accelerate resolution; and the economic pain to border communities creates genuine urgency. However, the lack of any positive movement and Benin's escalatory actions justify moving down from my initial 18%.",
