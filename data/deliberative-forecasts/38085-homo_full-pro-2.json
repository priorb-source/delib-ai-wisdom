    "review": "My initial forecast and those of the other two forecasters all correctly identified the core tension of this question: the severe, existing drought's inertia versus the potential for rapid change brought on by the start of Florida's rainy and hurricane seasons. We all anchored on the status quo of 14.5 million residents in drought, which is 500,000 above the resolution threshold. The primary difference in our forecasts (80%, 75%, and 65%) stems from how we weighed this 500,000-person buffer. I found Forecaster 3's characterization of this as a 'relatively close' margin to be the most insightful point I had initially under-weighed. Their argument that a moderate improvement affecting a small percentage of the state's population could flip the outcome is very convincing and highlights the forecast's sensitivity to a single large weather event.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward from 80% to 75%. My initial reasoning was heavily weighted on the inertia of the severe drought, which I still believe is the most probable driver of the outcome. However, the deliberation highlighted that my confidence may have been too high. Forecaster 3's argument about the fragility of the 500,000-person buffer was particularly impactful. A single well-placed tropical system or a series of strong, widespread thunderstorms—events that are more likely during a predicted above-average hurricane season—could plausibly bring relief to that number of people within the one-month timeframe. Adjusting to 75% better incorporates this heightened uncertainty and the possibility of a rapid reversal, aligning my forecast more closely with Forecaster 2's. I am not lowering my forecast further to 65% because I believe the specific NOAA forecast predicting the *persistence* of drought in South Florida through June is a very strong piece of evidence that suggests the status quo is more likely than not to hold.",
