    "review": "Both forecasters make compelling arguments that align closely with my analysis, with all three of us converging in the 78-87% range. Forecaster 3 raises the most important new consideration I underweighted: the seasonal timing. We're entering California's dry season (June-September) rather than the wet season (November-March), and Forecaster 2 reinforces this by noting June is historically one of California's driest months. This is a crucial factor that significantly reduces the likelihood of natural drought improvement. Both forecasters also emphasize more strongly than I did how slowly drought classifications change - requiring sustained precipitation over weeks or months, not just isolated events. The tropical storm potential I mentioned would need to deliver exceptional and widespread rainfall to reverse drought conditions for 2.7 million residents in just 30 days during the dry season, which seems increasingly unlikely when framed this way. All three of us identify the same core facts: 22.7M currently affected, 2.7M buffer above threshold, NOAA forecasts persistence through August, only 30 days remaining. The disagreement is primarily about how much weight to give weather uncertainty versus seasonal patterns and official forecasts.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating my forecast upward. The seasonal timing argument is particularly persuasive - entering the dry season makes dramatic drought improvement through natural precipitation patterns highly unlikely within 30 days. June is historically California's driest month, and NOAA's explicit forecast for drought persistence through August directly encompasses our June 28 resolution date. The 2.7M resident buffer (13.5% above threshold) provides substantial cushion. While I maintain some caution about weather unpredictability and the possibility of unexpected rainfall from systems like Tropical Storm Alvin, the combination of: (1) strong seasonal dry patterns, (2) explicit expert forecasts predicting persistence, (3) significant buffer above threshold, (4) very short timeframe for meaningful improvement, and (5) slow-changing nature of drought classifications all point to a higher probability than my initial 82%. I'm not going as high as 87% because weather systems do introduce genuine uncertainty and one or two significant precipitation events could provide modest improvement, but the seasonal context makes this less likely than I initially assessed.",
