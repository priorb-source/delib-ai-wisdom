  "information": "Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and Palestinian activist, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March 2025. An immigration judge subsequently ruled that he can be deported, concluding that the government had met its burden to prove grounds for deportation based on national security and foreign policy concerns. Khalil's legal team is appealing this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and has also filed a separate habeas corpus petition in federal court, arguing that the government's actions violate his First Amendment rights.\n\nOn May 11, 2025, a federal judge in New Jersey extended a temporary restraining order (TRO) that bars ICE from deporting Mahmoud Khalil. The extension was granted because the court found Khalil’s First-Amendment and Administrative Procedure Act claims to be “plausible.” Further legal briefings have been scheduled, and TROs that are extended typically remain in effect until a court rules on a motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nThe case occurs within a broader context of the Trump administration's actions against individuals involved in pro-Palestinian activism. Reports indicate that since January 2025, the administration has revoked visas for over 1,000 foreign university students. Additionally, the Zionist organization Betar US announced it is working with the administration to help deport demonstrators it considers a threat, and has publicly named Mahmoud Khalil in its statements. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has also written that allowing Khalil to remain in the country would create a “hostile environment for Jewish students.”",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months, as the question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Mahmoud Khalil remains in the United States under ICE detention, but is legally protected from deportation by an extended Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) issued by a federal court while his legal challenges proceed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The federal court's TRO remains in effect or is converted into a preliminary injunction, preventing deportation while the case is litigated. The judicial process, including the appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals and the federal habeas corpus petition, extends beyond the July 1, 2025 deadline, as is typical for such cases.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The federal court rapidly denies a preliminary injunction and dissolves the TRO. The Board of Immigration Appeals expedites its process and denies his appeal. This creates a narrow legal window for the executive branch, acting under significant political pressure, to execute the deportation order before the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on the timeline relative to the typical speed of the U.S. judicial system. The single most important factor is the extended Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) from a federal judge, which explicitly bars ICE from deporting Mahmoud Khalil. The judge's finding that Khalil's First Amendment claims are 'plausible' suggests the court is taking the case seriously and is unlikely to rush to a decision that would allow for his removal. Legal proceedings involving federal courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) are notoriously slow, with appeals often taking many months, if not years. The deadline of July 1, 2025, is less than two months away, making it highly improbable that all of Khalil's legal avenues for appeal and review would be exhausted and ruled against him in such a short period. The status quo is that he is legally protected from deportation, and changing that status requires clearing significant judicial hurdles. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 10% because of the immense political will for his deportation, as evidenced by the actions of the Trump administration, statements from the Secretary of State, and pressure from outside groups. The executive branch has significant resources and may attempt to expedite the process or act decisively if a legal window, however brief, opens up. \n\nMy probability is not higher than 10% because the judicial branch operates as a significant check on executive power. The existence of the TRO is a strong signal that the court will not simply rubber-stamp the executive's wishes, especially when plausible constitutional claims are at stake. The timeline is the government's biggest enemy here. \n\nI would increase my forecast for a 'Yes' outcome if the federal court quickly dissolves the TRO and denies a preliminary injunction. I would decrease my forecast if the court grants a preliminary injunction or if the deadline approaches with the TRO still in place.",
