  "information": "Libya's Economy and Trade Minister, Muhammed Huveyc, announced in May 2025 that the country aims to increase its trade volume with Turkey from $3.7 billion to $10 billion. To facilitate this, joint committees have been established to address issues such as the return of Turkish companies to projects in Libya and the resolution of bank guarantees. The two countries are also working towards eliminating taxes and establishing a free trade zone, with the stated goal of using Libya's strategic location to facilitate the transport of Turkish industrial products to the broader African market.\n\nAs of late April 2025, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) has achieved a 92% consensus on trade rules. Forty-nine of the 54 African countries have joined the agreement, with 23 having commenced implementation of the new trade rules. Supporting infrastructure includes the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), which now connects over 20 central banks and 160 commercial banks, enabling easier payment for goods in local currencies. Additionally, Afreximbank is organizing specialized training programs to help African businesses understand the AfCFTA's commercial implications and regulatory landscape.\n\nImplementation of the AfCFTA faces several challenges. Six years after its inception, key decisions regarding tariff liberalization and rules of origin remain pending for a number of state parties. Some countries, including South Africa, have not yet submitted full tariff offers for sensitive goods, pending the finalization of rules of origin for key sectors such as automotive and textiles. The deadline for finalizing these rules is October 2025. The overall target for the removal of tariffs on 90% of goods has been moved back to 2034. Some analysts note that production-related challenges, like low industrial output and poor infrastructure, must be addressed before the full benefits of tariff removal can be realized.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months (from May 1, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Libya does not ratify AfCFTA before the deadline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Libya continues focusing on bilateral trade agreements (such as the Turkey partnership announced in May 2025) and does not complete the ratification process for AfCFTA within the remaining two months due to complex domestic political dynamics and lack of immediate urgency",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Libya's government rapidly prioritizes AfCFTA ratification as part of its strategy to position the country as a trade hub between Turkey and Africa, expediting the necessary governmental approvals and completing ratification within the two-month window",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors NO for several reasons. First, the timeframe is extremely short - only 2 months remain until the July 1 deadline. Ratification processes typically require parliamentary approval and various bureaucratic steps that are difficult to complete so quickly, especially in Libya's complex political environment with ongoing institutional fragmentation. Second, the fact that this question is being asked implies Libya has not yet ratified (otherwise it would be resolved). With 49 of 54 African countries having joined AfCFTA, Libya appears to be among the holdouts. Third, while the research assistant's report mentions Libya's May 2025 trade ambitions with Turkey and using Libya as a gateway to African markets, there is no mention of any active plans or timeline for AfCFTA ratification. The focus appears to be on bilateral arrangements rather than multilateral frameworks. Fourth, Libya's political instability and divided governance structures make rapid policy implementation challenging. The only factor supporting a YES outcome is Libya's stated interest in serving as a trade conduit to Africa, which AfCFTA membership could facilitate. However, this strategic interest hasn't translated into concrete ratification action despite AfCFTA being operational since 2021. For me to update higher, I would need evidence of: (1) Libya formally submitting ratification documents or announcing imminent ratification plans, (2) acceleration of political consensus within Libya on this issue, or (3) external pressure or incentives creating urgency. For me to update lower from an already low probability, I would need confirmation that Libya has explicitly stated it will not ratify in 2025 or evidence of major political obstacles.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
