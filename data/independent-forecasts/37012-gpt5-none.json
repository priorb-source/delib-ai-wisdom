    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Roughly 10–14 days (vote on 2025-05-01; results likely by 2025-05-02 or 05-03)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Conservatives currently hold the most seats on West Northamptonshire Council and would remain largest if nothing changed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A strong anti-Conservative swing centered in Northampton town delivers Labour a plurality of seats, aided by tactical voting and Lib Dem/Green gains in parts of South Northamptonshire and Daventry. Even a tie for most seats would count as No because Conservatives would not control the most seats outright.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Conservatives lose many seats but retain enough rural and small-town wards in Daventry and South Northamptonshire, while splits among Labour/Lib Dem/Green/Reform in Northampton prevent Labour from surpassing them. They finish as the largest single party, even if short of a majority.",
    "rationale": "Timing: We are about 1–2 weeks from the election; results should be known within a day or two of voting.\n\nBaseline: In the 2021 inaugural election for West Northamptonshire, Conservatives won a large majority and have been the largest party since. The status quo therefore favors a Conservative plurality absent major shifts.\n\nWhy the base case is at risk: National conditions are highly unfavorable for the Conservatives (Labour polling ~20+ points ahead nationally as of April 2025). Local elections over the past two cycles have produced heavy Conservative losses, with Reform siphoning right-leaning votes and tactical voting boosting Labour/Lib Dems. West Northamptonshire’s geography matters: Northampton town likely accounts for a large share of seats and is much more Labour-leaning than the rural hinterland. If Labour dominates multi-member wards in Northampton and the Lib Dems pick up pockets in South Northants, Conservatives can easily be knocked into second place on total seats even if they remain competitive across rural wards.\n\nWhy Conservatives could still be largest: Rural and small-town wards in Daventry and South Northamptonshire remain structurally Conservative, and multi-member FPTP can still yield 2–1 or even 3–0 Conservative slates in those areas. Opposition vote splits (Labour vs Lib Dem vs Green) plus Reform’s presence can allow Conservatives to top the field in enough wards to remain the largest party even if they lose their majority. Turnout patterns in local elections also tend to favor Conservatives in rural wards.\n\nNet assessment: I lean slightly toward No (i.e., Conservatives not being the largest) because the national swing is severe, Labour is likely to sweep many Northampton wards, and any Lib Dem growth in the south further erodes the Conservative seat tally. However, the rural cushion and opposition fragmentation keep the probability of a Conservative plurality meaningfully high.\n\nWhy not higher: Very poor national environment for Conservatives; urban-heavy seat distribution likely amplifies Labour gains; Reform may split the right; first re-election since 2021 creates maximum vulnerability.\n\nWhy not lower: Conservatives start from a dominant seat base; rural wards provide a durable floor; multi-member contests and opposition splits can preserve a Conservative plurality even with large vote share losses.\n\nWhat would move me up: Evidence of limited Reform candidacies, strong Conservative incumbency/campaign in key rural wards, credible ward-level data showing split opposition slates, or reliable local previews indicating Conservatives remain ahead in Daventry/South Northants while competitive in parts of Northampton.\n\nWhat would move me down: Robust ward-level canvass data or credible forecasts showing Labour sweeping most Northampton wards, stronger-than-expected Lib Dem targeting in South Northants/Daventry, or reports of high Reform coverage in Conservative-leaning wards.\n\nResearch assistant input: No additional information provided beyond the BBC link; assessment relies on known national trends, local geography, and the 2021 baseline.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
