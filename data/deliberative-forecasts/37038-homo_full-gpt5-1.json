    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my read: the +17% line exists now under 9903.01.48, the suspension runs past June 1, and resolution counts a suspended listing as Yes. They correctly note that reversing this before June 1 would require a new proclamation and fast HTS update, which is possible but not the default. Forecaster 3 emphasizes the plausibility of a quick bilateral deal and rapid USITC updates; that’s a valid downside, but not new information beyond what I already considered. Neither adds concrete signals of imminent rescission or procedural scheduling that would materially change odds now.",
    "rationale": "- Status quo favors Yes: The +17% entry is already in the HTS and is suspended until July 9. With no action, it will still be listed on June 1, which is sufficient for a Yes.\n- Path to No: A finalized US–Israel deal promptly followed by a Presidential Proclamation and HTS revision that removes or alters 9903.01.48 before June 1. This is feasible but requires both political agreement and quick procedural execution.\n- Inertia and leverage: Because duties are suspended, there is little operational pressure to remove the listing prior to July 9, and maintaining it preserves negotiating leverage. Historically, Chapter 99 entries tied to ongoing talks are often left in place until the decision point.\n- Update decision: I don’t see new evidence that accelerates removal before June 1 (e.g., a scheduled proclamation, Federal Register notice, or USITC preview). The additional deliberation reiterates existing risks without adding fresh indicators. Therefore, I’m holding my estimate.\n- What would change my view: A joint announcement of a finalized deal with an effective rescission date in May; a Presidential Proclamation or Federal Register notice specifying HTS changes effective before June 1; or visible USITC staging of revisions removing the +17% line. Conversely, signals from USTR/USITC that no changes are planned before July would push me higher.",
