  "information": "The U.S. State Department's travel advisory for Mozambique is currently 'Level 3: Reconsider Travel,' as of the last update on December 19, 2023. Specific northern regions of the country are under higher-level warnings. Recent security developments include suspected jihadist attacks in late April and early May 2025 in Niassa province, an area previously less impacted by the insurgency centered in Cabo Delgado. In response, the U.S. Embassy in Maputo issued specific warnings. The UK and Canada have also warned against travel to parts of Niassa and Cabo Delgado. Concurrently, ongoing post-election protests have led the African Travel & Tourism Association (ATTA) to issue its own travel advisory.\n\nThe U.S. State Department uses a four-level travel advisory system. Level 1 is 'Exercise Normal Precautions.' Level 2 is 'Exercise Increased Caution,' for heightened safety and security risks. Level 3, 'Reconsider Travel,' signifies serious risks. Level 4, 'Do Not Travel,' is the highest level, typically applied in cases of widespread violent conflict, civil war, uncontrolled crime, risk of wrongful detention, or severe breakdowns in national infrastructure. The advisories are determined based on factors including crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and health concerns. The State Department reviews advisories for Level 3 and 4 countries at least every six months.\n\nAs of early May 2025, the U.S. State Department has 'Level 4: Do Not Travel' advisories in effect for 21 countries. Reasons for these advisories include active conflicts, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and health emergencies. The list of countries includes Afghanistan, Belarus, Burkina Faso, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen. Some advisories have been updated recently; the advisory for South Sudan was elevated to Level 4 on March 8, 2025. In other instances, advisories are applied regionally, such as in Bangladesh, which has a country-wide Level 3 advisory but a Level 4 warning for the Chittagong Hill Tracts region.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Mozambique remains at Level 3: Reconsider Travel, with specific northern areas (e.g., Cabo Delgado, possibly parts of Niassa) flagged as Do Not Travel regionally.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Insurgent activity remains largely confined to northern provinces with intermittent attacks; protests stay localized and manageable; the U.S. Embassy continues issuing regional/security alerts without ordering departure; State keeps country-level advisory at Level 3 with area-specific Level 4 warnings.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp security deterioration: sustained or high-casualty attacks spread beyond Cabo Delgado into provincial capitals or key corridors; a major incident targeting foreigners or critical energy assets; significant nationwide unrest or an Embassy ordered/authorized departure. State elevates the overall country advisory to Level 4.",
    "rationale": "Starting point: Mozambique is currently Level 3 (Reconsider Travel). The State Department typically reserves Level 4 for countries with widespread conflict, severe civil unrest, regime hostility/wrongful detention risks, or major breakdowns in state capacity. Many Level 4 countries (e.g., Afghanistan, Sudan, Yemen, Haiti) exhibit far more pervasive risk than Mozambique, where insecurity is geographically concentrated.\n\nRecent developments: According to the research assistant, suspected jihadist attacks occurred in late April/early May 2025 in Niassa province, prompting U.S. Embassy warnings, and the UK and Canada flagged parts of Niassa/Cabo Delgado. Concurrently, post-election protests led ATTA to issue an advisory. These are meaningful negatives but remain consistent with a pattern of localized insurgency and periodic unrest rather than nationwide collapse.\n\nBase rates and policy practice: The U.S. often handles countries with localized insurgencies by keeping the national level at 3 and placing specific provinces or districts at Level 4 (Do Not Travel). This mirrors approaches used for Nigeria, DRC, Kenya, and others. Upgrading an entire country from 3 to 4 within two months typically requires a major shock (e.g., sudden war escalation, mass-casualty attacks in multiple regions, Embassy drawdown/ordered departure, or systematic targeting of foreigners). While the insurgency’s footprint shifting into Niassa is concerning, it does not by itself imply countrywide conditions warranting Level 4.\n\nTime horizon: About 8–9 weeks. That short window lowers the probability of the kind of nationwide deterioration usually needed for Level 4. The State Department can update at any time, but their six-month review cadence for higher levels does not, by itself, imply an imminent elevation.\n\nWhy not higher: Most of Mozambique—especially the south and Maputo—remains relatively stable compared with Level 4 countries. The LNG corridor is sensitive, but there’s no clear evidence of impending nationwide breakdown or Embassy-ordered departure.\n\nWhy not lower: There has been a recent uptick/spread of attacks into Niassa, ongoing unrest, and a history of volatility in Cabo Delgado. A large, high-profile incident or a sequence of attacks could still trigger a rapid reassessment.\n\nWhat would move me up: Multiple high-casualty attacks in quick succession in or near major urban centers (e.g., Pemba, Nampula), direct targeting of Westerners, kidnapping of U.S. citizens, attacks on critical energy assets, or an Embassy drawdown/ordered departure. Clear signs of security force loss of control across multiple provinces.\n\nWhat would move me down: A sustained lull in attacks, improved security operations in the north, absence of significant protest violence, and continued normal Embassy posture and messaging.",
