  "information": "According to the U.S. Department of Labor, initial jobless claims for the week ending May 31, 2025, rose by 8,000 to 247,000, the highest level in eight months. The figure for the prior week was revised to 239,000. The four-week moving average increased to 235,000, the highest since November 2021. For the week ending May 24, the number of continuing claims was 1.904 million, a slight decrease of 3,000 from the previous week.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 3 weeks until the data is released (expected June 27, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — recent weekly prints and the 4-week average are comfortably above 220,000",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Initial claims quickly revert lower as late-May distortions unwind, seasonal adjustments favor a dip, and prints for June 7 and June 14 come in near ~210–220k, setting up June 21 at or below 220k.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The softening trend persists: claims remain elevated in the mid‑230s to mid‑240s, possibly aided by seasonal factors (e.g., early-summer layoffs) and a high continuing-claims backdrop, keeping June 21 above 220k.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence/status quo: The latest reported initial jobless claims (week ended May 31) were 247k, with the prior week at 239k, and the 4‑week moving average at ~235k (per the research assistant). That average and recent prints suggest the underlying level is above 220k. Continuing claims around 1.9m indicate a cooler labor market than earlier in the cycle.\n- Base rate/volatility: Weekly claims are noisy, with typical week-to-week moves of ~5–10k. From a 4‑week average near 235k, getting to ≤220k in the June 21 week would require a sizable drop and favorable seasonal adjustment. It’s possible but not the base case.\n- Seasonality/timing: Early summer can see education-related and other seasonal shifts; while seasonal adjustment mitigates this, timing quirks can still keep readings elevated. Nothing obvious points to a sharp sub‑220k trough by June 21.\n- Why not higher: Weekly claims can mean-revert quickly; we’ve seen short-lived spikes reverse to low‑220s/high‑210s. If upcoming releases (June 7, June 14) print near 215–220k, the probability of ≤220k on June 21 would rise.\n- Why not lower: The latest hard data point (247k) and a 4‑week average around 235k argue the center of gravity is above 220k. Continuing claims remain high, consistent with a modestly softer labor market.\n- Updates that would move me: I’d move higher if the next one or two reports remain ≥230k with little sign of reversal. I’d move lower if we get one or two sub‑220k prints or strong indications that the late‑May jump was a transitory seasonal/payroll-processing blip.\n- Summary of assistant’s info used: Latest weekly claims rose to 247k (highest in 8 months) with the 4‑week average ~235k; continuing claims ~1.904m. These support a tilt toward a Yes outcome.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 exceed 220,000?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the resolution source, \"An initial claim is a claim filed by an unemployed individual after a separation from an employer. The claim requests a determination of basic eligibility for the Unemployment Insurance program.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if initial jobless claims for the week ended June 21, 2025 is greater than 220,000 according to [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ICSA).&#x20;\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Labor, initial jobless claims for the week ending May 31, 2025, rose by 8,000 to 247,000, the highest level in eight months.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
