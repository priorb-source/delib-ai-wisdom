    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the short two‑month window and Russia’s resource constraints, which I agree are the dominant factors. Forecaster 3 adds a useful nuance: the resolution only requires a U.S. accusation (not a large-scale operation), and there are plausible flashpoints where even limited ground movements could qualify (e.g., Transnistria/Moldova security zone or moves beyond ABLs in Georgia). That is the strongest argument for a slightly higher tail. However, I still think the U.S. tends to reserve “invasion” for clear-cut, substantial entries; smaller boundary incidents are more often labeled “incursions” or “violations.” Forecaster 2’s framing on overstretch and deterrents aligns closely with mine. I don’t see new evidence that would materially raise odds; the Moldova/Georgia scenarios remain conceivable but would likely show warning indicators, which we currently lack.",
    "rationale": "With ~2 months left, the base rate for a new Russian ground entry that Washington would label an “invasion” is extremely low. Russia is heavily committed in Ukraine; opening a new front risks military overstretch and wider confrontation, especially near NATO. The most plausible Yes path is Moldova via Transnistria or a push from occupied regions in Georgia—but both would likely produce detectable preparatory signals or rapid U.S./EU warnings, and the U.S. might still describe small-scale actions as incursions rather than an invasion. Given no new indicators, I maintain a very low probability. I would update up on credible reporting of Russian troop movements or airlift preparations tied to Transnistria, unusual activity in Abkhazia/South Ossetia, or U.S. intel warnings that specifically prime the term “invasion.” I would drift down as time elapses without such signals.",
