  "information": "According to reports from May 2025, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has achieved a 76% approval rating, making her the best-evaluated president since the 1994-2000 term. In specific areas, 63.4% of respondents positively evaluated her management of poverty reduction, and her administration's policies have been linked to a 24.9% reduction in homicides. However, on transparency and anti-corruption, 57.4% of respondents had a negative perception. Her administration has announced a $298 billion investment plan. Some polls cited her approval rating as high as 82%.\n\nA survey in Argentina conducted between April 28 and 30, 2025, by D'Alessio IROL/Berensztein indicated growing wear on Javier Milei's government. The survey showed his positive image has decreased to 44%, while his negative image has increased to 52%, for a net differential of -8%. 52% of respondents believe the economic situation is worse than the previous year. The evaluation of his government is divided, with 50% rating it as good and 48% as bad. Security Minister Patricia Bullrich has the highest positive image in the cabinet at 47%, as insecurity is the main social concern for 72% of respondents.\n\nAn international survey by Morning Consult conducted between January 21 and 27, 2025, placed Claudia Sheinbaum's approval rating at 66% and Javier Milei's at 65%. A later report from April 30, 2025, citing Morning Consult data, showed Milei's approval at 61% and Sheinbaum's at 60%. In the January survey, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had the highest approval rating at 75%.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~45 days (until June 28, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — Morning Consult most recent cited snapshot (Apr 30, 2025) had Milei 61% vs Sheinbaum 60%.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "By late June, Morning Consult shows Sheinbaum at, say, 62–65% while Milei slips to 57–60% as economic pain and protests in Argentina outweigh disinflation and any legislative wins. A rounded tie (e.g., both at 60%) would also resolve No.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Milei’s approval stabilizes or bumps on legislative progress (e.g., reform passage) and continued disinflation, keeping him around 60–63%, while Sheinbaum’s softens into the high 50s/low 60s due to early-honeymoon fade or adverse headlines (e.g., governance or service-delivery issues), leaving Milei 1+ point higher on the MC tracker.",
    "rationale": "- Where things stand: The assistant’s report cites Morning Consult at 61% (Milei) vs 60% (Sheinbaum) on Apr 30; in January it was 65% vs 66% (Sheinbaum higher). Both are near one another and within typical week-to-week noise. Domestic polls diverge: Sheinbaum appears very high in Mexican surveys (mid‑70s), while an Argentine poll shows Milei’s image net negative (44% positive, 52% negative). Morning Consult tends to sit below Mexico’s domestic highs and above some harsher Argentine readings, so I anchor on MC’s own trend rather than local polls.\n- Trend and priors: Since January, MC shows both leaders trending modestly down (Milei ~65→61; Sheinbaum ~66→60). Sheinbaum is still in an early-term window, which often decays slowly but can remain elevated; Milei faces recessionary pain despite improving inflation. Net, I expect mild downward or flat pressure on Milei and flat-to-slightly-up for Sheinbaum, keeping them close.\n- Resolution mechanics: A tie resolves No. Given MC’s rounding to whole percentages and typical 1–2 point weekly wiggles, a one-point April edge for Milei does not confer >50% odds; the tie penalty alone nudges the Yes probability below even.\n- Why not higher? Milei’s domestic indicators are weakening, and Sheinbaum’s fundamentals remain solid; with a tie counting as No and MC rounding, the slight current Milei edge is fragile.\n- Why not lower? Recent MC data still had Milei marginally ahead. If Argentine disinflation continues and he secures visible legislative wins, he could hold ~60% while Sheinbaum dips a point or two, which is enough for a Yes.\n- What I’d watch to update:\n  • Toward Yes: MC weekly updates showing Milei sustaining ≥60 while Sheinbaum prints ≤59–60; Argentine legislative victories; visible macro stabilization headlines.\n  • Toward No: MC showing Milei ≤58 or two consecutive weekly declines; Sheinbaum at ≥62 on MC; negative Argentina shocks (protests, policy setbacks) or positive Mexico headlines bolstering her approval.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
