    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a crucial point I underweighted: South Sudan has failed to ratify AfCFTA for seven years since signing, which is a much stronger signal of non-prioritization than I initially credited. This long delay, combined with the country's severe domestic crises, suggests ratification has been consistently deprioritized. Forecaster 3 provides valuable procedural detail about the multiple steps required (legislative approval, presidential assent, AND formal deposit with the AU), noting that administrative capacity constraints make even the final deposit step non-trivial. However, Forecaster 3's optimism about deadline effects and summit timing seems speculative without concrete evidence. The most telling fact is that our research assistant found NO additional information - no parliamentary bills, no official statements, no diplomatic cables suggesting active proceedings. This absence of evidence is quite damning with only 60 days remaining. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the multi-stage process being 'highly unlikely' for a country in South Sudan's situation resonates strongly. While Forecaster 3 correctly notes that processes CAN be expedited when prioritized, we have zero evidence of such prioritization occurring.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I underweighted the significance of the seven-year delay since signing. This is not a matter of slow bureaucracy - it's a demonstrated pattern of non-prioritization that has persisted through multiple political cycles and circumstances. The complete absence of any evidence of active ratification proceedings with only 60 days remaining is highly significant. While I maintain that ratification is technically possible within this timeframe if made an urgent priority, the probability of such prioritization occurring is lower than I initially assessed. The multiple procedural steps (legislative passage, presidential assent, formal AU deposit) create additional friction points, each requiring functional governance capacity - something South Sudan struggles with given ongoing political instability, security crises, and institutional weakness. I'm updating downward from 12% to 8%, closer to Forecaster 2's assessment but maintaining slightly more probability mass for the slim chance of a rapid executive-driven push or unexpected external pressure creating urgency.",
