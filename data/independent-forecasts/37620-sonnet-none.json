    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 20 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - Kadyrov remains Head of the Chechen Republic",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Kadyrov's statement about wanting to step down is either rhetorical, meant for long-term planning, or the actual transition process extends beyond June 1st. He continues as Head of the Chechen Republic through the resolution date, either making no formal moves toward resignation or initiating a transition process that takes longer than 20 days to complete.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Kadyrov follows through quickly on his stated desire to step down, formally announcing his resignation with an effective date before June 1st. A successor is named (likely with Moscow's approval), and the transition occurs within the next 20 days, with official confirmation from credible sources that he has ceased to be Head of the Chechen Republic.",
    "rationale": "The Moscow Times article from May 6, 2025 (6 days ago) indicating Kadyrov wants to step down is significant and cannot be dismissed. However, several factors strongly favor the status quo outcome: (1) The timeframe is extremely short at only 20 days, (2) Kadyrov has held power since 2007 with deep institutional entrenchment, (3) Political statements about stepping down frequently don't result in immediate action, (4) Leadership transitions in the Russian/Chechen political system typically require careful coordination with Moscow and take time to execute properly, and (5) Six days have passed since the statement with no reported concrete steps toward resignation. The status quo bias is particularly strong here - authoritarian leaders rarely exit power quickly, even when expressing such intentions. For my forecast to move significantly higher, I would need to see: an official resignation announcement with a specific date, a named successor, or formal proceedings initiated. For it to move lower, I would need clarification that the statement was rhetorical or long-term planning rather than immediate intention. Given the genuine statement but lack of follow-through and very limited time window, I assess a low but non-negligible probability of actual resignation before June 1st.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ramzan Kadyrov cease to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Moscow Times: [Kadyrov Says He Wants to Step Down as Chechen Leader](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/06/kadyrov-says-he-wants-to-step-down-as-chechen-leader-a88991)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) Ramzan Kadyrov ceases to be the [Head of the Chechen Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_the_Chechen_Republic) before June 1, 2025, for any reason. Otherwise, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
