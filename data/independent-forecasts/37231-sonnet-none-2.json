    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "1-2 weeks. The question asks about April 2025 unemployment data, and today is April 29, 2025. Mexico's unemployment statistics for April 2025 will likely be published by INEGI (National Institute of Statistics and Geography) and appear on Trading Economics within the next 1-2 weeks, typically in mid-May.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "YES (under 3%). Mexico has historically maintained very low unemployment rates, frequently in the 2.5-3% range, with many months falling below the 3% threshold. The country's labor market structure and measurement methodology tend to produce lower unemployment figures compared to many developed economies.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The US tariff threats materialize quickly and severely impact Mexico's auto manufacturing sector and broader supply chains. Job losses accelerate beyond what the labor market can absorb, pushing the unemployment rate to 3.0% or higher by April 2025. The economic disruption spreads from manufacturing to services, creating a broader slowdown that shows up in the April employment data.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Mexico's labor market maintains its historical resilience, with the unemployment rate staying below 3% in April 2025. Any tariff-related economic impacts either haven't fully materialized yet in employment data due to typical lags, or are offset by strength in other sectors. The structural factors that have kept Mexican unemployment low continue to dominate, and the economy proves more resilient to external shocks than feared.",
    "rationale": "Mexico has consistently maintained unemployment rates at or below 3% for many months over recent years, reflecting both structural labor market characteristics and economic conditions. The status quo strongly suggests continuation of this pattern. \n\nThe referenced article about US tariffs and auto supply chain disruptions represents a genuine risk factor. However, several considerations temper this concern: (1) Employment effects from trade policy changes typically lag by several months, and we're looking at April 2025 data which may not fully reflect recent tariff announcements; (2) Mexico's economy has shown resilience to external shocks historically; (3) The labor market has structural features that keep reported unemployment low.\n\nMy research assistant provided no additional current data, which creates uncertainty. Without March 2025 or early 2025 data points, I must rely more heavily on historical patterns and the slow-moving nature of employment statistics.\n\nThis forecast is not higher (closer to 80-90%) because: genuine economic uncertainty exists around tariff impacts, we lack real-time data confirmation, and the auto sector is significant to Mexico's economy. A sustained shock could push rates above 3%.\n\nThis forecast is not lower (closer to 30-40%) because: the status quo strongly favors rates below 3%, Mexico's track record is consistent, employment data tends to be sticky and slow-moving, and policy impacts take time to fully manifest in statistics.\n\nI would update higher with evidence that: recent months showed rates well below 2.5%, Mexican economic indicators remain strong, or tariff impacts prove minimal. I would update lower if: Q1 2025 data showed upward trends toward 3%, evidence emerges of rapid job losses in manufacturing, or broader economic indicators deteriorate sharply.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mexico's unemployment rate be under 3% in April 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAP: [US tariffs ripple through auto supply chains into Mexico](https://apnews.com/article/mexico-stellantis-trump-tariffs-sheinbaum-569ae29d203b1997d50a3a9655c928a8)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Mexico's unemployment rate is less than 3.0% for April 2025 according to data presented by [Trading Economics](https://tradingeconomics.com/mexico/unemployment-rate).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-29.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
