    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis aligns closely with mine, adding the important detail that the President's Office explicitly denied reports of a July 2025 election. Forecaster 3 raises a crucial distinction I initially underweighted: the question asks about an ANNOUNCEMENT, not holding the election. Ukraine could theoretically announce a future election date (e.g., 2026) without violating martial law provisions, using it as a political tool for legitimacy. However, I find Forecaster 3's 35% too optimistic given: (1) the martial law extension literally yesterday sends a strong contrary signal, (2) the President's Office explicit denial referenced by Forecaster 2, (3) any announcement would still require Rada action and political consensus not currently evident, and (4) the strategic logic of 'why now?' when waiting carries less political risk. The reports of high-level discussions are interesting but don't overcome these barriers in a 46-day window.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast upward but remaining skeptical. The key insight is that 'announcement' is indeed a lower bar than holding an election - Ukraine could announce a conditional future date without immediately violating martial law restrictions. This possibility, combined with potential political pressure for democratic legitimacy, warrants higher probability than my initial 3%. However, several factors strongly constrain this: (1) Yesterday's martial law extension to August 6 signals continued status quo, (2) The President's Office explicitly denied election planning, calling such reports 'manipulative', (3) Even an announcement would require Rada action and political will that isn't currently visible, (4) With 46 days remaining, the window is very tight for such a major political pivot. The balance of evidence suggests a modest increase from my baseline, acknowledging the announcement possibility while respecting the strong institutional and political momentum against it.",
