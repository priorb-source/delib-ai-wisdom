    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 4 weeks. The G7 Summit is scheduled for June 2025, and today is June 3rd, 2025, so the event is likely happening later this month, probably in the next 2-3 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Trump attends the summit. The White House has officially confirmed his attendance.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A last-minute health emergency affects Trump or a close family member, requiring him to cancel. Alternatively, a major domestic crisis (terrorist attack, natural disaster, or political emergency) prevents him from leaving the United States. A severe diplomatic incident with Canada could also lead to a boycott or cancellation.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump follows through on the White House's official confirmation and travels to Canada to attend the G7 Summit in person, meeting with other world leaders face-to-face as planned.",
    "rationale": "The strongest evidence supporting a Yes outcome is the White House's official confirmation that Trump will attend. This is not speculation or tentative planning - it's an official announcement. G7 summits are major diplomatic events that US presidents routinely attend, and Trump attended these summits during his first term (2017-2021). We're now in early June 2025, very close to when the summit will occur, and no cancellation has been reported. The status quo strongly favors attendance. However, I'm not assigning near-certainty because Trump has demonstrated unpredictability in his decision-making and has cancelled or modified plans before. Health issues, domestic emergencies, or sudden diplomatic tensions could intervene. The specific criteria requiring 'in person' attendance means even a hybrid or virtual participation wouldn't count. Weather, logistics, or security concerns could also prevent physical attendance. My forecast is not higher (95%+) because unforeseen circumstances remain possible even days before major events, and Trump's past behavior suggests he's willing to break with convention. It's not lower (70% or below) because official White House confirmation combined with the proximity to the event and absence of any reported obstacles makes attendance highly likely. I would update higher if we received reports of Trump already being en route or arriving in Canada. I would update lower if health concerns emerged, if a major crisis developed, or if tensions with Canada escalated significantly.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump attend the G7 Summit in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nCTV: [Donald Trump will visit Canada for G7, White House confirms](https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/article/white-house-confirms-trump-will-visit-canada-for-g7-leaders-summit/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if US President Donald J. Trump attends in person a G7 summit held in June 2025.\n\n\"In person\" is defined as occupying the same physical space closely enough at the G7 Summit that he can see and hear other heads of state through direct un-intermediated exchange of photons and sound waves.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-06-03.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
