    "review": "Forecaster 2 and Forecaster 3 present compelling but contrasting views. Forecaster 2's optimism (70%) hinges on interpreting the April 29 meeting as evidence that the decision is essentially made, with only announcement timing uncertain. However, this seems to conflate political interest with administrative completion. Forecaster 3's pessimism (30%) emphasizes a critical point I underweighted: we are 18-20 months from the 2026 event, which is PAST the typical 24-36 month announcement window, not within it. This suggests the ITKF may be running behind schedule or not treating this as urgent. Forecaster 3's observation about decisions often aligning with scheduled congresses is astute—without knowing when the ITKF board meets, we can't assume an announcement is imminent. The absence of any bid documentation, website updates, or formal timelines as of mid-May, despite the high-level meeting, suggests bureaucratic processes are still in early stages. Forecaster 2's 70% appears overly optimistic given these constraints.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I gave insufficient weight to the status quo and the fact that we're past the typical announcement window rather than approaching it. With only 54 days until July 1 and no public evidence of formal bid processes, timelines, or ITKF board scheduling, the pathway to announcement is narrower than I initially assessed. The April 29 meeting indicates interest but not necessarily imminent decision-making. International sports federations typically require board approvals, legal reviews, contracts, and coordinated announcements—processes that rarely complete in under 8 weeks from a preliminary meeting. While Egypt's strong credentials and lack of competing bids remain positive factors, these don't overcome the temporal and procedural constraints. The absence of any ITKF website mention or documentation suggests the federation hasn't prioritized or formalized Egypt's bid yet. I'm updating downward to account for: (1) being past rather than within the typical announcement window, (2) absence of any public formal processes, (3) unknown ITKF board meeting schedule, and (4) only 7-8 weeks remaining. However, I'm not going as low as 30% because smaller federations can move quickly, Egypt has genuine momentum, and no competing bids exist.",
