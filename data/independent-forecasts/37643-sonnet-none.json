    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the objective remains marked as 'in progress'",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration either does not complete termination of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program before July 1, 2025, or takes preliminary steps that the spreadsheet maintainers do not consider sufficient to mark as 'complete'. Given the statutory nature of PSLF and typical policy implementation timelines, the program likely continues operating through the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration issues executive action or regulatory changes that effectively terminate the PSLF program within the next 48 days, and the Keep_Track spreadsheet maintainers determine these actions are sufficient to mark the objective as 'complete' rather than merely 'in progress'. This would require both swift administrative action and rapid verification by the community-maintained tracker.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a No resolution. With only 48 days remaining, terminating a statutory program like PSLF faces significant practical and legal hurdles. The Public Service Loan Forgiveness program is established by law (College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007) and serves hundreds of thousands of borrowers. Complete termination would require either congressional action (extremely unlikely in this timeframe) or complex regulatory changes that would face immediate legal challenges and implementation delays. Even if the administration announces intent to terminate or takes preliminary regulatory steps, the spreadsheet maintainers - operating a community tracker - would likely maintain 'in progress' status until termination is demonstrably complete and operational. Major policy changes typically take months to years, not weeks. While the Trump administration has shown willingness to act aggressively on various policies, and Project 2025 represents organized conservative policy goals, the combination of legal complexity, short timeframe, and conservative marking standards for 'complete' status heavily favors the status quo. My forecast is not higher because executive action could theoretically move quickly, and the administration might prioritize this objective. It's not lower because small probability remains that aggressive regulatory action could be announced and marked complete based on policy declaration rather than full implementation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of terminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"terminate the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-14.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
