    "review": "Both forecasters lean on the same pillars I used: recent Quebec polling, seat models, and historical patterns. Forecaster 2 adds a clear worst/best-case comparison from projections (BQ 19 vs CPC 12 at the extremes), which underscores how much cushion the Bloc currently has. However, I find their statement that aggregates show a 5–17 point BQ lead over CPC inconsistent with the provided toplines (BQ 23–27 vs CPC ~23); that range seems too wide and likely overstates the margin. Forecaster 3’s emphasis on structural vote distribution and the threshold for a meaningful downgrade (CPC ≥15 seats, BQ ≤15) is sensible and aligns with how Quebec’s regional dynamics translate to seats. Both appropriately flag volatility with six months to go. Overall, their reasoning is broadly convincing and directionally consistent with my view, though I discount the exaggerated poll-margin claim from Forecaster 2.",
    "rationale": "Core facts remain: province-wide, BQ modestly leads CPC; Liberals are the ones surging; and reputable seat models keep BQ ahead by a material margin (roughly BQ 19–25 vs CPC 10–12). The Liberal rise appears to pull more from the Bloc than the Conservatives, but that doesn’t clearly help CPC surpass the Bloc in seats because CPC’s support is still regionally concentrated (Quebec City/south shore), and many three-way contests that flip away from the Bloc are likelier to go Liberal than Conservative. The reported CPC candidate issue in Quebec City marginally trims CPC upside in its strongest area. The lack of overlap in typical projection ranges provides a meaningful buffer. Risks remain: further Bloc erosion into the low 20s, CPC breaking out beyond Quebec City into francophone regions, or shifting turnout could compress the seat gap. I would move down if multiple Quebec polls showed CPC overtaking the Bloc among francophones and models lifted CPC’s Quebec median to ~13–15 while dropping the Bloc below ~15. I would move up if the Bloc stabilizes ≥25–26% with CPC ≤22–23% and models widen BQ’s median edge (e.g., BQ ≥22 vs CPC ≤10). Given the consensus and projection cushion, I’m nudging my estimate up slightly.",
