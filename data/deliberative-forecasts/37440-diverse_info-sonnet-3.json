    "review": "Forecaster 2 provides crucial new information that I had not considered: CS/HB 1381 was explicitly withdrawn from consideration on May 3, 2025, just three days ago. This is a major negative signal that dramatically changes the forecast. The withdrawal isn't merely a passive failure to advance - it represents an active decision to pull the bill, suggesting insufficient support, legal concerns, or deprioritization even within the Republican-controlled legislature. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the regular session definitively ending (Sine Die May 2) and the extended session being constitutionally focused on budget items is well-founded.\n\nForecaster 3 raises important nuances about legal complexity (NVRA conflicts) and resolution criteria (administrative database checks alone wouldn't count), but arrives at 38% which now seems too high given the withdrawal.\n\nBoth forecasters correctly identify that the remaining path requires either a special session or unusual action in the budget-focused extended session. Forecaster 2's argument that special sessions require significant political capital and that the withdrawal signals lack of urgency is compelling. While DeSantis has demonstrated recent willingness to sign election legislation, calling a special session specifically for this issue within 56 days after the main bill was just withdrawn seems unlikely.",
    "rationale": "I am updating my forecast downward significantly based on the critical new information about CS/HB 1381's withdrawal on May 3, 2025. My original 38% forecast was predicated on the possibility that legislation might still be advancing through the normal process. The active withdrawal of the primary vehicle bill just three days ago is strong evidence that passage before July 1 is now highly unlikely.\n\nThe remaining scenarios for Yes resolution are now quite narrow: (1) Governor DeSantis calls a special session specifically for this issue, or (2) an unexpected revival or new bill emerges in the budget-focused extended session. Both scenarios require overcoming significant hurdles that the legislature apparently decided not to tackle during the regular session.\n\nI maintain slightly higher probability than Forecaster 2's 15% because: (1) DeSantis demonstrated recent activism on election issues with his May 2025 signing, (2) the Republican supermajority retains the technical ability to act quickly if motivated, and (3) national momentum exists. However, the withdrawal signal is strong enough that I'm revising down to approximately 18% - close to Forecaster 2's assessment but preserving modest probability for a special session scenario.",
