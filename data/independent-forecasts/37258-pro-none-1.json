    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish Government under the SNP continues to advocate for independence but, recognizing the legal and political barriers imposed by the UK Supreme Court ruling and the UK Government's refusal to grant a Section 30 order, refrains from unilaterally announcing a referendum date. The political landscape remains in a stalemate, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an official announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Capitalizing on a significant and sustained lead for independence in the polls, the Scottish First Minister makes a strategic decision to force a political confrontation. They officially announce a target date for a consultative independence referendum, challenging the UK Government to either legally block the vote or engage on the issue. This act, made by an authority within Scotland, satisfies the resolution criteria regardless of the subsequent legal challenges from Westminster.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is anchored in the strong status quo, which is that no independence referendum is scheduled. The UK Supreme Court has ruled that the Scottish Parliament cannot legislate for a referendum without Westminster's consent, which the UK government has consistently refused to grant. This creates a significant legal and political barrier to a referendum being scheduled, making 'No' the baseline and most probable outcome.\n\nHowever, the provided information of an 11-point lead for the 'Yes' side in a recent poll is a critical variable that significantly increases the probability of a 'Yes' outcome. Such strong public support for independence places immense pressure on the Scottish National Party (SNP) government to act decisively on its core political mandate. Failure to do so could be perceived as weakness and demotivate its base.\n\nThe resolution criteria are crucial: the question resolves 'Yes' with a mere official announcement from a Scottish authority, irrespective of its legality under UK law. This lowers the bar for a 'Yes' outcome considerably. The Scottish Government does not need to secure a legally-binding referendum, only announce a date for one. This could be a purely tactical move to galvanize the independence movement and create a political crisis for the UK government.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 20% because the timeframe is extremely short (less than two months), and unilaterally announcing a referendum that cannot be legally delivered carries significant political risks. It could be dismissed as a stunt and potentially backfire. The Scottish Government may prefer a longer-term strategy of building sustained support rather than making a short-term gamble.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 20% because the political pressure created by a large polling lead cannot be understated. For a party whose primary goal is independence, such a clear signal from the populace may compel action, and a symbolic announcement is the most readily available tool. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there were further polls confirming a large 'Yes' lead or if influential figures within the SNP began publicly calling for an immediate referendum announcement. I would decrease my forecast if subsequent polls showed the 'Yes' lead diminishing or if the Scottish First Minister explicitly outlined a longer-term strategy that precludes an announcement before the deadline.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
