    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (from May 15, 2025, to the July 1, 2025, deadline).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of today, the Starlink map does not show Chad as 'Available'. If there are no changes before the deadline, the question will resolve as No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Despite securing a license in late 2024, Starlink encounters minor logistical or final administrative delays. The setup of ground station infrastructure or the final regulatory green light for service activation is pushed back by a few weeks, causing the service to launch in July or August 2025, after the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Following the license approval in November 2024, Starlink completes the necessary preparations, including ground station deployment and final testing. In the weeks leading up to July 1, 2025, they officially launch commercial service in Chad, and the availability map is updated accordingly to show 'Available'.",
    "rationale": "The most critical factor influencing this forecast is the public announcement from November 2024 that SpaceX secured an operating license in Chad. This is the largest and most time-consuming hurdle for Starlink's entry into a new market. Obtaining this license over seven months before the question's deadline provides a substantial window for the company to handle the remaining logistical and technical preparations, such as deploying ground gateways and preparing for user terminal distribution.\n\nStarlink has a track record of expanding service relatively quickly after securing regulatory approval, particularly in its aggressive push across Africa. The period between license approval and service launch is typically on the order of several months, not years. Given that more than half a year has already passed since the license was granted, it is highly probable that the launch is imminent.\n\nThe forecast is not higher than 75% because Starlink's projected timelines on its own availability map are frequently subject to delays. Minor, unforeseen issues in logistics, supply chains, or final bureaucratic sign-offs could easily push the launch date from June 2025 to July or August 2025. The relatively short remaining time frame of 1.5 months means there is little buffer for even small delays.\n\nThe forecast is not lower than 75% because the primary barrier to entry has been cleared for a long time. The motivation for SpaceX to activate the service and begin generating revenue is strong. A delay at this stage would likely be for minor operational reasons rather than a fundamental obstacle, making a launch within the next six weeks more likely than not.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were official announcements from either Starlink or the Chadian government mentioning a specific launch date before July 1. I would decrease my forecast if the Starlink map updated Chad's status to a later timeframe (e.g., 'Q3 2025') or if reports emerged of new, unexpected regulatory or logistical problems.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Starlink's website show Chad as a country with Starlink availability before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[SpaceX’s Starlink Secures License to Operate in Chad](https://spaceinafrica.com/2024/11/12/spacexs-starlink-secures-license-to-operate-in-chad/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the [Starlink Availability Map](https://www.starlink.com/us/map) has anywhere in Chad listed as \"Available.\"\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
