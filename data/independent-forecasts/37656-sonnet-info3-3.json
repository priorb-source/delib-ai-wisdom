  "information": "The executive action has prompted debate in Congress. Some Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have expressed support for public media, citing the importance of local programming and emergency alerts in rural communities. Federal funding is considered crucial for many local stations, with some receiving up to 25% of their annual revenues from the federal government. According to their respective CEOs, about 15% of the public network's budget comes from public funds for PBS, while NPR receives less than 5% of its budget from the CPB.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The objective remains marked as 'in progress' or moves to another non-complete status, resulting in a No resolution",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Congressional opposition (including from Republicans like Senator Murkowski) delays or blocks defunding legislation. Executive actions face legal challenges or implementation delays. The Keep_Track maintainers determine that insufficient progress has been made to mark the objective as 'complete' by July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration implements executive actions to cut CPB funding, or Congress passes legislation defunding NPR and PBS. The Keep_Track maintainers determine this constitutes sufficient completion of the objective and update the spreadsheet to mark it as 'complete' before July 1.",
    "rationale": "The timeline is very tight at approximately 6 weeks. The objective is already marked 'in progress,' indicating active efforts underway, which suggests movement but also that completion hasn't been achieved yet despite time that has already passed. Key factors working against completion: (1) Congressional opposition exists even within Republican ranks, with senators like Murkowski supporting public media for rural communities; (2) The legislative process typically takes months, not weeks; (3) Federal funding represents a relatively small portion of these organizations' budgets (under 5% for NPR, 15% for PBS), which may complicate what 'stopping funding' means. Factors favoring completion: (1) The 'in progress' status suggests concrete actions are being taken; (2) Executive actions could potentially be implemented more quickly than legislation; (3) The Keep_Track maintainers might mark the objective 'complete' based on announced policy changes rather than full implementation. The critical uncertainty is the subjective judgment of the spreadsheet maintainers about what constitutes 'complete' - this could range from an executive order announcement to fully implemented budget cuts. Given the short timeline, political complexity, and definitional ambiguity, but accounting for the active 'in progress' status, I estimate moderate-low probability. I would update higher if seeing concrete executive orders or fast-tracked legislation in the next 2-3 weeks. I would update lower if significant congressional roadblocks emerge or if the administration deprioritizes this objective.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker spreadsheet have the objective of stopping funding for NPR and PBS marked as complete before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAt the time of this question, the objective was marked as \"in progress.\" The 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the Project 2025 objective to \"stop funding for NPR and PBS\" is marked as complete according to [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGG6wNHna-1tt91yXNkOauAJJ7snobFjfEnmxlmzhl4/edit?gid=0#gid=0) before July 1, 2025. If it is anything other than complete (such as \"in progress\") when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe executive action has prompted debate in Congress.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
