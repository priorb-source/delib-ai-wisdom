    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 2 weeks. The election is on May 2, 2025, and results are expected within a day or two.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Conservative Party currently holds a large majority (45 of 64 seats) on the council. Reform UK holds zero seats. Standard political shifts would likely see gains for the Labour party, not a victory for a party with no current representation.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Conservative vote collapses due to national unpopularity, but the primary beneficiary is the Labour Party, which becomes the largest party on the council. Reform UK wins a notable share of the vote but fails to convert this into more than a handful of seats under the first-past-the-post system.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "An unprecedented political realignment occurs where the Conservative vote almost completely collapses and transfers directly to Reform UK. This allows Reform to win pluralities in a large number of rural and semi-rural divisions, emerging as the largest single party while the Labour and Liberal Democrat vote remains concentrated in urban areas.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo and the structural realities of the UK's first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system. Currently, Reform UK holds zero seats on the Derbyshire County Council, while the Conservatives hold 45. Overcoming this deficit to become the single largest party is an exceptionally high bar. While national polls show a surge for Reform, translating this into seats in local elections is notoriously difficult for challenger parties whose support is geographically spread out. It is far more likely that Reform will split the right-wing vote, potentially helping Labour gain seats from the Conservatives, rather than winning a large number of seats themselves. The 2021 results show a solid Conservative base, and while this is expected to erode significantly, a complete transfer to Reform is improbable; Labour is better positioned as the traditional opposition to capitalize on this decline. My probability is not zero because the current political climate is highly volatile, and a major upset is not impossible. However, my probability is not higher because there is no specific local polling or on-the-ground evidence from Derbyshire to suggest Reform can overcome the huge structural disadvantages to win the most seats. I would require division-level polling showing Reform leading in at least 20 divisions to significantly increase my forecast.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
