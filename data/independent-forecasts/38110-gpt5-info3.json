  "information": "Historical data on similar situations in West Africa show that border closures motivated by security concerns often persist for many months. For example, Nigeria's border closure with Benin in 2019-2020 lasted for about 16 months. Similarly, Benin's border with Niger, closed after the 2023 coup, remained shut many months later. A review of 15 security-related border closures in the ECOWAS region since 2015 indicates that approximately 20% were reopened within 60 days. Reopenings within two months are more common when the reasons are purely commercial or administrative, rather than related to terrorism or arms smuggling.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 30 days (until June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the crossings remain closed past June 30 absent a clear security improvement and official announcement.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Benin maintains the closures while security forces conduct operations against the alleged terror/arms-smuggling networks. Sporadic incidents or intelligence warnings continue, and authorities allow only humanitarian or tightly controlled movements without declaring the border “reopened.”",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Nigeria and Benin conduct joint security measures (patrols/checkpoints) and agree on tighter controls for targeted goods; a governor/prefect or interior ministry publicly announces that the specific Kwara crossings shut in May have reopened, possibly ahead of increased travel/trade late in June.",
    "rationale": "Time horizon is short and the stated rationale includes terrorism and arms smuggling, which typically prolong closures. The research assistant’s review of 15 ECOWAS security-related closures since 2015 finds about 20% reopen within 60 days; reopenings within two months are more common when motives are commercial/administrative rather than security. Here, reporting points to security (new terror group “Mahmuda,” arms smuggling) alongside commercial concerns (soya exportation), tilting the base rate toward the security pattern. Historical context also leans sticky: Nigeria’s 2019–2020 closure with Benin lasted ~16 months; Benin’s post-2023-coup closures with Niger persisted for many months. While those cases are broader and not perfectly comparable, they illustrate that security-driven border measures in the region often outlast a month or two. Countervailing pressures exist: cross-border trade is economically important; local communities and politicians on both sides may push for relief; and authorities sometimes reopen with enhanced checks. A mid-to-late June reopening tied to a joint security communiqué is plausible, though not the modal outcome. Why not higher than this forecast: the explicit terrorism/arms-smuggling justification and the short 30-day window make rapid normalization less likely. Why not lower: the closure appears geographically limited (Kwara crossings), and mixed motives (commercial plus security) raise the chance of a negotiated, partial reopening within weeks, especially if calm holds. What would move me up: credible reports of successful security operations/arrests, an official statement calling the closure temporary with a timeline, news of a Nigeria–Benin joint task force and planned ‘controlled reopening,’ or local prefect/governor notices allowing normal traffic. What would move me down: any fresh attacks or seizures linked to the corridor, announcements extending or expanding closures, or deterioration in Nigeria–Benin coordination.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Benin re-open its closed land border crossings with Nigeria's Kwara state before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Exclusive: Benin Rep.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
