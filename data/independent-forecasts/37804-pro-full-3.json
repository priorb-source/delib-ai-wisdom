  "information": "In April 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced plans to instruct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to stop recommending community water fluoridation. HHS confirmed it would convene the Community Preventive Services Task Force to study and issue a new recommendation. Concurrently, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is reviewing 'new scientific information' on potential health risks of fluoride. Additionally, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has begun the process of phasing out ingestible fluoride tablets and drops from the market.\n\nFlorida has become the second U.S. state, after Utah, to ban the addition of fluoride to public water supplies. Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law in May 2025 that prohibits additives not meeting a new definition of 'water quality additive,' effectively banning fluoride. The decision was supported by the state's surgeon general, who cited potential health risks. This legislative action reflects a broader debate, with some recent studies raising concerns about potential links between fluoride exposure and neurodevelopmental issues in children, while organizations like the American Dental Association continue to support water fluoridation as a key public health measure.\n\nThe U.S. Public Health Service and the CDC last changed the recommended fluoride level in 2015, when it was updated from a range of 0.7–1.2 mg/L to a single level of 0.7 mg/L. That revision process took four years, including public comment periods and interagency review. As of spring 2025, major professional organizations including the American Dental Association (ADA), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the Association of State and Territorial Dental Directors (ASTDD) have reiterated their support for the current 0.7 mg/L recommendation.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "42 days (from May 20, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes, if no action is taken, the CDC's recommendation will remain 0.7 mg/L.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Under direct instruction from the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the CDC acts quickly to either remove the recommendation page from its website pending review, or officially lowers or withdraws the recommendation. This would be a politically-driven, expedited action bypassing the typical lengthy scientific review process.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The standard process for changing a major public health recommendation, which involves convening task forces, public comment, and extensive review, cannot be completed in the short time before the resolution date. Despite political pressure, bureaucratic and institutional inertia at the CDC prevents any change from being made to the official recommendation on its website by July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the conflict between strong political will for change and the significant institutional inertia of a federal public health agency. The primary factor supporting a 'No' outcome is the April 2025 announcement by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. of his intent to have the CDC stop recommending water fluoridation. This high-level political pressure, combined with concurrent reviews by the EPA and FDA and state-level bans, creates a powerful momentum for change. An expedited action, such as taking the recommendation page down 'pending review,' is a plausible method to achieve this political goal quickly and would resolve the question as 'No'.\n\nHowever, the status quo is a powerful force. The last update to this recommendation in 2015 took four years. The required scientific and administrative processes to formally alter a recommendation are deliberately slow and thorough. It is highly unlikely that the newly convened Community Preventive Services Task Force could complete its study and issue a new, formally adopted recommendation in the approximately ten weeks between the announcement and the resolution date. This bureaucratic inertia is the primary reason supporting a 'Yes' outcome.\n\nMy forecast of 60% probability leans towards the status quo holding, as short-term predictions should generally weigh institutional inertia heavily. The timeframe of just over a month is the most critical factor favoring 'Yes'. My probability is not higher because the political pressure is explicit, direct, and comes from the highest level of the CDC's parent department, making an unusual, rapid administrative action a distinct possibility. It is not lower because federal agencies are generally resistant to abrupt, politically-motivated changes to scientific guidance without a comprehensive review process, which cannot be completed by July 1. I would update my forecast towards 'No' if there are reports of a specific directive being issued to the CDC to take immediate action. I would update towards 'Yes' if HHS or CDC officials make public statements emphasizing their commitment to a standard, lengthy review process.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC still recommend 0.7 mg/L fluoride as the optimal level in community water supplies on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNPR: [HHS will review guidance on the addition of fluoride to drinking water](https://www.npr.org/2025/04/10/g-s1-59452/hhs-rfk-fluoride-drinking-water-epa)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the CDC's [Community Water Fluoridation Recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/about/community-water-fluoridation-recommendations.html) recommends greater than or equal to 0.7 mg/L as the concentration that maximizes fluoride's oral health benefits while minimizing potential harms. If a lesser amount is recommended or if there is no longer any recommendation at all, then the question resolves as **No**.\n\nIf the page is pulled offline with no replacement, this question also resolves as **No**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn April 2025, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower.
