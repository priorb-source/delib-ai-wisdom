    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 54 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — absent an official ITKF announcement before the deadline, the question resolves No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discussions between Egypt and the ITKF continue without a formal award, the federation follows a longer bid/approval timeline (e.g., defers to a later 2025 congress), or a different host is chosen/previously chosen but not yet widely reported. No clear, dated ITKF announcement naming Egypt appears by July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The ITKF Executive Board/General Assembly meets in May/June 2025, Egypt provides a formal bid plus government guarantees, and the ITKF issues an official, dated announcement (website or official social channels/press release) before July 1, 2025 explicitly stating that Egypt will host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship.",
    "rationale": "- Evidence on hand: The cited report indicates Egypt’s sports minister discussed hosting 2026 with the ITKF president — a positive but early-stage signal. My research assistant found no additional confirming information (no official ITKF announcement identified as of today).\n- Timing: The window is short (~7.5 weeks). Even if Egypt is a leading candidate, federations often finalize and publish host awards at scheduled governance meetings. If the relevant ITKF meeting is after July 1, or if due diligence takes longer, this will miss the deadline.\n- Status quo weight: There is currently no announcement. Most things don’t change quickly; thus the base expectation is No unless we see a concrete trigger (e.g., a scheduled ITKF decision session with a communiqué).\n- Why not higher: Lack of any official signal yet; possibility that the 2026 host was already chosen (to someone else) or that ITKF timelines push the decision into later 2025; small federations can also experience communication lags that delay public announcements.\n- Why not lower: A minister-level meeting with the ITKF president suggests serious intent and potential government backing, which can accelerate selection for a smaller international federation; 2026 is approaching, so awarding the host in mid-2025 is plausible.\n- What would move me up: An ITKF notice of an imminent executive meeting or congress in May/June with host selection on the agenda; reports of Egypt submitting a formal bid with funding guarantees; leaks or regional press citing ITKF sources that Egypt is the agreed host.\n- What would move me down: Credible reports that another country has been selected, or ITKF scheduling the host decision for after July 1; silence from both ITKF and Egyptian authorities through mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the International Traditional Karate Federation announce that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship?\n\nQuestion background:\nVetoGate Egypt: [Ashraf Sobhi discusses hosting the 2026 World Cup with the President of the International Traditional Karate Federation](https://www.vetogate.com/5400045)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, the International Traditional Karate Federation announces that Egypt has been chosen to host the 2026 Traditional Karate World Championship.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
