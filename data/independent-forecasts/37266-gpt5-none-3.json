    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until June 30, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No – Mozambique remains at Level 2 or Level 3 with localized “Do Not Travel” areas (e.g., parts of Cabo Delgado) but not countrywide Level 4.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Insurgency activity stays largely confined to the north; protests remain sporadic and manageable; the U.S. Embassy remains fully operational; State’s periodic review maintains Mozambique at Level 2/3 with regional cautions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sharp nationwide deterioration prompts State to escalate to Level 4, such as: major mass-casualty attacks or expansion of insurgent violence into major cities; sustained, violent nationwide unrest and government crackdown; an ordered departure or severe curtailment of Embassy operations due to security threats; or an extreme disaster/health emergency causing systemic breakdown in safety and services.",
    "rationale": "- Timeframe: ~2 months is short for a countrywide advisory jump absent a major new shock.\n- Status quo/base rate: Mozambique has historically been Level 2 or 3 with “Do Not Travel” caveats for parts of Cabo Delgado. Countrywide Level 4 is typically reserved for places with widespread conflict, severe state fragility, or Embassy drawdowns (e.g., Haiti, Sudan). Upgrades to Level 4 are uncommon and usually tied to acute, widely disruptive events.\n- Current risk factors: Ongoing insurgency in Cabo Delgado and occasional protests increase risk but have not recently produced nationwide instability. Cyclone season is tapering, lowering the probability of a catastrophic natural-disaster trigger in the short window. A sudden, severe security incident or an Embassy posture change would be the most plausible catalysts.\n- Why not higher: There’s no clear evidence of imminent nationwide breakdown or Embassy drawdown; State generally prefers Level 3 plus regional “Do Not Travel” where risk is localized.\n- Why not lower: The insurgency persists; protests have occurred; a low-probability/high-impact event (major attack in Maputo or rapid spread of violence) could force a swift Level 4 change.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of (1) large-scale attacks outside the far north, (2) sustained, violent nationwide unrest, (3) U.S. Embassy security alerts indicating ordered departure/limited services, or (4) a major disaster/health emergency causing severe disruption. What would move me down: Continued localized violence without national spillover and steady Embassy posture through early June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mozambique receive a \"Level 4 – Do Not Travel\" travel advisory from the US State Department before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nMSN: [ATTA issues travel advisory for Mozambique amid protests](https://www.msn.com/en-za/travel/travel-preparation/atta-issues-travel-advisory-for-mozambique-amid-protests/ar-AA1wHavB?ocid=BingNewsVerp)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the country of Mozambique has received a Level 4 [travel advisory](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages/Mozambique.html) from the US Department of State before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
