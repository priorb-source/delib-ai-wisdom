    "review": "Both forecasters settled on 40%, raising several important points I should consider. Forecaster 2 makes an intriguing argument about treasury bond distribution potentially counting as payment, though I find this speculative given the resolution criteria references the April 9 cash payment as the baseline. Forecaster 3's point about the remaining $6.9 million budgeted for 2025 is concrete evidence I underweighted - this shows funds are specifically allocated. Both acknowledge the timing constraint but seem more optimistic about the 38-day window than I was. However, I notice neither forecaster strongly engages with the payment cadence argument that I consider central. The European farmers comparison (February payment, next likely months later) provides a real-world model for how Zimbabwe structures these disbursements. Both forecasters cite Zimbabwe's recent commitment and capacity, which I agree with, but this doesn't necessarily translate to rapid successive payments within 5 weeks.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating modestly upward but maintaining my core position. The strongest new evidence is the $6.9 million remaining in the 2025 budget - this is more concrete than I initially weighted. The April 9 payment being only 14 days ago does demonstrate active engagement. However, my central argument about payment cadence remains compelling and inadequately addressed by the other forecasters. The European farmers precedent (one payment in February, multi-year schedule through 2028) strongly suggests quarterly or semi-annual disbursements, not monthly. With typical government bureaucracy, 38 days from the first payment to a second payment would be unusually rapid. No announcements indicate an imminent second payment. Zimbabwe's economic constraints (drought, liquidity issues) argue for deliberate pacing. The status quo for such compensation programs is infrequent, scheduled payments. While I acknowledge the remaining budget provides means and recent action shows capability, the probability of a second disbursement in this specific 5-week window remains relatively low. I'm updating from 25% to 32% to account for the budget allocation evidence and demonstrated commitment, while maintaining that payment timing patterns favor a longer interval.",
