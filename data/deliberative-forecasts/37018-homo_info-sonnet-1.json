    "review": "Both forecasters provide crucial information I lacked. Forecaster 2 identifies specific competitive context: 7 nominees in Entertainer (including defending champion Lainey Wilson), 5 in Female Artist, and critically, that Ella Langley leads with 8 total nominations and Lainey Wilson has 7 versus Ballerini's 3. This nomination count differential is a strong signal about industry favor. Forecaster 3 introduces Ballerini's historical 6.5% win rate per nomination, which is substantially below typical conversion rates and indicates she consistently faces tough competition or hasn't been a top-tier contender. Both forecasters use more grounded base rates than my initial approach. My 42% forecast now appears too optimistic given this competitive intelligence. The total nomination count ratio (8:3 and 7:3) is particularly damning - it suggests the Academy is significantly more enthusiastic about other artists this year. However, I'm not going as low as 22% because: (1) Forecaster 3's historical rate may not fully capture current momentum from The Voice and touring, (2) three shots still provides meaningful odds, and (3) neither forecaster discussed the Music Event category in detail, which could be less competitive than the major categories.",
    "rationale": "Revising downward substantially from 42% based on new competitive information. The combination of historical underperformance (6.5% win rate), strong competition from artists with 2-3x more nominations, and facing a defending champion in Entertainer makes my initial forecast untenable. However, I'm not adopting the lowest estimate (22%) because: three nominations genuinely provide multiple pathways to success, recent career visibility (The Voice, arena tour) may improve her standing beyond historical patterns, and awards often include surprises. The Music Event category for 'Cowboys Cry Too' remains underanalyzed by all forecasters and could be more winnable than the major artist categories. Settling near Forecaster 2's estimate of 28%, which balances the mathematical advantage of multiple nominations against the clear evidence she's not favored in any specific category.",
