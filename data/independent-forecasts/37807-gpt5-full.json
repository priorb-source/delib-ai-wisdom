  "information": "The current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is Brooke Rollins, who was sworn in around February 2025. Secretary Rollins has expressed support for SNAP reforms as part of a 'Make America Healthy Again' initiative, which is also championed by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In legislative developments, the House Budget Committee has cleared a Republican spending package that includes proposed cuts to SNAP and stricter work requirements. Separately, Secretary Rollins plans to announce a USDA reorganization plan and further staff reductions in late May 2025.\n\nSeveral states are pursuing federal waivers to restrict the use of SNAP benefits for certain items. Nebraska became the first state to receive a waiver to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks, with the ban taking effect on January 1, 2026. Following this, Idaho submitted a similar waiver on May 16, 2025, to ban soft drinks and candy, with a decision expected in the coming weeks. Arkansas is seeking USDA clearance to make candy and soda ineligible starting in July 2026, while also proposing to add rotisserie chicken to the list of eligible foods. Indiana is also pursuing similar restrictions.\n\nChanges to national SNAP eligibility rules require either a congressional amendment to the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 or a formal USDA rulemaking process. The Act broadly authorizes SNAP benefits for 'any food or food product intended for human consumption.' In the past, the USDA has rejected state waiver requests to restrict specific food items due to concerns about implementation challenges, costs, and the potential impact on recipients. According to the USDA, approximately 20% of all SNAP spending goes towards sugary drinks and snacks.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 6 weeks (≈42 days), until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes — the page continues to list “snack foods” as eligible",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "USDA revises the “What Can SNAP Buy?” page before July 1, 2025, removing the exact phrase “snack foods” (e.g., replacing it with “snacks,” “snack items,” or omitting the category altogether) even though underlying national eligibility hasn’t yet changed.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The page remains unchanged or is updated but still explicitly includes the exact phrase “snack foods” as an example of eligible items.",
    "rationale": "As of May 5, 2025, the USDA page explicitly lists “snack foods.” The legal baseline under the Food and Nutrition Act still allows “any food or food product intended for human consumption,” and national changes would require Congress or formal USDA rulemaking. The research assistant notes that current reform momentum is moving through state waivers (e.g., Nebraska’s soda/energy-drink ban effective Jan 1, 2026; Idaho/Arkansas/Indiana pursuing similar waivers). That trajectory supports the view that federal eligibility language will not be substantively altered in the next six weeks. Communications could shift, but removing “snack foods” now would risk confusing or misrepresenting current national rules. The most realistic path to a No outcome is an editorial or messaging change that swaps out the exact phrase “snack foods” for a synonym or trims examples. That’s plausible given a new USDA leadership (Sec. Brooke Rollins) and a broader push to restrict purchases, plus an impending USDA reorganization in late May 2025. However, absent a formal rule change, wholesale content changes that obscure current eligibility are less likely, and this page historically changes infrequently. Weighting the status quo heavily and the short timeline to July 1, I expect the phrase to remain. Why not higher: non-trivial risk of a wording tweak that avoids the exact phrase “snack foods” to align optics with the administration’s messaging. Why not lower: legal status hasn’t changed; state waivers are future-dated; and agencies typically avoid prematurely altering core eligibility descriptions. Upward adjustments: signals that USDA will emphasize clarity about current law (e.g., guidance stating that national rules remain unchanged while states may seek waivers) or no sign of site-wide content refresh by mid-June. Downward adjustments: evidence of a SNAP communications push deemphasizing “junk food” eligibility, a website redesign, or edits replacing “snack foods” with synonyms before July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA still list \"snack foods\" on its \"What Can SNAP Buy?\" page on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNY Post: [Americans on food stamps could be banned from buying ‘bad food and sugary drinks,’ Trump USDA chief says](https://nypost.com/2025/02/14/us-news/americans-on-food-stamps-could-be-banned-from-buying-bad-food-and-sugary-drinks-trump-usda-chief-says/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if \"snack foods\" is specifically listed on the United States Department of Agriculture's [What Can SNAP Buy?](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/eligible-food-items) webpage as something that is explicitly mentioned as something that can can be purchased by recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (Forecasters please note that it *is* explicitly mentioned as of May 5, 2025.) If it is *not* explicitly mentioned when checked by Metataculus on or after July 1, 2025, this resolves as **No**.\n\nIn order to streamline resolution, synonyms will not count; the phrase must specifically be \"snack foods.\" The question will resolve as soon as the page is accessed by Metaculus Admins on the resolution date. However, if there are issues accessing the page, then resolution will wait up to the end of the question resolutions period, at which point if Metaculus has still not been able to access the resolution source, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe current U.S. Secretary of Agriculture is Brooke Rollins, who was sworn in around February 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
