    "review": "Both forecasters arrived independently at 18%, using essentially the same framework and evidence I identified. Their analyses are thorough and well-reasoned. They emphasize points I also identified: House opposition through concrete legislative action (HB 46 passage 118-16, substitute SB 3), the compressed 12-day timeline, strong economic/public opinion headwinds, Abbott's lack of public prioritization, and the structural requirement that only Abbott can call a special session. Forecaster 3's emphasis on 'institutional resistance from one chamber' as a 'powerful signal' is well-taken, and Forecaster 2's point about the 'procedural complexity' of reconciling chamber differences reinforces the timeline constraints. The fact that both independently reached 18% (vs my 15%) suggests I may have been slightly overconfident in the No outcome. However, I don't see fundamentally new evidence that would justify a large update.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the convergence at 18% by both forecasters suggests I may have underweighted certain factors. While 12 days is very tight for such contentious legislation, it's not impossible with determined leadership - and the Senate's 25-6 vote does demonstrate real political will. Lt. Gov. Patrick's commitment appears genuine. However, I still weight the House's concrete actions heavily - they didn't just express preference rhetorically, they passed alternative legislation 118-16 and created a substitute bill that explicitly avoids a full ban. This is institutional resistance, not just hesitation. The economic incentives ($8 billion industry), public opinion (62% support legalization), and Abbott's silence remain significant factors. The special session pathway exists but requires Abbott to act on an issue he hasn't prioritized. I'm updating up slightly from 15% to 17% to acknowledge the reasonable consensus around 18% and to avoid overconfidence, but maintaining that the structural barriers and demonstrated House opposition make a Yes outcome quite unlikely in the 47-day window remaining until July 1.",
