    "review": "Forecaster 2 raises a critical piece of evidence I had not fully weighted: Q4 2024 earnings were announced in late February 2025 but did NOT appear on Virgin Galactic's News page. This is highly significant because it demonstrates that quarterly earnings—the most predictable corporate announcement—are not consistently posted to this specific webpage. This directly undermines my concern that Q1 2025 earnings might trigger a May post. Forecaster 3 makes similar observations about the IR vs. News page separation but remains more conservative at 62%. Both forecasters correctly identify that the 13-week gap includes an earnings cycle that passed without a News page update, which strengthens the case for continued silence. Forecaster 2's 80% seems well-calibrated given this evidence, though perhaps slightly high given tail risks of unexpected announcements. Forecaster 3's 62% may be overly cautious—the earnings evidence is quite damning for the 'they'll post in May' thesis.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the most important evidence is that Q4 earnings in late February were not posted to the News page. This fundamentally changes my assessment because I had assigned meaningful probability to Q1 earnings being a trigger for a May post. If the News page is separate from investor relations announcements, the most reliable catalyst for a post is eliminated. The 13-week silence from January 30 to April 29 now becomes even more telling—it spans an entire quarterly earnings cycle without a post. This suggests the News page is reserved for operational milestones, strategic announcements, or major developments, not routine corporate updates. Given Virgin Galactic's transitional phase with the Delta-class fleet and paused commercial operations, such announcements are less likely. However, I'm not moving to 80% because: (1) unexpected announcements remain possible (partnerships, technical breakthroughs, strategic pivots), (2) a 4-month silence would be extraordinarily long even for a quiet company, potentially triggering some communication, and (3) tail risk management suggests leaving room for surprises. I'm updating from 70% to 76%, reflecting increased confidence due to the earnings evidence while maintaining appropriate humility about unknown unknowns.",
