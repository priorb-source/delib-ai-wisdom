  "information": "The recall was initiated by Johnsonville LLC on April 5, 2025, for approximately 22,672 pounds of its cheddar bratwurst product due to potential contamination with hard plastic. The affected products were produced on a single date, February 5, 2025, and bear the establishment number 'Est. 1647'. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) classified this as a Class I recall, indicating a high health risk. The recall was prompted by two consumer complaints, but no confirmed injuries have been reported. The product was distributed to retail locations in ten states: Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wisconsin. The FSIS has noted concerns that the product may still be in consumers' freezers.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 52 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the recall is currently Active; if nothing changes, it will still be Active on July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS effectiveness checks take longer than expected or the recall is expanded (e.g., additional lots/dates or states), keeping the status Active through July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Johnsonville completes recall effectiveness checks and product is verified out of commerce; FSIS updates the page from Active to Closed in mid-to-late June.",
    "rationale": "Evidence and base rates: The recall (Apr 5, 2025) involves ~22,672 lbs of cheddar bratwurst from a single production date (Feb 5, 2025), Class I due to hard plastic, distributed to 10 states. No injuries reported; two complaints triggered the action. For FSIS Class I recalls of a single-day lot with moderate distribution, many close within roughly 6–12 weeks once effectiveness checks confirm product is out of commerce. July 1 is 87 days post-initiation, which sits comfortably within that historical window. Drivers toward closure: single production date, modest scope, experienced firm (Johnsonville), and no reported injuries suggest straightforward verification and a clean root cause. These factors point to a high likelihood of closure by late June. Risks to closure: multi-state retail distribution can slow verification; FSIS may retain Active status if checks are incomplete. The risk of recall expansion (e.g., if new complaints suggest other production dates or supplier issues) could reset timelines. Seasonal grill usage in late May/June could surface more complaints, increasing expansion risk. Also, administrative lags in updating the FSIS page near quarter-end could push the visible status past July 1 even if operationally complete. Status quo weighting: The status is currently Active; giving some weight to inertia and the possibility of delays/expansions pulls the estimate down from a higher base-rate prior. Why not higher: real risks of expansion, multi-state verification drag, and page-update timing keep this from the 80–85% range. Why not lower: the recall’s limited scope (single date/lot), absence of injuries, and typical FSIS timelines make closure within ~3 months more likely than not. What would move the forecast up: explicit FSIS updates indicating effectiveness checks nearing completion; lack of any expansion or new complaints by early/mid-June; retailer/firm confirmation of product retrieval. What would move it down: any recall expansion, additional affected codes/dates, reports of injuries, or FSIS notes suggesting complex root cause or slow verification progress.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
