  "information": "As of April 30, 2025, the official UN OCHA impact snapshot reported 295 UN staff fatalities in Gaza. Reports from late April cited UNRWA stating that 295 of its personnel had died since October 7, 2023. This number reflects a steady increase over time; a UN report on March 19, 2025, had stated at least 280 UN employees were killed, and an OCHA report cited on January 9, 2025, listed 263 UNRWA staff fatalities. Broader figures for humanitarian workers indicate a higher total toll; an OCHA report on April 23, 2025, stated that at least 418 humanitarian workers, including the 295 UN staff, had been killed in Gaza since the conflict began. A specific incident on March 23, 2025, resulted in the deaths of 15 humanitarian personnel, including staff from the Palestinian Red Crescent and one UN staff member.\n\nThe United Nations has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza, exacerbated by a blockade that severely restricts access to aid, food, water, and medical supplies. In early May 2025, UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher called the aid blockade a form of 'cruel collective punishment,' noting that over 3,000 aid trucks were stalled at the border. According to OCHA reports from late April and early May 2025, insecurity and access restrictions have compelled humanitarian organizations to close nutrition centers. The same reports indicated an 80% rise in children being treated for malnutrition and that 65% of residents lack access to clean drinking water. The UN Population Fund also announced it had exhausted its supply of emergency shelter materials and hygiene products.\n\nOn May 5, 2025, Israel's security cabinet reportedly approved a plan to intensify military operations in the Gaza Strip. This follows a period of renewed violence since a ceasefire broke down in mid-March 2025. The UN has described Gaza as one of the most dangerous places in the world for humanitarian workers, with its personnel and facilities at risk from military activity. The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has stated that humanitarian efforts are severely hindered by severe restrictions on movement within the territory. The International Red Cross also noted that the deteriorating security situation is hindering the work of its staff and partners.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "57 days (from May 5, 2025 to July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - the current count of 295 UN staff fatalities is below the 300 threshold",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Fewer than 5 additional UN staff are killed between now and July 1, 2025. This could occur if a ceasefire is negotiated following the intensified military operations, if UN agencies significantly scale back their presence in Gaza due to security concerns, or if improved security protocols substantially reduce exposure to danger.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "5 or more additional UN staff are killed in the remaining 57 days. Given Israel's security cabinet approval of intensified military operations on May 5, 2025, continued violence and dangerous operating conditions lead to additional fatalities. A single large-scale incident similar to March 23, 2025 (which killed 15 humanitarian workers including UN staff) could easily exceed the threshold.",
    "rationale": "The current count stands at 295 UN staff fatalities as of April 30, 2025, requiring only 5 additional deaths to reach the 300 threshold. The historical trend shows an accelerating death rate: between January 9 and March 19 (70 days), 17 UN staff were killed (0.24 per day); between March 19 and April 30 (42 days), 15 were killed (0.36 per day). At the recent rate of 0.36 deaths/day, we would expect approximately 20 deaths over the remaining 57 days, substantially exceeding the 5 needed. Even at the slower earlier rate, we'd expect around 14 deaths. The timing is particularly concerning: Israel's security cabinet just approved intensified military operations today (May 5), the ceasefire broke down in mid-March, and the UN describes Gaza as one of the most dangerous places for humanitarian workers. The March 23 incident demonstrates that a single event can cause multiple fatalities. The worsening humanitarian crisis, with aid blockades and restricted access, keeps UN staff operating in hazardous conditions. I'm not forecasting higher (85%+) because there remains possibility of rapid de-escalation, ceasefire negotiations, or significant UN withdrawal that could reduce exposure. I'm not forecasting lower (below 70%) because the threshold is remarkably low - just 5 more deaths - and all current indicators point to continued or intensifying danger with no evidence of improving security conditions. The recent acceleration in fatality rates and today's announcement of intensified operations strongly suggest the threshold will be crossed.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill 300 or more UN staff be reported to be killed in Gaza according to UN's OCHA in its final impact snapshot before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nSee accompanying Humanitarian update [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-284-gaza-strip).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of reported UN staff killed in Gaza is greater than or equal to 300 according to the most recent impact snapshot for the Gaza Strip posted [here](https://www.ochaopt.org/publications) by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs as of July 1, 2025.
