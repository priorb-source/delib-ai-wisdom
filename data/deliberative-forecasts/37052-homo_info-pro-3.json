    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the fundamental tension of this question: a high base rate of recent coups in the African Sahel region is constrained by a very short two-month timeframe. Forecaster 3's attempt to quantify this base rate was a helpful exercise, and my own calculation based on the provided data suggested a probability slightly higher than my initial forecast. The most influential new piece of information came from Forecaster 2, who highlighted the very recent *foiled* coup attempts in Burkina Faso (April 2025) and Chad (January 2025). I had not sufficiently weighted this specific evidence. These failed attempts are a powerful signal that the conditions and intent for coups are not just a historical trend but an acute, ongoing threat in the present moment.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast of 30% was based on the high frequency of successful coups in Africa's Sahel region since 2020, balanced against the short time remaining until the question resolves. The analyses from the other forecasters have reinforced this core reasoning but convinced me to slightly increase my estimate. \n\nThe key factor for this update is the evidence, noted by Forecaster 2, of recently foiled coup attempts in the first part of 2025. This indicates that coup plotting is an active and current phenomenon in the region, raising the immediate risk above a simple historical average. Furthermore, following Forecaster 3's methodology, I performed my own base rate calculation using the list of successful coups provided in the prompt (7 successful coups in the 3 years between August 2020 and August 2023, for a rate of ~2.3/year). Applying this rate to the remaining ~2.2-month period suggests a probability of around 35%.\n\nPreviously, I might have discounted this raw calculation due to the inherent randomness and rarity of such events on any given day. However, the confirmation of active, recent plots convinces me that we are in a period of heightened risk, and the calculated base rate is a more accurate reflection of the current environment. Therefore, I am updating my forecast upward from 30% to 35%.",
