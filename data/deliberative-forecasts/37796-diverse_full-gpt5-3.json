    "review": "Both forecasters lean heavily on the very strong base rate (only one plenary with no changes since 2018) and identify the same two main pathways: Mozambique removal (post–April on‑site) and a BVI addition (post‑grace period, with UK not opposing). They add little new factual information beyond what I already considered, but Forecaster 2 emphasizes how unlikely it would be for both Mozambique’s removal and BVI’s addition to stall simultaneously, which is a useful framing. Forecaster 3’s caution about timelines (Nigeria and South Africa) and on‑site success standards is sensible and matches my earlier reservations. I find their reasoning largely convincing; the base-rate argument plus at least two credible, independent paths to change supports a slightly higher probability than my initial 85%.",
    "rationale": "Base rates suggest ~94% chance of some change. Specifics: (1) Mozambique appears well‑positioned for removal given reported completion of reforms and an April 2025 on‑site with positive indications; in typical sequencing, that sets up a June delisting. (2) BVI has a credible path to addition following the expired grace period and significant deficiencies, with the UK signaling it won’t obstruct—process risk remains but the setup is favorable. Other candidates (Nigeria, South Africa) are less likely for June due to timing (on‑site sequencing and stated targets), but they add optionality. A No outcome would likely require both a deferral of Mozambique’s removal and a delay in BVI’s listing, with no other surprises—possible but not the modal outcome. I’m nudging upward to reflect multiple plausible Yes paths plus strong historical precedent, while retaining some discount for process/agenda slippage and the chance Mozambique’s on‑site isn’t deemed fully satisfactory or that BVI is queued to October.",
