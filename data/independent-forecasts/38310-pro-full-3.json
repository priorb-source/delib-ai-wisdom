  "information": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney formally invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the G7 summit scheduled for June 15-17, 2025, in Kananaskis, Alberta. The invitation was extended in March 2025. On May 27, 2025, Zelenskyy confirmed his intention to go, stating to Ukrainian journalists, \"G7: I was invited by the Canadian Prime Minister Carney. And I will be.\" Canadian security planning documents list Zelenskyy among the expected attendees, prompting preparations including a no-fly-zone over the area.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2024, Volodymyr Zelenskyy participated in three G7 summits: he attended the 2023 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, in person, and attended the 2022 summit in Elmau, Germany, and the 2024 summit in Apulia, Italy, virtually. Throughout the war, he has made numerous international trips, including visits to Washington, Paris, and Davos. On June 2, 2025, he arrived in Vilnius, Lithuania, to attend the Bucharest Nine summit ahead of the NATO summit scheduled for June 24-25 in The Hague.\n\nA key topic of discussion related to the G7 summit is the potential for new sanctions against Russia. US Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal have advocated for a new package of sanctions to be coordinated with European allies before the summit. However, according to news reports citing EU diplomats, it is unlikely that the European Union will have a new sanctions package ready by mid-June. President Zelenskyy has publicly called for increased pressure on Russia and for joint sanctions to be agreed upon at the G7 level.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "12-14 days. The G7 summit is scheduled for June 15-17, 2025, and today's date is June 3, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "President Zelenskyy will attend the G7 summit in person, as he has publicly accepted the invitation and Canadian authorities are making security preparations for his arrival.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, major Russian military offensive in Ukraine forces President Zelenskyy to cancel his international travel to manage the crisis from Kyiv. Alternatively, a specific, credible security threat against his travel or the summit venue emerges, leading security advisors to recommend against his in-person attendance.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "President Zelenskyy follows through on his public commitment, travels from Europe to Canada, and arrives in Kananaskis to attend the G7 summit in person from June 15-17.",
    "rationale": "The evidence strongly supports the conclusion that President Zelenskyy will attend the summit. The most significant factors are his own unambiguous public statement on May 27, 2025, confirming his attendance ('I will be'), and the fact that the host nation, Canada, is actively making security preparations for his in-person arrival. His established precedent of traveling internationally for high-stakes diplomatic events throughout the war, including his current trip to Lithuania and past in-person attendance at the 2023 G7 in Japan, demonstrates both his willingness and capability to make such trips. Attending the G7 is of paramount strategic importance for Ukraine to lobby for continued military, financial, and political support. The status quo is a clear trajectory toward his attendance.\n\nThe probability is not 100% due to the inherent volatility of leading a country at war. A significant, unforeseen military escalation or a direct, credible security threat could force a last-minute cancellation. While discussions about the pace of new sanctions are ongoing, it is highly improbable that this would be a sufficient reason for him to cancel, as the personal diplomatic opportunity afforded by the summit outweighs any single policy disagreement. The probability is not lower because his public commitment is a very strong signal, and reversing it would require an event of major significance, for which there are currently no indicators. My forecast would decrease if there were reports of a major new Russian offensive or a specific security threat. It would increase if Ukrainian or Canadian officials reconfirmed his travel plans closer to the summit date.",
