    "review": "All three forecasters converged remarkably on 75-76%, which suggests strong agreement on the key factors. Forecaster 3 raised the most important new consideration I hadn't explicitly addressed: the compound probability mathematics. Even with high daily reliability (say 97%), over 30 consecutive days the probability drops significantly (0.97^30 ≈ 40%). This is crucial for understanding how the 'every day' requirement dramatically reduces the overall probability compared to 'will Kalshi offer markets in June generally.' Forecaster 3 also made a valuable point about geofencing as a middle-ground regulatory response to Nevada-specific legal action, rather than nationwide suspension. This somewhat mitigates the legal risk, though doesn't eliminate it. Forecaster 2's emphasis on technical outages as an additional failure mode beyond legal/regulatory action reinforces that multiple independent risk sources compound over 30 days. All forecasters correctly identified the strong status quo inertia (6-week track record, 80% weekend volume, clear financial incentives) as the baseline, with legal/regulatory uncertainty and operational perfection requirements as the primary counterweights.",
    "rationale": "The compound probability argument is mathematically compelling and I should have made it more explicit. However, I believe I had implicitly factored this into my assessment when emphasizing the strictness of the 'every day' requirement. The convergence at 75-76% across all three forecasters suggests we're properly calibrated on balancing the strong status quo against meaningful tail risks. The geofencing insight slightly reduces my concern about the Nevada case causing nationwide disruption, but doesn't eliminate legal uncertainty entirely. We're forecasting from May 31, giving us no visibility into June performance. The base case remains very strong: established operations, prime baseball season, powerful financial incentives. But requiring 30 consecutive days of perfect execution across legal, regulatory, technical, and operational dimensions justifies keeping the forecast below 80%. I'm not updating my forecast because I believe my original 75% appropriately weighted these factors, and the new arguments reinforced rather than shifted my reasoning.",
