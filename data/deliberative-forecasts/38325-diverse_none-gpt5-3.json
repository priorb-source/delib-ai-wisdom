    "review": "Forecaster 2 rightly emphasizes how close -0.3% is to zero and that revisions can be large enough to flip the sign. However, their 0.5–0.6 pp “typical” advance-to-third absolute revision looks a bit high versus BEA documentation (more like ~0.4–0.5 pp on average), and using that to justify a >50% probability overweights the chance of a positive revision of sufficient size. With roughly symmetric revisions, the probability that the revision is both positive and >0.3 pp is closer to ~25–35%, not >50%.\n\nForecaster 3 is directionally aligned with my prior view that sign flips are uncommon, but their 0.5–1.0 pp “typical” range overstates the central tendency of revisions. Their 30% headline is plausible given a small negative starting point and symmetric, modestly sized revisions.\n\nBoth correctly note the second estimate would be the key update; absent that, the base case leans ‘No’.",
    "rationale": "Time left: about 3 weeks until the third estimate (late June). Status quo: advance at -0.3% implies ‘No’ unless an upward revision >0.3 pp occurs. A ‘No’ outcome results if revisions are small or negative; a ‘Yes’ outcome requires a positive revision ≥0.4 pp.\n\nEmpirics: Advance-to-third revisions are roughly mean-zero with mean absolute size around 0.4–0.5 pp. A simple normal approximation (sd ~0.5–0.6 pp) gives P(revision > +0.3) ≈ 27–31%. Composition could tilt risk slightly upward if the weakness was inventories/net exports with solid domestic demand, but without the second estimate or detailed March source data, that’s speculative.\n\nGiven the lack of new evidence, I continue to weight the initial negative reading most, with a nontrivial but sub-50% chance of a flip. Forecaster 2’s 55% seems to over-infer from revision magnitudes; Forecaster 3’s 30% aligns with a symmetric-revision view. I hold at roughly 30%.",
