  "information": "The legal process to ban a political party in Germany requires an application to be submitted to the Federal Constitutional Court by the federal government, the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat. The court must then rule that the party aims to undermine the democratic order. Historically, only two parties have been banned in post-WWII Germany: the Socialist Reich Party (SRP) in 1952 and the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1956. A 2017 attempt to ban the far-right NPD party failed. As of early May 2025, no formal application to ban the AfD had been filed with the Constitutional Court. Separately, Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV) has classified the AfD as a 'proven right-wing extremist organization,' which permits state surveillance.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "No authorized filing to the Federal Constitutional Court occurs, or even if filed, the Court does not rule before July 1. Political processes continue (debate, surveillance by BfV), but no official ban is announced.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A filing is made immediately by the federal government, Bundestag, or Bundesrat and, in a historically unprecedented move, the Federal Constitutional Court issues and announces a party ban on an emergency, expedited basis before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "- Process and timing: Under Germany’s Basic Law, only the Federal Constitutional Court can ban a political party, and only after an application by the federal government, Bundestag, or Bundesrat. Such cases have historically taken years. The 2017 NPD case (which failed) took roughly 3–4 years from application to decision. With about two months left, an official ban announcement is extraordinarily unlikely.\n- Current status: As of early May 2025, per the research assistant, no formal application to ban the AfD has been filed. A Bundestag debate and a cross-party motion from 124 MPs are far short of the majority needed to initiate proceedings; even if a filing occurred immediately, a decision before July 1 would be unprecedented.\n- Precedent and rarity: Only two postwar party bans (SRP 1952, KPD 1956), none since. The Federal Constitutional Court has shown high caution in party-ban cases. The BfV’s classification of AfD as a proven extremist organization increases surveillance powers but does not equate to, or rapidly lead to, a ban.\nWhy not higher: The compressed timeline, lack of a filed case, the Court’s deliberate pace, and political hurdles make a pre–July 1 ban announcement extraordinarily unlikely.\nWhy not lower: I leave a very small probability for extreme, unforeseen catalysts (e.g., a major security crisis credibly tied to party leadership) that could prompt a filing and an unprecedentedly fast ruling. Even then, constitutional and procedural norms make such acceleration highly improbable.\nWhat would move my forecast up: A formal, jointly supported filing by the federal government/Bundestag/Bundesrat plus a public signal from the Constitutional Court of an expedited calendar would raise odds, though still likely below a few percent given timing. What would move it down: Passing more time without a filing; public statements from key actors signaling no intent to file; or court indications that no expedited track is possible.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Germany ban the AfD before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nLe Monde: [Germany's Bundestag debates banning far-right AfD party](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/01/31/germany-s-bundestag-debates-banning-far-right-afd-party_6737637_4.html) \"A cross-party group of 124 MPs put a motion on the agenda to bring proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court to ban the party, whose unprecedented alliance with the CDU caused a shock.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there is an official announcement of a ban on the Alternative for Germany (AfD) by a German government entity with the authority to make such an announcement (e.g., the Federal Constitutional Court).\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe legal process to ban a political party in Germany requires an application to be submitted to the Federal Constitutional Court by the federal government, the Bundestag, or the Bundesrat.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
