    "review": "All three forecasters correctly identify the extremely short timeframe (~45 days) as the dominant factor, making the status quo 'No' outcome highly likely. My initial reasoning aligns very closely with Forecaster 2's, who also emphasizes the lack of public signals and the lengthy nature of IPO preparations. Their slightly higher forecast of 4% (versus my initial 2%) is reasonable, perhaps giving a bit more weight to the low-bar resolution criterion of a simple news post. Forecaster 3's jump to 10% is less convincing; while they acknowledge the arguments for 'No', their justification for the higher probability rests on the idea that Anthropic might make a strategic announcement now to position for a later debut. I find this unpersuasive, as there's no clear strategic benefit to making such a market-moving announcement within this specific and arbitrary time window without any prior groundwork.",
    "rationale": "I am slightly increasing my forecast from 2% to 3%. The core of my reasoning remains unchanged: the primary driver for this forecast is the extremely short time until the resolution date combined with a complete lack of any public signals that an IPO announcement is imminent. The process of preparing for an IPO, including the S-1 filing, is intensive and typically takes many months, making that path to a 'Yes' resolution almost impossible. However, the deliberation with the other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 2, reinforced the importance of the second resolution criterion: a simple announcement on the company's news page. This has a much lower logistical bar than a regulatory filing. While I still believe a surprise announcement of this magnitude is strategically unlikely, I am nudging my probability upward to better reflect this non-zero possibility. This small adjustment acknowledges the alternate resolution path without adopting what I view as the overly optimistic 10% forecast from Forecaster 3.",
