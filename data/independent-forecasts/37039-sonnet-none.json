    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 38 days until June 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The status quo appears to be that Trump has recently announced or implemented tariffs on Switzerland. Based on the April 4, 2025 NYT article referenced, Switzerland has been placed on a tariff list. If these tariffs were implemented in early April as suggested, they would likely remain in effect through June 1 unless actively changed.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The 31% tariff on Switzerland is not implemented by June 1, either because: (1) the announcement was not followed by actual implementation in the harmonized tariff schedule, (2) Switzerland successfully negotiates an exemption or reduction before June 1, (3) the tariff is suspended or modified due to political pressure or legal challenges, or (4) the specific rate ends up being different from 31% or listed under a different subheading.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Trump administration follows through on the announced tariffs, formally implementing a 31% additional duty on Swiss products in the harmonized tariff schedule under subheading 9903.01.60, and this tariff remains in place through June 1, 2025. The tariff survives any diplomatic negotiations or legal challenges in the 38-day window.",
    "rationale": "The April 4, 2025 NYT article strongly suggests that Trump has placed Switzerland on a tariff list, indicating this is an active policy development rather than speculation. The headline mentioning Switzerland being 'indignant' about making a 'top 10' list implies concrete action has been taken. Trump has historically been aggressive on tariffs and often followed through on announcements. The 38-day timeline is relatively short, which typically favors the status quo - once tariffs are implemented, they tend to remain for at least several months before modifications. However, several factors introduce uncertainty: (1) The research assistant provided no additional confirmation about whether the 31% rate has actually been codified in the harmonized tariff schedule yet, (2) The question is extremely specific about the exact percentage and subheading number, which could mean it's based on actual policy language but also leaves room for technical differences in implementation, (3) Switzerland could negotiate modifications or exemptions given their strong diplomatic relationships, (4) Tariff policies can be modified more quickly than most legislation. My forecast is not higher because: we lack confirmation of current implementation status, international pressure could lead to modifications, and the specificity required (exact 31% at exact subheading) creates technical risk. My forecast is not lower because: the NYT article indicates real policy action, Trump's track record on tariffs, and the short timeline favors status quo. I would update higher with confirmation that 31% at subheading 9903.01.60 is already live in the system, or with official administration statements confirming this exact specification. I would update lower with news of negotiations yielding exemptions, legal challenges gaining traction, or administration signals of policy reversal.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tariff schedule list the tariff on Switzerland as 31% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Swiss Indignant to Make the Top 10 of Trump’s Tariffs List](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/trump-tariffs-switzerland.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 31% for Switzerland at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=switzerland) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this question is asking whether the cell in the 'RATES OF DUTY' column '1, General' appearing alongside subheading 9903.01.60 on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule indicates an additional ad valorem duty rate of 31% for articles the product of Switzerland, regardless of any specificities noted in the 'Article Description' column.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
