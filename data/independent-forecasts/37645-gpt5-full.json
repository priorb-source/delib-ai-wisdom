  "information": "Student-led protests demanding the immediate dissolution of parliament and early elections have been ongoing in Serbia for over six months, originating from a tragic canopy collapse in Novi Sad in November 2024. Protestors threatened to escalate their actions if their demands were not met by mid-May. A survey conducted by the CRTA research center indicated that 59% of Serbian citizens support the students' actions. However, reports also suggest that the momentum of the protests has been waning and the political opposition remains fragmented.\n\nIn response to protests, government officials have maintained that there is no need for early elections. Vice-Premier Ivica Dačić stated that the ruling coalition has a 'stable majority' in parliament. Following the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, President Aleksandar Vučić announced that a decision would be made within ten days on whether to form a new government or hold elections. More recently, a May 14, 2025 article quoted Vučić saying the party would again decide 'within ten days' whether to form another new cabinet or go to the polls.\n\nFollowing the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, a constitutional deadline was triggered, requiring the formation of a new government to avoid a mandatory snap election. According to multiple wire-service reports from March and April 2025, a new government successfully won a confidence vote in the Serbian parliament in mid-April. This event removed the automatic, constitutionally-mandated trigger for snap elections before the summer.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No announcement of a general election date before July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The newly installed government from mid-April continues to govern; protests keep waning and the ruling coalition maintains discipline. Without dissolving parliament, no decree setting an election date is issued before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A political shock (coalition split, major scandal, sharp protest escalation, or external pressure) prompts President Vučić to dissolve parliament and issue an official decree setting a specific election date (likely in late summer/early fall), and that decree is published before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Baseline/status quo: Multiple reports indicate a new government won a confidence vote in mid-April 2025, removing the constitutional trigger for mandatory snap elections. Senior officials (e.g., Vice-PM Dačić) say there is no need for early elections and claim a stable majority. This strongly points to no near-term announcement.\n- Timing mechanics: In Serbia, an official election date is typically set via dissolution with elections held 45–60 days afterward. Announcing now would imply elections in late July/August—an unattractive window due to summer holidays and historically uncommon timing—further reducing odds of an announcement by July 1 if the intent is to vote in the fall.\n- Protests: Student-led protests have lasted ~6 months with majority public sympathy per CRTA (59%), but reports suggest momentum is waning and the opposition is fragmented. That weakens the pressure for immediate snap polls.\n- Vučić’s signaling: While he has at times said a decision would come “within ten days,” the formation of a government in April suggests those statements were either pre-formation leverage or ongoing tactical ambiguity. He is known to call elections opportunistically, so the probability is not zero, but the incentives right now favor consolidation over risk.\n- Why not higher: Fresh government just formed; no constitutional compulsion; summer timing is poor; protests ebbing; ruling majority cohesive per official statements.\n- Why not lower: Serbia’s recent history of frequent snap elections and Vučić’s tactical flexibility leave room for a sudden pivot if a crisis erupts or if he perceives a favorable electoral window. A negotiated concession to protesters or international pressure could accelerate an announcement even for a later election date, provided a formal decree sets the date.\n- What would move the forecast up: Credible reports of coalition fracture or key resignations; large, sustained protest escalation; a major scandal; EU or international pressure tied to a concrete commitment to new elections; clear presidential signaling of imminent dissolution.\n- What would move it down: Continued calm; explicit, repeated denials paired with a firm governing agenda; scheduling or focus on non-parliamentary elections; lack of any legal step toward dissolution by mid-June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Serbia announce a general election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Serbia could face snap elections as PM’s resignation confirmed](https://tvpworld.com/85681783/serbia-could-face-snap-elections-as-pms-resignation-confirmed-)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a general election will be held is officially announced by the government of Serbia or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nStudent-led protests demanding the immediate dissolution of parliament and early elections have been ongoing in Serbia for over six months, originating from a tragic canopy collapse in Novi Sad in November 2024.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
