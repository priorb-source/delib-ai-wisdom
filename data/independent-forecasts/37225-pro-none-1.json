    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than one month. The election is scheduled for May 25, 2025, and results are expected shortly after.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The Progressive Reform Party (VHP) holds a plurality of seats (20 out of 51) in the National Assembly following the 2020 election and leads the current coalition government.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Widespread public dissatisfaction with the Santokhi government's unpopular IMF-backed austerity measures and persistent high inflation causes a significant erosion of support for the VHP. Another party, such as the VHP's coalition partner ABOP or a surprisingly resilient National Democratic Party (NDP), successfully capitalizes on this anti-incumbent sentiment to win more seats.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Despite economic hardship and declining popularity, the VHP retains a plurality of seats because the opposition is fundamentally weak and fragmented. The main opposition party, the NDP, is crippled by the fugitive status of its leader, Dési Bouterse, which severely undermines its campaign. No other single party manages to consolidate enough support to overtake the VHP, allowing it to win the most seats, even if its total is reduced from 2020.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the assessment that the opposition's weakness currently outweighs the incumbent government's unpopularity. The status quo is that the Progressive Reform Party (VHP) is the largest party with 20 seats. While their economic policies have been painful and have led to protests and low approval ratings, creating a significant headwind, their primary challenger is in disarray. The National Democratic Party (NDP), which won 16 seats in 2020, is led by Dési Bouterse, who is a convicted murderer and a fugitive from justice. It is exceptionally difficult for a party to mount a successful national campaign when its leader is in hiding and discredited on the international stage. This leadership crisis creates a political vacuum that the VHP is positioned to benefit from, even by default. While other parties like the ABOP (a current coalition partner) may gain seats by criticizing the government from within, it is a high bar for them to leapfrog the VHP to become the single largest party. Therefore, the most probable scenario is that the VHP secures a plurality, not necessarily through a wave of popular support, but because there is no sufficiently strong and unified alternative.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 65% because the economic pain felt by Surinamese voters is real and potent. A strong anti-incumbent wave could consolidate behind an alternative party in the final weeks of the campaign, or voter apathy could disproportionately harm the VHP's turnout, leading to an upset. The performance of Vice President Ronnie Brunswijk's ABOP is a key variable with high uncertainty.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 65% because the structural weakness of the NDP is a severe handicap that is difficult to overcome. Without a credible, popular leader at the helm, mobilizing a winning coalition is a monumental task. The VHP, as the incumbent party, still commands the machinery of government and can frame the narrative around the necessity of their reforms to clean up the economic mismanagement of the previous Bouterse administration.\n\nI would update my forecast downwards if credible polling emerged showing a significant surge for a single opposition party, or if the NDP successfully coalesced around a new, untainted leader. I would update upwards if the opposition fell into further infighting or if there were positive economic news that eased voter concerns just before the election.",
