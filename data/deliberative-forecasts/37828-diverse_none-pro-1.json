    "review": "The other two forecasters and I are in strong agreement on the core elements of the problem: the very short timeframe (~40 days) and the complete lack of public signals (media leaks, reports of underwriter hiring) are powerful indicators for a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 3 introduced two excellent points I hadn't fully weighed. First, the seasonality, noting that summer is a less common period for IPO filings than the fall. Second, and more importantly, they analyzed the resolution criteria, observing that an announcement on the company's news page without a simultaneous S-1 filing is highly unlikely due to 'quiet period' regulations. This effectively means the question boils down to 'Will Rippling file a public S-1 before July 1?'. This logical step makes a surprise announcement even less probable. Despite making these points which argue for a lower probability, both forecasters landed on higher probabilities than my initial 5% (at 8% and 9% respectively). This suggests they are putting more weight than I did on the possibility of a stealthy, well-prepared company surprising the market, given Rippling's maturity and the relatively open IPO window.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am making a minor upward adjustment to my forecast. My initial reasoning was heavily based on the short timeline and lack of any affirmative evidence. Forecaster 3's points about seasonality and the resolution mechanics being tied to an S-1 filing actually strengthen my conviction that a 'Yes' outcome is unlikely. However, both other experts, despite acknowledging these same negative factors, settled on higher probabilities of 8% and 9%. This consensus suggests I may have been slightly underweighting the 'unknown unknown' factor – the possibility that a mature, private company like Rippling has conducted its IPO preparations in complete secrecy and is ready to file on short notice. While I find their final probabilities a bit high given the headwinds, their confidence has persuaded me to slightly increase the possibility of a surprise. I am moving my forecast from 5% to 6%. This reflects a small concession to their view while maintaining my core thesis that the lack of public signals in such a short window is the dominant piece of evidence.",
