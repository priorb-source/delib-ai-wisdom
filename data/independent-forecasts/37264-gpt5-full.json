  "information": "The U.S. State Department uses a four-level travel advisory system: Level 1 (Exercise Normal Precautions), Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution), Level 3 (Reconsider Travel), and Level 4 (Do Not Travel). Advisories are issued based on risks such as crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and health concerns. Level 3 and Level 4 advisories are reviewed at least every six months. As of early May 2025, there were 21 countries with a Level 4 advisory, including Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen.\n\nAs of May 2, 2025, the U.S. State Department's travel advisory for Niger is Level 3, 'Reconsider Travel,' last updated on March 21, 2023. The stated reasons for the advisory are terrorism, kidnapping, crime, and civil unrest. While the nationwide advisory is Level 3, specific areas within Niger are designated as Level 4, 'Do Not Travel,' including the Diffa region, the Lake Chad basin, and regions bordering Mali. Neighboring countries, including Mali and Burkina Faso, have nationwide Level 4 advisories.\n\nRecent changes to Level 4 advisories for other nations have been linked to specific security deteriorations. The advisory for South Sudan was elevated to Level 4 on March 8, 2025, which coincided with the ordered departure of non-emergency U.S. government personnel from the capital, Juba. The Level 4 advisory for the Democratic Republic of Congo cites high levels of violent crime, including armed robbery and kidnapping. The State Department also applies Level 4 warnings to sub-regions within countries, such as several states in Mexico and the Gaza Strip, due to localized risks of crime and armed conflict.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the advisory remains Level 3 (Reconsider Travel) with specific border regions at Level 4.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Security trends remain roughly stable: insurgent activity stays concentrated outside Niamey, no major high-casualty incidents affecting foreigners or the capital, and the U.S. Embassy maintains current operations without an ordered departure. The State Department conducts a periodic review but leaves the nationwide advisory at Level 3 while retaining Level 4 restrictions for certain regions.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A clear deterioration triggers an update: e.g., a major terror attack or series of kidnappings impacting foreigners or the capital; significant civil unrest or protest violence; the U.S. orders departure of non-emergency embassy personnel or faces severe constraints on consular operations; or conflict spillovers from Mali/Burkina escalate markedly in central corridors. Any of these could justify elevating Niger to nationwide Level 4 before July 1.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: As of May 2, 2025, the U.S. advisory for Niger is Level 3 with several border areas at Level 4, while neighbors Mali and Burkina Faso are nationwide Level 4. The State Department reviews Level 3/4 advisories at least every six months, and currently lists 21 Level 4 countries, typically those with active conflict, extreme crime/terrorism, or severely limited consular support.\n\nWhy the status quo weighs heavily: Niger’s risk profile is serious but has been relatively concentrated in specific regions; Niamey has generally remained more stable. The State Department often uses Level 3 nationwide plus Level 4 sub-regions when risks are localized. Absent a sharp trigger (e.g., ordered departure, capital-targeted attacks), countries can remain at Level 3 for extended periods despite high-risk peripheries.\n\nWhat could push it to Level 4: Recent U.S.–Niger frictions (including U.S. troop withdrawal) increase the chance of reduced consular capacity or ordered departure—both historically associated with Level 4 moves (e.g., South Sudan). A high-profile incident impacting foreigners or the capital, or a notable surge in violence, could also prompt a swift elevation.\n\nWhy not higher: Many Level 4 countries are in open conflict or suffer pervasive violent crime across major urban centers; Niger’s risks, while serious, have often been geographically concentrated. There has not been a widely reported, recent step-change in capital-area risk. Without a clear trigger, a nationwide upgrade within a two-month window is not the base case.\n\nWhy not lower: The environment remains fragile; neighboring Sahel states are already Level 4; parts of Niger are Level 4. U.S.–Niger relations and security conditions could deteriorate quickly, so the tail risk is meaningful.\n\nWhat would move me up: An ordered or authorized departure of U.S. Embassy staff; a major terror/kidnapping incident in Niamey or affecting U.S. citizens; restrictions on embassy operations; declared nationwide emergency; significant cross-border escalation.\n\nWhat would move me down: Signs of stabilization and continued embassy normal operations; absence of major incidents; constructive U.S.–Niger security coordination that improves consular posture through June.\n\nSummary of assistant’s inputs used: Current level is 3 with Level 4 sub-regions; neighbors Mali/Burkina are Level 4; Level 4 changes often tied to clear security deterioration or ordered departure; reviews happen at least every six months; 21 countries are currently Level 4. These factors inform a modest but non-trivial probability of an upgrade within ~60 days.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any).
