    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Rippling remains a private company and makes no announcement regarding an IPO.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Rippling's leadership and board decide that market conditions are not optimal for an IPO in the near term, or that the company's strategic goals are better served by remaining private to continue its growth trajectory. The company continues to operate as it has, and the July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an S-1 filing or a formal announcement on its website.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Having been preparing for a public offering confidentially for months, Rippling's management sees a favorable window in the market and decides to act. Before July 1, 2025, the company either files its S-1 registration statement with the SEC or publishes a press release on its official news blog announcing its intention to go public.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the typically long and public lead-up to an Initial Public Offering. The status quo is that Rippling is a private company, and a shift to public requires significant, deliberate action. With the deadline of July 1, 2025, just over a month away, the absence of any public signals—such as reports of hiring investment bankers, widespread media speculation, or CEO interviews hinting at an IPO—is the strongest piece of evidence. IPOs are major corporate milestones that are rarely announced without a preceding build-up. The provided research material confirms there is no additional information, reinforcing the lack of these critical signals. While the background article notes the company is growing and its shares are gaining value in private markets, this is a common state for successful late-stage startups and does not, on its own, indicate an imminent IPO. Often, such companies prefer to stay private longer to avoid the scrutiny and quarterly pressures of public markets. Therefore, the most probable outcome is the continuation of the status quo.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 5% because a surprise announcement is not impossible. Rippling could have been pursuing a confidential filing process, and an announcement could come with little warning, even if this is not the typical path for a high-profile company.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 5% because the short timeframe makes an un-telegraphed announcement extremely unlikely. A higher probability would require some form of evidence or credible rumor, of which there is none.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible news sources (e.g., Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal) reported that Rippling had engaged underwriters or was on the verge of filing. I would decrease my forecast if Rippling announced another significant private funding round, which would signal its intent to remain private for the medium term.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Rippling announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Startup News: Shares of HR firm Rippling gain value as its business expands](https://forgeglobal.com/insights/blog/startup-news-shares-of-rippling-gain-value-as-its-business-expands/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Rippling, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.rippling.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
