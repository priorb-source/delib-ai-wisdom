    "review": "All three forecasts converge remarkably at 18-20%, suggesting strong agreement on the core analysis. We all recognize: (1) the dollar is at 3-year lows amid tariff turmoil, (2) reaching 0.80 EUR per USD would require an additional 7-12% depreciation in just 7 weeks, (3) such extreme moves are historically rare absent major crises, and (4) elevated volatility creates meaningful tail risk. Forecaster 3 raises an interesting contrarian point that being at 3-year lows might mean negative news is already priced in, suggesting mean reversion rather than continuation. However, this could cut both ways - momentum can persist in crisis scenarios. Forecaster 2's emphasis on central bank interventions is valid but may be less reliable in a trade war environment. The key insight from Forecaster 3 that we only need to 'touch' 0.80 briefly is important - this makes tail events slightly more probable than sustained levels would be. However, none of the forecasters provided information about the actual current exchange rate, which remains a critical unknown. The convergence of our forecasts provides some confidence we're in the right range, but we're all possibly anchoring too heavily on historical norms when current policy uncertainty is abnormal.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I find no compelling reason to significantly revise my forecast. The convergence at 18-20% validates that we're all assessing similar base rates, timeframes, and risk factors. The core logic remains: while dollar weakness and tariff volatility are real, moving from already-depressed levels (likely 0.87-0.92 EUR/USD) to below 0.80 in 7 weeks would require either a major escalation or economic crisis. Such moves are possible but remain low-probability events. The brief-touch criterion does increase probability slightly versus needing sustained levels, but not dramatically. The 'already priced in' argument has merit but doesn't definitively point in either direction. Currency markets can exhibit both mean reversion and momentum continuation. Without knowing the precise current rate, I cannot be more confident than the 15-25% range. Given the short timeframe acts as a natural brake on extreme outcomes, and historical rarity of such moves, 18% appropriately balances the elevated volatility risk against base rate expectations.",
