    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks. The outcome will be determined by data for June 2025, which will be accessed on or after July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Based on historical data for total sightings from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC), California frequently has a number of reports equal to or greater than Florida. Given the low number of pilot-specific reports, a tie is a plausible outcome, which would resolve this question as 'No'. Therefore, the status quo expectation is that another state will lead or tie with Florida.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "In June 2025, NUFORC logs one pilot report from California and one from Florida. Because Florida is tied with another state for the most reports, the question resolves as 'No'. Alternatively, California could log two reports while Florida logs one, also resulting in a 'No' outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A military aviator from one of Florida's numerous bases (e.g., Eglin AFB, NAS Jacksonville) reports a UAP during a training mission over the Gulf of Mexico in June 2025. This is the only pilot-originated report recorded by NUFORC from any US state for that month, making Florida the state with the most pilot sightings.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on an analysis of historical reporting trends from NUFORC and an evaluation of factors contributing to pilot-specific sightings. The resolution of this question hinges on a very small number of events—pilot sightings of UFOs—which introduces significant variance.\n\nHistorically, Florida and California are top contenders for the highest number of total UFO reports. In many months, California either leads or is very close to Florida's total. Since the status quo is that the world changes slowly, and California often leads, my baseline forecast favors a 'No' outcome. Furthermore, the resolution criteria states that a tie resolves as 'No', which statistically disadvantages the 'Yes' case.\n\nThe key variable for this specific question is the concentration of pilots. Both Florida and California have high volumes of commercial and military air traffic. However, Florida possesses extensive military training ranges off its coast (e.g., Eglin Gulf Test and Training Range) which have been prominent in recent, well-documented UAP encounters by military pilots. This concentration of military aviation activity is the strongest argument in favor of a 'Yes' outcome, as military pilots may be more likely to witness and report anomalous phenomena.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 25% because California remains a formidable competitor with its own significant aerospace and military presence. The high degree of randomness associated with such rare events (a specific type of report in a specific state in a specific month) and the 'no tie' rule make it statistically unlikely for any single state to be the sole leader.\n\nMy probability is not lower than 25% because Florida is unquestionably one of the top 2-3 most likely states to achieve this. Its prominent role in recent military UAP discussions and its dense, varied air traffic make it a very strong candidate, far more likely than the average US state.\n\nI would increase my forecast if I received credible information about specific, large-scale military or aerospace testing operations scheduled for Florida's airspace in June 2025. I would decrease it upon receiving similar news for a competing state like California or Texas, or if analysis of May 2025 data showed an unusual drop in Florida's reporting rate.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Florida have the most pilot sightings of UFOs of any US state in March 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAccording to the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/about-us/): \"The National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 180,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if The National UFO Reporting Center posts more pilot reports of a UFO/UAP having occurred in the state of Florida than any other state, for the month of June 2025 at [this link](https://nuforc.org/subndx/?id=x) when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\nIf Florida is tied with another state, resolves as No.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-21.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
