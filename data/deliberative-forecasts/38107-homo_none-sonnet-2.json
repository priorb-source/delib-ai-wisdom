    "review": "All three forecasts cluster tightly between 2-4%, demonstrating strong agreement on the core reasoning: extraordinarily low base rates for arresting former FBI directors, First Amendment protections, compressed timeline, and political sensitivity all point to very low probability. Forecaster 3 raises the most compelling new argument I hadn't fully considered: the temporal inference. Nearly two weeks (May 16 to May 30) have elapsed since the Secret Service investigation was publicly reported without any indication of escalation or imminent arrest. This is particularly significant because, as Forecaster 3 notes, the Secret Service typically acts swiftly when they identify credible threats to protected individuals. The lack of follow-up news or action suggests the investigation is either finding insufficient grounds for arrest or proceeding extremely slowly - both scenarios make arrest within the remaining 32 days even less likely. Forecaster 2's point about being in the 'asking' phase reinforces this - we're still at early investigatory stages, not near arrest. This temporal evidence should lower my probability slightly.",
    "rationale": "While my original 3% forecast captured the extremely low probability, Forecaster 3's temporal argument provides meaningful additional evidence. The passage of 14 days without escalation in a context where rapid action would be expected for genuine threats is informative. The Secret Service doesn't typically wait weeks to arrest individuals posing credible threats to presidents. Combined with the already-established factors (unprecedented nature of arresting a former FBI director, high legal bars for First Amendment cases, political sensitivity, compressed timeline), this strengthens the case for an even lower probability. However, I cannot go to 1% or below because: (1) the investigation remains active as far as we know, (2) 32 days is still a non-trivial window, (3) the 'any reason' clause maintains small tail risk, and (4) politically charged environments can produce unexpected outcomes. The 2% forecast appropriately reflects these dynamics while incorporating the new temporal evidence.",
