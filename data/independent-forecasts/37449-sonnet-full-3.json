  "information": "In April 2025, China conducted the \"Strait Thunder-2025A\" military exercises, which involved dozens of aircraft and warships. According to a spokesperson for the Chinese Eastern Theater Command, the operation aimed to test China's capabilities in \"controlling zones\" and \"blockading\" Taiwan, and included simulations of \"strikes on key ports and energy infrastructure.\" Following these and other drills, US military officials, including US Pacific Army Commander Ronald P. Clark and US Indo-Pacific Command Commander Admiral Samuel Paparo, stated that China's exercises simulating a blockade of Taiwan have become a \"regular occurrence\" and that Beijing is rehearsing the \"full spectrum of military operations.\"\n\nIn response to China's military exercises around Taiwan, the US has used terms such as \"intimidation tactics,\" \"provocative,\" \"coercive military activities,\" and \"aggressive military activities.\" In April 2025, the US Department of State accused China of \"putting regional security at risk\" with its drills. To date, US government statements have not officially characterized China's actions as a \"blockade.\" Historically, even during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the US did not formally accuse China of a blockade. Diplomatic talks between the US and China were held in Shanghai in April 2025.\n\nAccording to US military leaders, the upcoming 2025 National Defense Strategy (NDS) will prioritize \"preventing a Chinese attack on Taiwan\" as the sole major assumption scenario. This represents a strategic shift to focus on the Indo-Pacific region. At the same time, US Admiral Samuel Paparo has warned that China is rapidly increasing its production of warships and submarines relative to the US, stating a production ratio of 6 to 1.8 for warships and 2 to 1.4 for submarines. Paparo stated that while the US would prevail in a conflict now, its military forces are on a \"bad trajectory.\"",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 56 days until July 1, 2025, from today (May 6, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No - The US has not accused China of blockading Taiwan and continues to characterize Chinese military activities with terms like 'provocative' and 'coercive' rather than 'blockade'",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "China continues conducting military exercises that simulate blockades but does not actually prevent ships from entering or leaving Taiwan's seaports. The US maintains diplomatic language that stops short of officially accusing China of implementing an actual blockade, as it has done historically even during past Taiwan Strait crises.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "China escalates from simulated exercises to actually blockading one or more of Taiwan's seaports by preventing commercial or military vessels from entering or leaving without Taiwanese consent. This dramatic escalation forces the US government to publicly and officially characterize the action as a blockade.",
    "rationale": "The critical distinction is between military exercises that simulate blockades versus an actual blockade of Taiwan's seaports. Currently, China is conducting exercises that US officials acknowledge as rehearsals for blockade scenarios, but these are simulations, not actual blockades. The question requires the US to accuse China of 'blockading at least one of Taiwan's seaports' - meaning actual interdiction of maritime traffic, not exercises. The status quo strongly favors NO for several reasons: (1) Historically, even during the 1995-1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis, the US avoided formally declaring a Chinese blockade; (2) Diplomatic talks between the US and China continued as recently as April 2025, suggesting channels remain open; (3) An actual blockade would represent a massive escalation with enormous geopolitical consequences that neither side has shown signs of pursuing; (4) With only 8 weeks remaining, there's limited time for such a dramatic shift from the current pattern of exercises. The forecast is not lower because: genuine tensions exist, China explicitly practices blockade scenarios, US military leaders acknowledge China's growing capabilities and bad trajectory, and there's always tail risk of miscalculation or deliberate escalation in such a tense environment. The forecast is not higher because the status quo is powerful - the world changes slowly, actual blockades would trigger international crises, and there are no current indicators of imminent escalation beyond exercises. I would update higher if reports emerged of Chinese forces actually preventing ships from accessing Taiwan ports, or if diplomatic relations collapsed suddenly. I would update lower if tensions de-escalated or diplomatic progress was made.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
