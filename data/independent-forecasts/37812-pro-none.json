    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. As of late May 2025, there are 49 direct flight destinations listed on the resolution source, which is below the threshold of 51.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The ongoing low-level conflict on Lebanon's southern border persists or slightly worsens through June 2025. This continued instability suppresses tourism and business travel demand, causing airlines to scrap or postpone planned seasonal summer routes. The number of destinations remains at 49 or decreases, resulting in a 'No' outcome.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A de-escalation or a durable ceasefire is achieved between Israel and Hezbollah in late May or early June. This boosts confidence significantly, and several airlines react quickly by launching or reinstating seasonal summer flights to European holiday destinations to capture pent-up VFR (Visiting Friends and Relatives) and tourist demand. This late surge adds three or more net destinations, pushing the total above 51.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted towards the status quo. The resolution source currently lists 49 direct destinations from Beirut, meaning a net increase of at least three destinations is required in the next six weeks for a 'Yes' outcome. This is a high bar in a short timeframe, especially given the current environment. The primary factor influencing this forecast is the ongoing conflict on the southern border, which, as noted in the provided articles, has severely damaged Lebanon's tourism prospects. Major airlines are risk-averse and are more likely to cancel routes than add them under such conditions of instability. The country's severe economic crisis further dampens demand and airline confidence. While there may be some seasonal routes typically added for the summer, the security situation makes it more likely these will be curtailed or cancelled, offsetting any potential additions. The probability is not lower than 15% because a sudden, unexpected ceasefire could lead to a rapid reinstatement of previously planned summer routes by airlines eager to capitalize on any positive development. VFR traffic is also a resilient demand driver. The probability is not higher because a 'Yes' outcome requires not just a cessation of hostilities but also a swift and coordinated operational response from multiple airlines to add new services, which is a significant logistical challenge in under six weeks. I would raise my forecast if a stable, internationally-recognized ceasefire is announced and holds. I would lower it further if the conflict escalates to affect Beirut more directly or if a major carrier suspends its flights.",
