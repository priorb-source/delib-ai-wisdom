    "review": "The other forecasters and I are in broad agreement on the key drivers: the extremely short time frame and the general inertia of the DJIA Averages Committee are the strongest factors pointing towards a 'No' outcome. Forecaster 2 makes a compelling point that the very recent changes to the index (e.g., Intel's removal) actually decrease the likelihood of another change so soon, as the committee has already acted to refresh the components. Forecaster 3 provides an excellent, more detailed base-rate analysis, correctly noting that changes are infrequent and tend to cluster around specific catalysts, none of which appear imminent. I found Forecaster 3's argument about Boeing particularly convincing: the committee has historically tolerated prolonged periods of turbulence from the company without removing it, suggesting the bar for removal is very high and unlikely to be met in the next two months based on current events. This specific counterpoint tempers the view that Boeing is an immediate, high-risk candidate for removal.",
    "rationale": "I am lowering my forecast from 15% to 10%. My initial forecast may have slightly overweighted the recent negative stock performance of several members and the general risk associated with a large company like Boeing facing headwinds. The other forecasters' analyses, particularly Forecaster 3's, have persuaded me to put more weight on two factors. First, the committee's inertia is likely higher than I initially modeled, precisely because they have made significant changes recently (Walgreens/Amazon, Intel/Nvidia). This reduces the pressure to act again so quickly. Second, the historical precedent of the committee tolerating significant, prolonged issues at companies like Boeing suggests that the current problems are not yet at the threshold that would trigger a removal within this short window. My updated 10% forecast better reflects the dominance of the status quo while still accounting for the small but real risk of a sudden, unexpected catalyst like a major corporate action or a truly unprecedented crisis emerging before July 1.",
