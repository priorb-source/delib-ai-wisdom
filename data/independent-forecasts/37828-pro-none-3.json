    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 5 weeks, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. Rippling remains a private company and does not announce plans for an IPO.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an S-1 filing or a formal announcement on Rippling's website. This is the most likely scenario, as the company may prefer to wait for more favorable market conditions or continue its growth trajectory as a private entity.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Seeing a brief but favorable window in the public markets, Rippling's leadership, having already done the preparatory work confidentially, either files its Form S-1 with the SEC or makes a formal announcement on its company news blog before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily weighted by the extremely short time frame remaining until the July 1, 2025 deadline. As of today, May 22, 2025, there are only about five weeks left. The process for an Initial Public Offering is complex and lengthy, typically taking many months of preparation. While a company's success, as noted in the background information, is a prerequisite for an IPO, it does not guarantee one will happen in any specific, narrow timeframe. The status quo is that Rippling is a private company, and without strong signals to the contrary, this is the most likely state to persist over a short period. There are currently no public reports, rumors, or company statements indicating that an IPO announcement is imminent. An announcement within the next five weeks would be a significant surprise. \n\nMy probability is not lower than 2% because companies can and do work on IPO filings confidentially, and a surprise announcement is not impossible, especially if they aim to seize a sudden market opportunity. \n\nMy probability is not higher because the lack of any public signaling combined with the logistical hurdles of preparing for a public offering makes an announcement within this tight window highly improbable. \n\nI would increase my forecast significantly upon seeing credible media reports (e.g., from Bloomberg, Reuters) that Rippling has confidentially filed or has hired investment banks for an imminent IPO. I would decrease it if the company announced a new large private funding round, which would reduce the near-term need for public capital.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Rippling announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Startup News: Shares of HR firm Rippling gain value as its business expands](https://forgeglobal.com/insights/blog/startup-news-shares-of-rippling-gain-value-as-its-business-expands/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Rippling, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://www.rippling.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-22.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
