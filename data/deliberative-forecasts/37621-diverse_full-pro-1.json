    "review": "My initial forecast of 65% was a significant outlier compared to the other two forecasters (32% and 34%). After reviewing their analyses, I find their reasoning highly compelling. They placed much greater weight on two factors that I had underappreciated: 1) The structural difficulty of overcoming an 8-vote shortfall to reach the 24-vote supermajority in such a short time. My interpretation of the initial 16 votes was too optimistic. 2) Forecaster 3 raised an excellent point about the unintended consequences of the reworked, broader rule. Banning all forms of pushing/pulling a ball-carrier could lead to significant enforcement issues and officiating controversies, which could make swing-voting owners hesitant to support it. They correctly argue that the lack of injury data severely weakens the league's primary justification for the rule change, leaving aesthetics and competitive balance as the main arguments, which are far less persuasive.",
    "rationale": "The other forecasters' analyses have convinced me that my initial assessment was too high. I overweighted the political influence of the Commissioner's office and underestimated the power of the status quo, especially when changing it requires a 75% supermajority. The 8-vote gap is substantial, and the point that the proposed 'solution'—a broader ban on aiding the runner—could introduce widespread officiating ambiguity is a powerful argument for owners to vote 'No'. This reframing, which I initially saw as a clever tactic to gain support, may actually have the opposite effect by creating a new set of problems. The absence of specific safety data makes it much harder for the league office to pressure owners into voting for a change that has a direct impact on competitive outcomes. While the Commissioner's support makes a ban possible, it is not the most probable outcome. I am therefore substantially revising my forecast downward. My new forecast acknowledges the significant hurdles that the other analysts correctly identified, while still recognizing that the concerted push from league leadership gives the proposal a non-trivial chance of passing.",
