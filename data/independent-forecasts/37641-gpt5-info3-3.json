  "information": "According to multiple reports in May 2025, Circle's IPO plans were paused or delayed due to market volatility, sometimes referred to as the 'Trump effect'. A May 12 article in Expansión specifically listed Circle among several companies putting IPO plans on hold. However, the market for fintech listings is not entirely closed, as exemplified by the IPO of eToro on May 13. The broader cryptocurrency sector saw venture capital funding double to $6 billion in Q1 2025 compared to the previous year, despite a drop in the number of deals. During the same quarter, the total market value of stablecoins increased by 12%. The regulatory framework for stablecoins in the U.S. remains under development.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 47 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Circle is not currently listed, and recent reports say its IPO plans are paused; without a clear re-start, listing by end of June is unlikely.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Circle keeps its IPO on hold through June, or resumes too late to complete a roadshow and pricing window before July 1; SEC review or market volatility delays effectiveness; or Circle lists on Nasdaq (or after July 1) rather than the NYSE.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Circle quickly reopens its IPO process, clears SEC comments, launches a one-week roadshow in early-to-mid June, prices the deal, and begins trading on the NYSE before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: There are ~6–7 weeks left. A fast-track IPO can complete in 2–4 weeks after re-opening if SEC comments are largely cleared, but that requires a stable market window and rapid execution. Q2 IPO activity often tapers near the July 4 holiday, compressing the feasible window to mid/late June.\n- Status quo: Multiple May reports indicate Circle paused or delayed its IPO due to volatility (“Trump effect”). If nothing changes, this yields a No by July 1. I place extra weight on this status quo because most plans don’t abruptly reverse in a short time.\n- Exchange constraint: Resolution requires trading on the NYSE specifically. If Circle opts for Nasdaq, this resolves No even if it goes public. That lowers the odds relative to a generic “public by July 1” question.\n- Offsetting positives: The IPO market isn’t shut (eToro reportedly listed May 13). Crypto/fintech sentiment has pockets of strength: crypto VC funding rose in Q1 and stablecoin market cap grew ~12% in the quarter. If Circle’s SEC review is advanced and it’s fundamentally profitable in a higher-rate environment, a June listing remains plausible.\n- Why not higher: Recent pause reports, a narrow calendar, the NYSE-only criterion, and potential regulatory uncertainty on stablecoins. These factors make a near-term listing challenging.\n- Why not lower: Circle has been working toward an IPO for some time and could be far along with the SEC; if markets settle, they could move quickly. Evidence of another fintech IPO succeeding shows the window is not fully closed.\n- What would move me up: An amended S-1 with a preliminary price range; announcement of a roadshow; explicit confirmation of NYSE listing (ticker assignment); signs of calmer markets and strong contemporaneous IPO pricings.\n- What would move me down: Further credible reports of postponement into 2H 2025; signs of unresolved SEC issues; heightened market volatility; Circle signaling Nasdaq (or any exchange other than NYSE) or timing beyond July 1.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Circle be publicly-traded before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nForbes: [The Circle IPO Solidifies 2025 As The Year Of Stablecoins](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2025/04/04/the-circle-ipo-solidifies-2025-as-the-year-of-stablecoin/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
