  "information": "Libya's Economy and Trade Minister, Muhammed Huveyc, announced in May 2025 that the country aims to increase its trade volume with Turkey from $3.7 billion to $10 billion. To facilitate this, joint committees have been established to address issues such as the return of Turkish companies to projects in Libya and the resolution of bank guarantees. The two countries are also working towards eliminating taxes and establishing a free trade zone, with the stated goal of using Libya's strategic location to facilitate the transport of Turkish industrial products to the broader African market.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "2 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Libyan government's administrative and political focus remains on its major bilateral trade initiative with Turkey. The complex internal political situation and the lack of a strong domestic push for the pan-African agreement mean that the legislative process for ratification is not initiated or completed. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes with Libya not having deposited its instrument of ratification.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A powerful faction within a unified Libyan government, or an influential external partner, successfully pressures for the immediate ratification of AfCFTA as a symbolic foreign policy victory or to unlock specific benefits. The ratification process is fast-tracked through the relevant legislative body and the instrument of ratification is deposited with the African Union Commission just before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by the status quo and recent evidence of Libya's economic priorities. Libya has signed but not ratified the AfCFTA agreement, and significant inertia exists. The primary factor driving my low probability is the information from the research assistant's report. The announcement in May 2025 that Libya is focused on a deep bilateral trade agreement with Turkey, aiming to nearly triple trade volume to $10 billion, indicates that political and administrative resources are directed there. This initiative is a major undertaking, likely consuming the attention of the Ministry of Economy and Trade.\n\nThe timeline is extremely short. With only two months remaining until the deadline, completing a domestic ratification process for a major international treaty is a significant challenge even for a stable government. For Libya, with its historically fragmented political landscape, such a rapid legislative process is highly improbable.\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 5% because surprise political developments are always possible in Libya's fluid environment. Ratification could be used as a low-cost diplomatic signal or a bargaining chip, and could theoretically be pushed through quickly if a key leader decides it is a priority. However, there is currently no evidence to suggest this is the case.\n\nMy forecast is not higher than 5% because the evidence points squarely away from AfCFTA being a priority. The focus is on the Turkish deal, which serves a similar strategic goal of making Libya a trade hub, but through a bilateral, not multilateral, framework. The short deadline and internal political hurdles present formidable obstacles.\n\nI would increase my forecast if there were public statements from high-level Libyan officials prioritizing immediate AfCFTA ratification or if the required legislation were officially tabled in the House of Representatives. I would decrease my forecast if there were further announcements solidifying the Turkey trade deal as the government's sole external economic focus.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Libya ratify AfCFTA (the pan-African free trade agreement) before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [African Continental Free Trade Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Continental_Free_Trade_Area)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Libya ratifies the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Agreement before July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nLibya's Economy and Trade Minister, Muhammed Huveyc, announced in May 2025 that the country aims to increase its trade volume with Turkey from $3.7 billion to $10 billion.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
