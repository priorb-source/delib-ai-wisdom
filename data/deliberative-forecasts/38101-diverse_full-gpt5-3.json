    "review": "Both analyses are directionally aligned with my prior view (slight lean to No). New arguments I noted: (1) Forecaster 2’s explicit “reversion to the mean” lens for Ishiba after a scandal-driven trough, which adds mild upward drift risk for Ishiba’s approval; (2) Forecaster 3’s framing of the current 4-point late-May gap as the operative status quo with only a month left and a 7-day moving average dampening big late swings. Neither added hard new data beyond what I had, but both strengthened the case for modestly lower odds of a Starmer overtake given tie=No and June’s UK event risk. I find their reasoning generally convincing, particularly the combination of small margin, limited time, and MC smoothing. The main caveat is the uncertainty around the late-May MC figures; still, treating them as roughly accurate supports a slight downweighting of Yes.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: Late May indications (Starmer ~28%, Ishiba ~32%) imply Ishiba leading by ~4 points; ties resolve No. With ~1 month remaining and Morning Consult’s 7-day moving average, large reversals are possible but less likely. UK June calendar risk (June 11 spending review; civil service cuts headline) skews short-term sentiment risks against Starmer. Japan risk set is quieter; the voucher scandal appears to be past peak salience, making stabilization in low 30s plausible. Early May’s Starmer lead (36 vs 29) shows volatility, so a flip back remains plausible, but requires both Starmer improvement and/or Ishiba slippage within a damped averaging window. Net: Status quo favors No; volatility and potential UK positive surprises keep a non-trivial Yes path. I slightly trim my prior 41% to reflect the added weight on reversion for Ishiba and the constrained time window.",
