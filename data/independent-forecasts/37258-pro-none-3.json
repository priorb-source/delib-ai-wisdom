    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than two months. The question resolves on July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The Scottish government continues to advocate for independence but does not announce a referendum date due to the existing legal and political stalemate with the UK government.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Scottish National Party (SNP) leadership chooses to focus on the aftermath of the recent UK general election and building a sustained case for independence, rather than announcing a referendum date that would be legally challenged by the UK government and likely boycotted by unionist parties. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an official announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "In a strategic move to energize the independence movement and apply maximum political pressure on the UK government, the First Minister of Scotland unilaterally announces a specific date for a consultative independence referendum, explicitly stating that the Scottish government will proceed regardless of Westminster's approval. This announcement satisfies the question's criteria, even if the referendum's legality is immediately challenged.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is a low 5%. The primary barrier is the November 2022 UK Supreme Court ruling, which determined the Scottish Parliament cannot legislate for a referendum without the UK Parliament's consent. This consent has been consistently withheld by the Conservative government and the Labour opposition has also stated it will not grant it, creating a durable legal and political obstacle.\n\nThe only viable path to a 'Yes' outcome within the timeframe is a unilateral declaration by the Scottish government. However, this would be a high-risk strategy. Such a referendum would lack legal force, be boycotted by unionists, and its result would likely not be recognized internationally, potentially damaging the independence cause in the long run. The SNP's recent strategy has centered on using general elections as 'de facto' referendums, which moves focus away from holding a separate, unsanctioned vote.\n\nWith less than two months until the deadline, there are no political signals or preparatory work to suggest such a major announcement is imminent. The political focus is likely to be on the consequences of the UK general election (which must happen by January 2025) rather than on launching a new, contentious referendum initiative.\n\nWhy the probability is not zero: The Scottish government retains the political agency to make such an announcement. A significant and sustained surge in polling for independence, or intense internal pressure within the SNP, could precipitate a surprise declaration as a political tactic. The question's criteria deliberately ignore the issue of UK legality, making this low-probability scenario a valid path to a 'Yes' resolution.\n\nWhy the probability is not higher: The fundamental political and legal realities are overwhelmingly stacked against this outcome. A unilateral move would be a significant strategic gamble with a high chance of backfiring. The short timeframe and lack of any current momentum towards this scenario make it highly improbable.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Scotland officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe National: [Yes posts huge 11-point lead in new Scottish independence poll](https://www.thenational.scot/news/25089457.yes-posts-huge-11-point-lead-new-scottish-independence-poll/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Scotland from the United Kingdom is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Scotland. Please note that broader legality, such as within the United Kingdom, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-02.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
