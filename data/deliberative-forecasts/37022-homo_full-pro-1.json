    "review": "The other two forecasters reached nearly identical conclusions to my own, which strengthens my confidence in the initial analysis. All three of us identified the same primary drivers for the debt increase in March 2025: the IMF tranche, domestic bond issuance, and the effect of hryvnia depreciation. We all calculated a baseline increase of approximately 52 billion UAH, which is substantially more than the 31 billion UAH needed to cross the threshold.\n\nThe only point of divergence is the precise level of uncertainty. Forecaster 2 aligns perfectly with my 95% forecast, citing similar minor uncertainties. Forecaster 3 arrived at a slightly more conservative 90%, placing more weight on the potential for accounting lags (e.g., inflows being booked in April) and higher-than-expected debt servicing costs. While Forecaster 3's caution is reasonable, their arguments do not introduce new evidence I hadn't considered, but rather assign a different weight to the known uncertainties.",
    "rationale": "I am maintaining my forecast of 95%. The deliberation process has reinforced my initial reasoning rather than casting doubt on it. The arguments for a 'Yes' outcome are robust and based on multiple, independent factors.\n\nWhile I acknowledge Forecaster 3's point about uncertainty from accounting lags and repayments, I believe the probability of these factors preventing the resolution is lower than 10%. For the outcome to be 'No', there would need to be a substantial negative shock. For example, even if we assume the entire $400 million IMF tranche (~16 billion UAH) was not officially recorded in March, the sum of the other two factors—domestic bonds (~26 billion UAH) and currency depreciation (~10 billion UAH)—would still sum to approximately 36 billion UAH. This amount, on its own, is sufficient to cross the 31 billion UAH threshold. \n\nTherefore, a 'No' outcome would require the confluence of multiple negative events: a delay in booking the IMF funds *and* significant, unannounced debt repayments or a major failure in domestic bond auctions. The likelihood of this compound failure is very low, and I believe my 5% uncertainty adequately captures this tail risk. The analyses of the other forecasters have confirmed the core components of my forecast, giving me no reason to adjust it.",
