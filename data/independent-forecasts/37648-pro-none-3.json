    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 6 weeks, until July 1, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No formal nuclear deal exists between the United States and Iran. Informal de-escalation talks continue, but Iran's nuclear program progresses without the constraints of a formal agreement.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Indirect talks continue without a breakthrough. Domestic political opposition in both Washington and Tehran, coupled with the short timeline, prevents the finalization of a formal agreement. The parties may maintain some informal understandings, but nothing is publicly announced by the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Motivated by a mutual desire to avoid military conflict and, for Iran, to gain economic relief, US and Iranian negotiators, likely through Omani or Qatari intermediaries, finalize a limited, 'less-for-less' agreement. This deal might involve Iran freezing its 60% uranium enrichment in exchange for the US unfreezing specific Iranian assets. A joint announcement is made before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "The status quo baseline strongly favors a 'No' outcome. For years, deep-seated mistrust and formidable domestic political opposition in both the US and Iran have prevented the revival of the JCPOA or the creation of a new deal. Such agreements are complex and typically require a much longer negotiation period than the roughly six weeks remaining until the deadline. However, the intelligence noted in my briefing from Israeli media is a significant piece of evidence pointing towards a 'Yes' outcome. The report that senior Israeli ministers were informed of a 'high chance' of a deal suggests that back-channel negotiations are far more advanced than publicly known. Israeli intelligence on this matter is generally credible, and a formal briefing at this level indicates the information is being taken seriously. This singular, strong signal must be weighed against the powerful structural barriers. My forecast of 35% attempts to balance these competing factors. It reflects a significant update from a low baseline, driven entirely by the provided intelligence report, but remains below 50% to account for the very real possibility that the deal falls apart due to the short timeline or political headwinds. My forecast is not higher because the timeline is extremely tight, and successful diplomacy is not guaranteed even with political will. Furthermore, this is a second-hand report from a third party, not a direct confirmation from the primary actors. My forecast is not lower because dismissing a specific, high-level intelligence report of this nature would be imprudent; it indicates a substantial shift in the probability of a deal. I would increase my forecast upon official confirmation of progress from US or Iranian officials. I would decrease it following strong public denials or a significant regional escalation.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the United States and Iran announce a new nuclear deal before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nIsraeli media (Hebrew): [Senior ministers were informed: There is a high chance that the US and Iran will reach an agreement](https://www.kan.org.il/content/kan-news/politic/895178/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the US and Iran sign or announce an agreement with respect to Iran's nuclear program.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-15.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
