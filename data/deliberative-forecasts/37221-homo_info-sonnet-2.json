    "review": "The other forecasters raise several compelling points I had underweighted. Forecaster 2's ECB policy context is particularly strong - seven rate cuts with the deposit rate at 2.25% and officials signaling room for more cuts would be incompatible with inflation persistently above 2.2%. This is powerful institutional evidence. Forecaster 3's timing insight is important: it's April 28, so all April price data has been collected; we're just waiting for compilation and release. This doesn't change the expected direction but does clarify that the outcome is already determined. The PMI data (ten consecutive months near/below 50) and decelerating wage growth are additional concrete indicators I hadn't explicitly considered. These directly address the services inflation concern I had raised, as wage deceleration should help moderate the +1.56pp services contribution. Both forecasters are slightly lower than my initial 28% (at 22% and 25%), and their arguments for sustained disinflationary pressure are well-supported.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, the evidence for a No outcome is stronger than I initially weighted. The combination of: (1) March inflation at exactly 2.2% with downward trend from 2.3%, (2) economist consensus at 2.1%, (3) aggressive ECB easing cycle indicating confidence in disinflation, (4) sustained economic weakness via PMI data, (5) decelerating wage growth moderating services inflation, and (6) the strict threshold requirement (ABOVE 2.2%, not at or equal to) all point toward a probability below my initial 28%. However, I maintain some probability for a Yes outcome because: month-to-month inflation data can be volatile, consensus forecasts carry uncertainty with typical standard errors of 0.2-0.4pp, and we lack preliminary April data. Services inflation at +1.56pp remains a potential upside risk. The range of 22-28% across all forecasters seems appropriate given the strong disinflationary evidence balanced against inherent forecast uncertainty. I'm updating downward to 24%, aligning more closely with the other forecasters while maintaining a modest probability for upside surprise.",
