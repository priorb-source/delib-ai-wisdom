  "information": "The White House has officially confirmed that President Donald Trump will attend the G7 summit in Canada from June 15-17, 2025. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that details of the visit would be announced shortly. Numerous media outlets reported the confirmation in late May 2025, and official G7 participant lists dated June 3 include Trump.\n\nThe 51st G7 Summit is scheduled to take place in Kananaskis, Alberta. Security measures are being implemented, including a controlled access zone around summit venues from June 10-18 and temporary airspace restrictions. In advance of the leaders' summit, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell attended preparatory G7 meetings in Banff. Historically, sitting U.S. presidents have attended every in-person G7/G8 summit since its inception in 1975.\n\nAccording to reports from the Nikkei newspaper, the upcoming G7 summit may not produce a traditional final joint statement due to disagreements between the U.S. and other member nations. The summit may instead result in several separate documents on specific topics of cooperation, while excluding more contentious issues like global trade and relations with Russia from the formal agenda to avoid conflict. In preparation for the summit, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is scheduled to meet with President Trump at the White House on June 5.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12-14 days, as the summit runs from June 15-17, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The White House has confirmed President Trump's attendance, his name is on official participant lists, and historical precedent shows US presidents consistently attend the G7.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, acute health crisis concerning President Trump, or a severe, unforeseen national security emergency (such as a major terrorist attack or natural disaster) requires his physical presence in the White House, forcing a last-minute cancellation of his trip.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "President Trump follows the official, publicly confirmed schedule, travels to Kananaskis, Alberta, and physically participates in the G7 summit meetings with other heads of state between June 15 and 17, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The forecast is based on strong positive evidence. The White House has officially confirmed President Trump's attendance for the June 15-17 summit, a fact corroborated by multiple media outlets and his inclusion on official participant lists as of June 3. This establishes a clear and strong status quo. Further supporting this, high-level U.S. officials are already attending preparatory meetings, and diplomatic engagements, like Chancellor Scholz's upcoming visit to Washington, are proceeding as planned. Historically, U.S. presidents have attended every G7/G8 summit since 1975, creating a powerful base rate in favor of attendance. The reported disagreements on a final joint communiqué do not suggest a cancellation; rather, the plan to issue separate documents indicates a workaround to ensure the summit proceeds. The probability is not higher than 98% to account for low-probability but high-impact events, such as a sudden health emergency or a major domestic/international crisis that would necessitate his presence in the U.S. The probability is not lower because there is currently no evidence suggesting any such event is likely, and a cancellation at this late stage would be a significant diplomatic disruption requiring an extraordinary cause. I would lower my forecast upon credible reports of a specific health, security, or diplomatic crisis. I would raise it slightly once Air Force One is confirmed to be en route to Canada.",
