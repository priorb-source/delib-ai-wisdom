  "information": "Anthropic's historical release cadence for major versions shows a lengthening gap: approximately 5 months between Claude 1 (March 2023) and Claude 2 (July 2023), and approximately 8 months between Claude 2 and Claude 3 (March 2024). Previous numbered Claude models have been made available to paid web users and via API within 48 hours of their announcement, without a public waitlist.\n\nAccording to reports from Cursor-IDE (May 15) and ZDNet (May 16), a next-generation Anthropic model codenamed 'Claude Neptune' completed its red-team testing phase on May 18. The same reports indicate a target for general availability in late May or early June. In the past, Anthropic has used internal codenames that later became part of public branding, such as the codename 'Asimov' for the models released as the Claude 3 family.\n\nA February 2025 report from Sina Finance described plans for Claude 4 to be a hybrid model combining a general-purpose model with a reasoning model, which would allow users to adjust the computational resources used for a given task. Other mentions in tech-focused publications, such as a March 2025 post on DEV Community and information on the PromptLayer blog, have framed the release of Claude 4 as expected 'later in 2025'.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months (46 days from May 16, 2025 to July 1, 2025).",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No. The current latest model is the Claude 3 family. If Anthropic does not release a new model named Claude 4 before the deadline, the outcome will be No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Anthropic encounters unexpected technical issues or security vulnerabilities after the red-teaming phase of its next model, delaying the public release until after July 1, 2025. Alternatively, the new model released in this timeframe is an incremental update named 'Claude 3.5' rather than the major version 'Claude 4', pushing the latter's release to later in the year.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The recent media reports are accurate. The model codenamed 'Claude Neptune' completes its final testing, is officially named 'Claude 4', and is released to the public via API and the web in late May or early June 2025, well before the July 1 deadline.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is heavily influenced by recent, specific reports from May 2025 indicating that Anthropic's next-generation model, codenamed 'Claude Neptune', has completed red-teaming and is targeted for a general availability release in late May or early June. This timeline provides a comfortable buffer before the July 1 deadline. Anthropic's history of making new models publicly accessible shortly after announcement, without a waitlist, aligns with the resolution criteria. The main driver for this high probability is the timeliness and specificity of these reports, which typically signal a launch is imminent. \n\nMy forecast is not higher because software releases are prone to last-minute delays. An unforeseen critical bug or a strategic decision could postpone the launch. Furthermore, there is a non-trivial risk that this new model may not be named 'Claude 4'. Anthropic could opt for an intermediate branding like 'Claude 3.5', which would resolve this question as No. The older reports mentioning a release 'later in 2025' also add a small degree of uncertainty, although they are likely outdated.\n\nMy forecast is not lower because the volume and specificity of the 'Claude Neptune' leaks represent strong evidence against the status quo. In the highly competitive AI landscape, there is immense pressure on Anthropic to release its next-generation model to keep pace with competitors. The completion of red-teaming is a major milestone that makes a release within the next 1-2 months highly plausible.\n\nI would increase my forecast if Anthropic officially announces a launch event for June or if more leaks confirm the 'Claude 4' branding for the upcoming model. I would decrease my forecast if credible reports of a delay emerge, if a competitor's major release changes the strategic landscape, or if an official announcement reveals the new model will not be named 'Claude 4'.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Claude 4 be available to the general public before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nPromptLayer: [Everything we know: Claude 4](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-4/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if a member of the general public can access Anthropic's Claude 4 model without first joining a waitlist or participating in an early access or testing phase. If Anthropic does not release Claude 4 before July 1, 2025, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nThe resolution will rely on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions), including that it may rely on the ability of Metaculus employees to access Claude 4. \"Access\" may be via API, the Anthropic website, or any other method that allows interaction with Claude 4. Models that do not include both \"Claude\" and \"4\" in the name will not be considered for resolution of this question.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAnthropic's historical release cadence for major versions shows a lengthening gap: approximately 5 months between Claude 1 (March 2023) and Claude 2 (July 2023), and approximately 8 months between Claude 2 and Claude 3 (March 2024).
