  "information": "South Sudan signed the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) agreement in 2019 but, as of early May 2025, is one of the few states that have not deposited their instruments of ratification with the African Union. The ratification process requires a bill to pass the Transitional National Legislative Assembly, be signed by the President, and have the formal instrument lodged with the AU Commission. Historically, South Sudan's legislative processes can be lengthy; for example, the country took six years to ratify the Maputo Protocol.\n\nThe government of South Sudan is currently focused on several pressing domestic issues, including a delayed peace roadmap and preparations for national elections scheduled for December 2025. The country is also facing a fiscal crisis following a collapse in oil revenue due to a shutdown of a Red Sea pipeline. Further complicating the political landscape, the Vice-President and other senior officials were arrested in late April 2025. The national legislature has been meeting infrequently, sitting for only 32 days in the second half of 2024, and its published calendar for May-June 2025 includes no trade-related bills. Additionally, the Finance Ministry has not budgeted for the obligations associated with AfCFTA ratification, such as tariff reductions.\n\nOn the continental level, the AfCFTA has achieved 92% consensus on trade rules, with 49 of 54 African countries having joined the agreement. To support implementation, initiatives such as the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) have been introduced. Within South Sudan, both the Chamber of Commerce and the Ministry of Trade have publicly advocated for ratification, with the Trade Minister reaffirming the government's commitment at an April 2025 summit. In February 2025, the East African Community (EAC) launched a new trade committee in South Sudan to help harmonize standards with the AfCFTA framework.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 60 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The TNLA does not table or pass an AfCFTA ratification bill in May–June, or passage occurs but the instrument of ratification is not deposited with the AU Commission before July 1, 2025.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The executive prioritizes AfCFTA, fast-tracks a ratification bill through the TNLA in late May or June, the President signs immediately, and the instrument is deposited with the AU Commission before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: South Sudan signed AfCFTA in 2019 but has not ratified. Ratification requires TNLA approval, presidential assent, and formal deposit with the AU Commission. Legislative processes in South Sudan are often slow (e.g., Maputo Protocol took six years). The research assistant notes the TNLA met infrequently in 2H 2024, its May–June 2025 calendar shows no trade bills, and the Finance Ministry hasn’t budgeted for AfCFTA-related obligations. The government is preoccupied with a fragile peace roadmap, a December 2025 election timeline, and a severe fiscal shock from disrupted oil exports. These factors support the status quo outcome of no ratification by July 1.\nCountervailing signals: Domestic stakeholders (Chamber of Commerce, Trade Ministry) are publicly urging ratification; the Trade Minister reiterated commitment at an April 2025 summit; and the EAC launched a trade committee in February 2025 to help harmonize standards. Politically, the government might value a quick, symbolic win. If prioritized, South Sudan can move legislation quickly and deposit instruments promptly.\nWeighing these: With only ~60 days left, the lack of the bill on the legislative calendar, competing crises, and the extra procedural step of depositing the instrument make a rapid sequence less likely. Still, a non-trivial chance remains if the presidency directs a fast-track and coordinates immediate deposit.\nWhy not higher: No visible bill, limited sitting days, fiscal/political distractions, and administrative lag to deposit with the AU. Why not lower: Clear public advocacy, regional pressure, and the possibility of an expedited process for a low-cost (symbolic) commitment.\nWhat would raise my forecast: Official TNLA agenda listing AfCFTA ratification; first/second readings or committee reports; cabinet approval communicating urgency; presidential statements ordering fast-track; MOFA or AU Commission notices about imminent deposit. What would lower it: Continued absence from the TNLA agenda by early June; reports of further legislative disruptions; confirmation that deposit logistics cannot be completed before July 1.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
