    "review": "Forecaster 2's analysis closely mirrors mine, emphasizing the compressed 20-day timeline, procedural barriers, and lack of evidence for imminent action. Their 2% is marginally lower but based on essentially identical reasoning. Forecaster 3 raises an important consideration I hadn't fully weighted: the potential existence of a late-May spring owners meeting. They reference this as an 'imminent May meeting' that could provide a procedural path for passage. This is a legitimate point - the NFL does occasionally hold spring meetings in May, and if one is scheduled before June 1, that would meaningfully increase the probability. However, Forecaster 3's 22% seems to assume greater certainty about this meeting's existence, agenda, and likelihood of passage than our evidence supports. Neither my research nor Forecaster 2's analysis confirms a scheduled May meeting. The CBS Sports article mentioned 'next owners meeting' with potential strong support, but didn't specify timing. Without confirmation that (a) a meeting is scheduled before June 1, (b) the Tush Push is on the agenda, and (c) there's momentum toward the 24-vote threshold, the probability remains low.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating slightly upward to account for the possibility of a May owners meeting that I hadn't explicitly incorporated. The NFL's meeting calendar does include spring sessions, and with ~20 days remaining, such a meeting is temporally feasible. However, several factors keep my forecast relatively low: (1) No confirmed information about a May meeting being scheduled or the Tush Push being on its agenda; (2) The March 2025 Annual Meeting (the primary rule-change venue) has passed without action; (3) Previous tabling suggests insufficient consensus for the 24-vote supermajority; (4) No reports of Competition Committee recommendations or owner vote counts; (5) My research assistant provided no updates suggesting imminent action. Forecaster 3's higher forecast appears based on assuming a May meeting will occur and the item will be seriously considered, but this represents optimism beyond available evidence. I'm splitting the difference between my original 5% and maintaining appropriate skepticism about unconfirmed procedural steps.",
