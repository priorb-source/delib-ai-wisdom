    "review": "The other two forecasters arrived at the identical conclusion (95%) based on the same core evidence and reasoning that I used. We all correctly identified the early May 2025 news reports of Berkshire increasing its stake to 7% as the single most important piece of information. Their analyses confirmed my view that this specific evidence, combined with the established accumulation pattern from the prior two quarters, heavily outweighs the more general counter-evidence of Berkshire being a net seller overall. We also all independently identified the same primary sources of uncertainty—the small possibility that the news reports were inaccurate or that the purchases occurred after the Q1 2025 reporting deadline—and assigned this uncertainty a similar weight. No new arguments or evidence were presented that I had not already considered.",
    "rationale": "My reasoning remains unchanged after reviewing the analyses of my peers. The strong consensus reinforces my initial forecast. The primary driver for the high probability of a 'Yes' outcome is the collection of news reports from early May 2025—immediately following Berkshire's annual meeting—stating that the company had increased its stake in Domino's to 7%. A 7% stake is significantly above the 2,382,000 share threshold. This specific, timely information is strongly supported by Berkshire's established pattern of buying Domino's shares in Q3 and Q4 of 2024. While the other forecasters and I agree that there is a small risk that these reports are incorrect or that the purchases took place after the March 31st cutoff, this risk is minor. The convergence of all three independent analyses on the same key evidence and the same forecast of 95% gives me high confidence in my original assessment. Therefore, I will not be updating my forecast.",
