    "review": "The other forecasters raise important points. Forecaster 3's emphasis on the high-rate environment suppressing demand is particularly relevant - this creates conditions where new completions could continue outpacing sales even during the traditional spring buying season. Both forecasters correctly note the seasonal dynamics, though they interpret them differently: Forecaster 2 sees spring patterns supporting 'some' growth, while Forecaster 3 notes spring 'typically favors absorption.' The latter is historically accurate, but in a high-rate environment, the typical seasonal pattern may be muted. All three of us converge on similar logic: strong long-term momentum versus the challenge of 10% growth in 3 months from extreme highs. The range of 28-38% reflects reasonable disagreement about how much weight to place on momentum versus mean reversion. Forecaster 3's slightly higher probability seems justified by the demand suppression argument, though I find 38% somewhat optimistic given the magnitude of required growth.",
    "rationale": "Upon reflection, I should weight the demand suppression factor more heavily. The high-rate environment is a structural headwind to home sales that could persist through May, allowing inventory to accumulate even during the spring season. The pipeline of homes under construction will complete regardless of market conditions, and if demand remains weak, these completions flow directly into inventory. However, I'm not moving as high as 38% because: (1) We're starting from an extreme base where even modest market adjustments could prevent further accumulation; (2) 17k units/month for 3 consecutive months is still aggressive; (3) Some seasonal absorption is likely even in weak demand; (4) Builders may moderate activity given elevated inventory. The key uncertainty is March/April momentum, which we cannot observe. Balancing the demand suppression argument against the challenges of rapid growth from extreme highs, I'm updating modestly upward but remaining more conservative than Forecaster 3.",
