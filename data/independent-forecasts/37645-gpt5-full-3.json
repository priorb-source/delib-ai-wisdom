  "information": "Student-led protests demanding the immediate dissolution of parliament and early elections have been ongoing in Serbia for over six months, originating from a tragic canopy collapse in Novi Sad in November 2024. Protestors threatened to escalate their actions if their demands were not met by mid-May. A survey conducted by the CRTA research center indicated that 59% of Serbian citizens support the students' actions. However, reports also suggest that the momentum of the protests has been waning and the political opposition remains fragmented.\n\nIn response to protests, government officials have maintained that there is no need for early elections. Vice-Premier Ivica Dačić stated that the ruling coalition has a 'stable majority' in parliament. Following the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, President Aleksandar Vučić announced that a decision would be made within ten days on whether to form a new government or hold elections. More recently, a May 14, 2025 article quoted Vučić saying the party would again decide 'within ten days' whether to form another new cabinet or go to the polls.\n\nFollowing the Prime Minister's resignation in January 2025, a constitutional deadline was triggered, requiring the formation of a new government to avoid a mandatory snap election. According to multiple wire-service reports from March and April 2025, a new government successfully won a confidence vote in the Serbian parliament in mid-April. This event removed the automatic, constitutionally-mandated trigger for snap elections before the summer.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 46 days (from May 15, 2025 until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The newly installed government continues governing through June, protests lose momentum, and the ruling coalition reiterates that there is no need for early elections. No official election date is set or announced before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Under pressure from renewed protests, internal coalition calculations, or a strategic move by President Vučić, parliament is dissolved and the presidency or relevant authority issues an official announcement setting a date for a snap general election, with the announcement made before July 1 (the election itself likely scheduled for later in 2025).",
    "rationale": "- What we know (per the research assistant): Student-led protests have persisted for months but appear to be waning; the opposition is fragmented. Government figures say there is no need for early elections and claim a stable majority. The PM resigned in January, which initially created a deadline for forming a government, but a new government won a confidence vote in mid-April, removing the automatic snap-election trigger. On May 14, President Vučić again said a decision would come within ten days on forming another cabinet or going to the polls.\n- Status quo reasoning: With a fresh confidence vote in mid-April and officials signaling stability, the default is no snap elections being announced imminently. The constitutional pressure has been lifted, and there is no regular election due this soon after the December 2023 vote, so inertia favors no announcement.\n- Why not higher: Although Vučić has a history of calling early elections, doing so right after forming a new government would be unusual. The protests’ momentum appears to be ebbing, and the opposition’s fragmentation reduces pressure for an immediate electoral reset. If elections were intended for autumn, the announcement could easily slip until after July 1, given typical political timings.\n- Why not lower: Serbia has had frequent snap elections over the past decade, and Vučić’s public hint on May 14 of a decision within ten days introduces some short-term announcement risk. A sudden escalation of protests, coalition fissures, or a strategic calculation (e.g., locking in perceived advantage or resetting legitimacy) could prompt a quick dissolution and announcement before July 1.\n- What would move me up: Credible reports of coalition strain; senior SNS figures signaling readiness to dissolve parliament; concrete procedural steps toward dissolution; major protest escalation or strikes; external pressure or a triggering political shock.\n- What would move me down: Clear, authoritative statements that no elections will be held in 2025; a detailed government legislative/program calendar through summer; visible consolidation of the new cabinet; protest turnout continuing to drop and no new catalysts.\nWeighing the fresh government mandate, stable majority claims, waning protests, and Vučić’s ambiguous signaling, I put a modest probability on a pre–July 1 announcement, but still favor No.",
