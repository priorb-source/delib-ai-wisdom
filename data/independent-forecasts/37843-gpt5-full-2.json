  "information": "According to reports from sources including The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Ars Technica in March 2025, Discord is planning an initial public offering (IPO) for 2025. The company is reportedly in discussions with investment banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase to prepare for a potential listing. While some sources describe the talks as exploratory, others mention the hiring of a new CEO with IPO experience as a signal of late-stage readiness. Discord's valuation was estimated at approximately $15 billion in 2021, and it has over 200 million monthly active users.\n\nDiscord had previously considered going public in 2021 but postponed those plans due to market volatility. That same year, Microsoft offered to acquire Discord for $10 billion, but the company's leadership rejected the offer and a potential IPO was considered as an alternative. Responding to the recent 2025 IPO reports, a Discord spokesperson stated that the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. Discord's revenue is generated through a 'freemium' model, selling subscriptions for premium features.\n\nThe environment for technology IPOs in 2025 is described with mixed signals. Some reports mention a favorable IPO window, noting that other tech firms like CoreWeave, Klarna, and Figma have recently filed to go public. Other reports highlight market volatility, pointing to a recent 7-8.7% drop in the tech-heavy Nasdaq index and uncertainty surrounding Fed rate and trade policies as potential headwinds for companies considering a public launch.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 38 days (deadline: 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Discord continues IPO preparations but opts to wait for a post–July 4 or fall window. It keeps any SEC submissions confidential and does not publish a specific IPO-plans post on its news/blog. No public S-1 appears on EDGAR before July 1.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Discord either (a) publicly files an S-1 in mid-to-late June to keep a summer/fall option open, or (b) posts on discord.com/blog that it has confidentially submitted a draft S-1 or otherwise specifically states it is planning an IPO in 2025.",
    "rationale": "I put extra weight on the status quo: as of May 23, there’s been no public filing or official company news, and only ~5.5 weeks remain. Large consumer-tech IPOs often avoid the July 4 holiday and may target a September window, reducing the incentive to publicly file by June 30 unless they want optionality or signaling. The research assistant’s summary raises the odds above a low base: multiple reputable March 2025 reports say Discord is planning a 2025 IPO, has engaged Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan, and installed a CEO with IPO experience. That indicates readiness. However, Discord’s comment of not addressing rumors, mixed market conditions, and the recent Nasdaq volatility all argue for caution and possible timing slippage. Also, the resolution requires either a public S-1 or a specific company news post; many firms keep drafts confidential and do not blog until the public filing, which caps near-term odds. Why not higher: short timeline to July 1, seasonality around early July, and typical practice of publicly filing closer to the actual roadshow (likely later in 2025). Why not lower: credible banking mandates and 2025 intent, plus a plausible path where Discord announces a confidential submission on its blog (which would satisfy the question) or publicly files to preserve a summer/fall option. Updaters: I would raise the probability on reports of a confidential submission from top-tier outlets, any company blog/press activity, or a strengthening IPO tape (peers filing/pricing successfully). I would lower it on renewed market drawdowns, peers pulling deals, or credible reporting that Discord is targeting a fall/late-2025 timeline without near-term filings.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will Discord announce that it is planning an IPO?\n\nQuestion background:\nArs Technica: [Discord is planning an IPO this year, and big changes could be on the horizon](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/report-discord-partners-with-jp-morgan-chase-goldman-sachs-for-a-2025-ipo/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if Discord, Inc., announces before July 1, 2025, that it is planning an initial public offering. In order to streamline the resolution of this question, there are two resolution sources for the IPO announcement: 1) The company filing an [SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp) or 2) An announcement at the [news](https://discord.com/blog) section of its website. If there is no such announcement before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nPlease note that for an announcement on the news section of the company's website to resolve the question as Yes, the announcement must be specific. Vague statements such as \"someday becoming a public company\" will not count. If there is any doubt, then greater weight will be placed on whether an S-1 has been filed.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAccording to reports from sources including The New York Times, Bloomberg, and Ars Technica in March 2025, Discord is planning an initial public offering (IPO) for 2025.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
