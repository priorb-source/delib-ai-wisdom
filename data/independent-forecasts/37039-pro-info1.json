  "information": "On April 2-3, 2025, the U.S. President announced comprehensive tariffs. The policy included a 10% base tariff on goods from almost all countries, effective April 5, and additional country-specific tariffs to take effect on April 9. For Switzerland, the total tariff was set at 31%. The stated justifications included that Switzerland had been 'taking advantage' of the US and as a response to alleged 61% tariffs imposed by Switzerland on American products.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 5 weeks, as of April 24, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. The tariff was announced and implemented in early April 2025, so the current Harmonized Tariff Schedule should reflect the 31% rate for Switzerland.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following successful diplomatic negotiations or significant pressure from negatively impacted US domestic industries (such as pharmaceuticals or watch importers), the White House announces a reversal or reduction of the Switzerland-specific tariff before the resolution date.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The administration's policy remains unchanged despite diplomatic protests from Switzerland and lobbying from some US businesses. The tariff, having already been implemented, remains in effect through June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "The basis for my forecast is the strong influence of the status quo. According to the provided information, the US administration announced and implemented a 31% tariff on Swiss goods effective April 9, 2025. Governmental policies, particularly recently enacted ones, possess significant inertia. The timeframe for resolution is very short—only about five weeks from today. This brief period is generally insufficient for the complex diplomatic and domestic processes required to reverse such a major trade policy to unfold and take effect.\n\nThe stated justifications for the tariff suggest a firm policy stance that is unlikely to be abandoned without a significant reason, such as a major concession from Switzerland that could be framed as a political 'win' for the administration. While diplomatic and domestic pressure to reverse the tariff is expected, its ability to force a change within this short window is limited.\n\nMy forecast is not higher because there is a non-zero probability of a rapid policy shift. The administration could use the tariff as a bargaining chip and quickly strike a deal, or unforeseen domestic economic disruptions could accelerate a reversal. My forecast is not lower because the default path for any new government regulation is to remain in place in the short term. Overturning a policy so soon after its implementation would require overcoming significant bureaucratic and political momentum.\n\nI would increase my probability if the administration publicly reaffirms its commitment to the tariff. I would decrease my probability if high-level talks between US and Swiss officials are announced or if influential industry groups launch a major, coordinated public campaign against the tariff.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the US government's harmonized tariff schedule list the tariff on Switzerland as 31% on June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nNew York Times: [Swiss Indignant to Make the Top 10 of Trump’s Tariffs List](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/04/business/trump-tariffs-switzerland.html)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the duty provided in the applicable subheading is + 31% for Switzerland at the American government's [harmonized tariff schedule](https://hts.usitc.gov/search?query=switzerland) when accessed by Metaculus on or after June 1, 2025.\n\nWhether the provision is listed as suspended will not affect resolution.\r\n\r\nPlease note that this question is asking whether the cell in the 'RATES OF DUTY' column '1, General' appearing alongside subheading 9903.01.60 on the Harmonized Tariff Schedule indicates an additional ad valorem duty rate of 31% for articles the product of Switzerland, regardless of any specificities noted in the 'Article Description' column.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nOn April 2-3, 2025, the U.S. President announced comprehensive tariffs.

The stated justifications included that Switzerland had been 'taking advantage' of the US and as a response to alleged 61% tariffs imposed by Switzerland on American products.\n\nToday is 2025-04-24.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
