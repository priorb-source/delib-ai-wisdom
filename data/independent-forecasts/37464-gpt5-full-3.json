  "information": "LPK1, a Renton, Washington establishment, is recalling approximately 303 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken Caesar wrap products. The recall was initiated due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, as the Caesar dressing packet contains fish (anchovies) which is not declared on the product label. The recall is designated as Class II. The affected products were produced on February 15, 17, and 19, 2025. The corresponding 'best by' dates were February 21, 23, and 25, 2025, and the lot codes were LPK1WA046, LPK1WA048, and LPK1WA050.\n\nThe recalled chicken Caesar wraps were distributed to vending machines located in office buildings within the state of Washington. The labeling issue was discovered by the company during a routine quality assurance check of ingredient labels. As of early May 2025, there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions or illnesses due to the consumption of these products. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has urged consumers and offices not to consume or serve the products and to either return them or dispose of them.\n\nThe recall was issued on February 24, 2025. According to the FSIS recall webpage, the status of the recall remained 'Active' as of May 8, 2025. The general FSIS process for closing a recall requires verification that all affected product has been accounted for and removed from commerce, and confirmation that the company has implemented appropriate corrective actions to prevent a recurrence.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 23 days (until May 31, 2025; the question resolves based on status before June 1)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (the recall is Active as of May 8, 2025; if it remains Active through May 31, it resolves No)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "FSIS keeps the recall status at Active through the end of May due to pending effectiveness checks, documentation lag, or a minor expansion/administrative delay, and only closes it in June or later.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "FSIS verifies product accountability and corrective actions for this small, limited-distribution recall and updates the status to Closed sometime in mid-to-late May.",
    "rationale": "Key facts: The recall (issued Feb 24, 2025) involves ~303 lbs of RTE chicken Caesar wraps sold via vending machines in Washington. It’s a Class II misbranding/undeclared fish allergen issue. Production dates were Feb 15/17/19 with best-by dates Feb 21/23/25—so the product’s shelf life ended over two months ago. No illnesses reported. FSIS page still shows Active as of May 8.\n\nBase-rate/Process view: FSIS typically closes small, limited-distribution recalls after they verify product removal and corrective actions. For small Class II, limited and short-shelf-life events like this, closure often occurs within a few weeks to a few months. We are already ~10 weeks post-announcement. That makes eventual closure very likely, but the key is timing before June 1.\n\nStatus quo weight: As of May 8 it remains Active, so the status quo favors No. However, given the very small quantity, single-state, vending-machine distribution, and the products’ February best-by dates, practical cleanup should be straightforward. That supports a meaningful chance of closure within the next 2–3 weeks.\n\nWhy not higher? It has already remained Active longer than many similar small recalls, suggesting either slow paperwork/verification or minor complications. FSIS site updates can lag. Any added verification steps or administrative backlog could push closure into June.\n\nWhy not lower? There’s no sign of illnesses, expansions, or ongoing distribution. All product should be out of commerce, and this is a limited scope recall. Those factors point toward an imminent close-out once FSIS completes effectiveness checks.\n\nWhat would move me up: FSIS posting other small recalls closing in May (indicating normal processing cadence), an FSIS weekly update showing progress, or company/FSIS notes indicating effectiveness checks completed.\n\nWhat would move me down: Any recall expansion, reclassification, distribution tracing issues, or signs of FSIS backlog/slow closures across similar recalls.\n\nSummary: Conditional on still being Active at day ~74, I expect a moderate hazard of closure over the next ~3 weeks. I lean slightly Yes but keep considerable weight on the current Active status persisting into early June.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the USDA-posted recall by LPK1 of its ready-to-eat chicken caesar wrap for misbranding and an undeclared allergen issued February 24, 2025 be closed before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nFood Safety News: [Chicken Caesar wraps sold in vending machines in Washington recalled over undeclared fish](https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2025/02/chicken-caesar-wraps-sold-in-veding-machines-in-washington-recalled-over-undeclared-fish/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the status of the recall posted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is changed from Active to Closed on [this page](https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/lpk1-recalls-ready-eat-chicken-caesar-wrap-products-due-misbranding-and-undeclared) before June 1, 2025. If the recall is still shown as Active when the link is accessed by Metaculus on or after that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nLPK1, a Renton, Washington establishment, is recalling approximately 303 pounds of ready-to-eat chicken Caesar wrap products.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
