    "review": "Both forecasters emphasize the same two key constraints I used: the gradualist mandate and the short runway. Forecaster 2 adds a useful framing that early post-election actions typically align tightly with campaign platforms, which strengthens the case against a quick date announcement. Forecaster 3 is right that announcing a date is cheaper than holding a vote and that National Day–style symbolism could matter, but I find the external-pressure argument (e.g., U.S./Trump interest) less compelling for Greenland’s cautious leadership. Overall, their reasoning nudges me slightly downward from my prior because it reinforces that a post-election gradualist coalition has little incentive to lock in a binding date imminently.",
    "rationale": "Time remaining is about 60 days. The new government’s ‘gradualist’ mandate implies prioritizing institutional and economic readiness before committing to a binding referendum date. In Greenland’s context, that usually means advancing constitutional work and economic plans first. Announcing a specific date would constrain the government and risk internal coalition friction, especially if moderates/unionists are part of the coalition. The resolution standard also requires an announcement by an authority with the power to schedule, not just an intent statement—another practical hurdle. While a symbolic June 21 (National Day) announcement is a plausible ‘Yes’ scenario, the lack of signals so far and the political logic of gradualism make it unlikely. Base rates for post-election independence referenda timing also point to months-to-years of preparatory work before dates are set. I’m trimming my estimate slightly to reflect the weight of these considerations. I would move up if credible reporting surfaced of a coalition deal or government bill that specifies a referendum timetable/date or if leaders trail a National Day date announcement. I would move down if officials publicly commit to deferring any date until completion of discrete prerequisites without timelines.",
