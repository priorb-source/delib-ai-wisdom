    "review": "Both analyses add useful specifics I hadn’t cited: the seat cut from 93 to 76 (39 for a majority), the current composition (Cons 50, Lab 16, Reform 4, Greens 3, Ind 3), the Conservative leader not re‑standing, and the plausible effect of boundary changes shifting weight toward Northampton. I also found convincing the emphasis that Lib Dems appear relatively weak locally, which undercuts the research assistant’s general note about Lib Dem targeting as a threat in this particular council. Both forecasters correctly stress Reform’s likely role as a splitter rather than a seat‑winner given historically thin coverage, while noting that their presence still harms the Conservatives in tight rural wards.\n\nPoints I’d push back on or nuance: Reform holding 4 seats pre‑election suggests a non‑trivial local footprint; if they field broader slates this time, the Tory vote split risk in rural wards is real. The boundary changes inject variance and could make a Labour plurality more plausible if Northampton gains relative representation, though we lack ward‑level notionals. On balance, I find their argument that Conservatives remain likeliest to be largest—thanks to rural geography and opposition fragmentation—more persuasive than my earlier weighting of Lib Dem threat.\n",
    "rationale": "Baseline remains that 2021 was a high‑water mark for the Conservatives in a council with strong rural Conservative lean. The national environment (Labour lead; Reform polling high) and boundary changes point toward losses and a likely move toward No Overall Control. However, the local context—weak Lib Dem footprint, opposition fragmentation across Labour/Greens/Reform, and multi‑member rural wards—still favors the Conservatives to finish as the largest group even if their majority disappears.\n\nRelative to my prior, I’m shading up slightly because: (1) evidence/argument that Lib Dems are not a major local force reduces the Conservatives’ vulnerability in rural/market‑town wards; (2) while Reform’s presence matters, their seat‑winning potential remains limited and coverage may be patchy; and (3) even with boundary‑driven uncertainty, Labour likely needs to dominate Northampton and pick up additional peri‑urban gains to overtake, which is possible but not the base case. I’m not higher because boundary changes increasing Northampton’s weight and any broad Reform slates would materially increase the chance Labour becomes largest.\n",
