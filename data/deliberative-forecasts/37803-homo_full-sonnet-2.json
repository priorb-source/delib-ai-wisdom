    "review": "The other forecasters present strong, well-reasoned analyses that are remarkably consistent with my own initial assessment. All three of us independently arrived at very similar low probabilities (7-10%), which increases my confidence in this range. Forecaster 2 raises an interesting point about 'technical restoration without policy implications' - the site could theoretically come back online through administrative processes without representing a policy shift. Forecaster 3's point about 'technical/operational necessity' is also worth considering, though I find it unlikely given the administration's explicit hostility to climate programs. Both forecasters emphasize the 42-day timeframe more strongly than I did initially, correctly noting this is extremely short for bureaucratic action. Forecaster 3's mention of the domain potentially being 'reassigned' suggests the situation could become even more permanent than just being offline. The consensus on the systematic nature of the dismantling beyond just the website takedown is compelling - the $377M funding removal, policy rescissions, and explicit statements all point to a coordinated effort, not just a symbolic website change. I found their reasoning convincing overall, particularly regarding the very short timeframe and the depth of policy commitment demonstrated by multiple concurrent actions.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other analyses, I'm updating slightly downward. The consensus among all three forecasters (7-10% range) suggests we've accurately captured the key factors. The other forecasters correctly emphasize that 42 days is an extremely short window - even shorter than I initially weighted. For comparison, the site has already been down for ~120 days with zero restoration signals, so expecting change in just 6 more weeks requires a significant shift in circumstances. The systematic nature of the policy dismantling is also more significant than I initially emphasized: this isn't just about one website, but part of coordinated actions across funding, executive orders, and military service policies. Historical precedent from 2017-2021 strongly suggests multi-year offline periods. However, I'm not going to the very bottom of the range (7%) because genuine uncertainty remains around administrative processes, potential legal interventions, or unexpected political developments. Congressional hearings in June, while unlikely to produce immediate action, aren't impossible to generate pressure. I'm settling on 8%, matching Forecaster 2's assessment, which appropriately balances the overwhelming evidence for continued offline status against the non-zero possibility of unexpected developments in a 42-day window.",
