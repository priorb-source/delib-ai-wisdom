  "information": "As of early June 2025, the Republican primary field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race includes Congressman Byron Donalds, who launched his campaign with an endorsement from former President Donald Trump. On the Democratic side, former U.S. Representative David Jolly, a former Republican and critic of Donald Trump, announced his candidacy on June 5, 2025. Governor Ron DeSantis, who is term-limited, has not endorsed a successor in the Republican primary.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 26 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Casey DeSantis keeps options open for the 2026 race but refrains from announcing in June, continuing public appearances and fundraising through allied committees without a formal candidacy.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "She formally launches in late June to leverage end-of-quarter (Q2) fundraising optics or to counter-program against Byron Donalds’ momentum and Trump’s endorsement.",
    "rationale": "Baseline: The default is no announcement; most 2026 gubernatorial hopefuls can afford to wait until later in 2025. The research assistant notes Byron Donalds has already announced with a Trump endorsement, and David Jolly joined the Democratic side on June 5. Governor Ron DeSantis has not endorsed. These factors cut both ways, but on balance they discourage a rapid Casey DeSantis entry before July 1. Reasons against a near-term announcement: (1) Trump’s endorsement of Donalds raises the political cost for Casey to jump in quickly, especially given the intra-party dynamics between the DeSantis and Trump camps. (2) If she planned to defy a Trump-aligned contender, she likely would have signaled more aggressively ahead of Donalds’ launch; the absence of such signals by early June suggests caution. (3) She has never run for office before; building a statewide operation typically takes longer and doesn’t require a June declaration. Reasons for a near-term announcement: (1) A pre–July 1 launch could capitalize on the Q2 fundraising deadline and demonstrate strength. (2) If internal polling showed her competitive despite Trump’s endorsement of Donalds, she might move sooner to consolidate donors and institutional support. Why not higher? The combination of Trump’s backing for a declared opponent and lack of clear pre-announcement signals makes a June launch unlikely. Why not lower? Persistent speculation about her interest, the strategic value of a Q2 fundraising splash, and the relatively open GOP field (no endorsement from the governor) leave a non-trivial chance of a quick pivot. What would move me up: credible reporting of an imminent announcement, formation of a principal campaign committee or unmistakable staffing moves, major donor events scheduled before June 30, or signals from Ron DeSantis suggesting support. What would move me down: explicit statements from Casey DeSantis ruling out a June announcement, additional heavyweight GOP entrants consolidating anti-Donalds support, or fresh polls showing a prohibitive Donalds lead dampening donor interest in a Casey bid this month.",

These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Casey DeSantis announces her candidacy for governor of Florida before July 1, 2025. If no such announcement has been made before that date, the question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nAs of early June 2025, the Republican primary field for the 2026 Florida gubernatorial race includes Congressman Byron Donalds, who launched his campaign with an endorsement from former President Donald Trump.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
