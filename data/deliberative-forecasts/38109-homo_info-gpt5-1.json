    "review": "- Forecaster 2: I agree the “every day” criterion makes the conjunction fragile and that small daily risks compound. The Nevada case and league opposition are legitimate tail risks; a TRO or preliminary injunction that prompts even a brief pause would flip this to No. Where I’m less convinced is the likelihood that a Nevada-specific ruling would force a nationwide pause; Kalshi can likely geofence quickly, and a state court’s reach beyond Nevada is limited. Still, the possibility of a conservative, short-term platform-wide pause is nonzero.\n- Forecaster 3: I agree that MLB plays essentially every day in June and that automation plus strong incentives favor continuity. However, I don’t find the claim that the legal action is mainly about political markets persuasive given the linked article references leagues raising concerns—this looks sports-focused. That weakens the argument that legal risk is immaterial. The compounding-risk point is solid.\n- New insights considered: (1) The strict “every day” requirement and compounding operational risk deserve more weight. (2) The Nevada case could create a brief pause even if geofencing is feasible. (3) Track record since mid-April suggests the operational systems are already in place and reliable.",
    "rationale": "Baseline remains strong: Kalshi has been listing daily MLB markets since April 17, sports appear central to recent growth, and MLB has games every day in June. The platform only needs one MLB game market per day. \n\nDownside risks that keep this below the mid-80s: (a) Legal—the Nevada proceeding could lead to a TRO or interim step that prompts a short platform-wide pause while Kalshi implements geofencing or compliance changes; (b) Operational—a single listing lapse or brief outage could break the streak over a 30-day run; (c) Regulatory—low-probability CFTC-related action or internal caution spilling over to sports. \n\nBalancing these, I still view a nationwide pause as unlikely and geofencing as a ready mitigation, but I’m giving slightly more weight than before to the conjunction risk and to the chance of a cautious, one-day pause tied to the Nevada case. Accordingly, I trim my forecast modestly from 86% to 80%.",
