    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Leaning Yes: summer schedules are largely published by late May and Erbil typically sits around the low-to-mid 30s destinations in peak season, which is just above the >31 threshold.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Several seasonal routes (e.g., Turkey coastal, Egypt leisure, parts of Iran/Levant) fail to materialize on flightsfrom.com’s schedule listing or are suspended before July 1, leaving the count at 31 or fewer. Security or regulatory disruptions (e.g., temporary suspensions to Beirut, Iran, or Saudi routes) could also dip the total below the threshold.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "All currently scheduled summer routes remain listed on July 1 and seasonal additions (Turkey coast, Gulf, Egypt, Saudi) push or keep EBL’s total above 31; possibly a couple of late-added seasonal routes appear on flightsfrom.com before July 1.",
    "rationale": "- Definition: Metaculus will check the flightsfrom.com EBL page on/after July 1, 2025. The question resolves Yes if the listed nonstop destinations are >31 (i.e., 32+). FlightsFrom typically includes seasonal services that are in the published schedule.\n- Base rate/status quo: Erbil (EBL) is the busiest airport in the Kurdistan Region with broad Gulf connectivity (DXB/SHJ/AUH/DOH/KWI/BAH/MCT + multiple Saudi cities), domestic Iraqi links (BGW/BSR/NJF/ISU), Turkish cities (IST/SAW plus seasonal AYT/ADB/BJV, sometimes others), Levant/Egypt (AMM/BEY/CAI/HBE/SSH seasonal), and some Iran and Europe/Scandinavia diaspora routes. In peak summer EBL’s destination count is typically in the low-to-mid 30s, and July 1 falls at peak season, favoring a count just above the 31 cutoff.\n- Timing: With ~5–6 weeks left, most summer schedules are already loaded; large net changes are less likely. Thus I put extra weight on the status quo.\n- Upward pressures: Seasonal Turkey coast/Egypt leisure routes and Saudi/Umrah services, plus diaspora routes to Scandinavia/Germany often peak in summer. The provided Shafaq News framing (“Promising Season”) is directionally supportive, though not specific.\n- Downward risks: FlightsFrom may exclude some charter-like services if not filed as scheduled; any late security/regulatory suspensions (e.g., Iran, Beirut, or certain Saudi routes) could trim the list. Given the threshold is close, a handful of removals could matter.\n- Why not higher: I don’t have a verified current count from flightsfrom.com today; if the true current total were 30–31, there isn’t much time to add sufficient new destinations. Also, volatility in a few sensitive markets could push the count under.\n- Why not lower: July is the annual maximum for scheduled leisure traffic, and EBL’s network breadth across the Gulf, Turkey, domestic Iraq, and select Europe/Levant markets makes a figure above 31 plausible.\n- What would move me up: Independent confirmation that flightsfrom.com currently lists ≥34 destinations; announcements of additional seasonal routes loaded into schedules before July.\n- What would move me down: Verified current listing at 29–31; news of route suspensions (e.g., Iran/Levant/Saudi/Turkey leisure) or regulatory disruptions.\n- Research assistant: No additional information was provided, so this relies on base-rate reasoning and typical summer patterns for EBL.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill there be greater than 31 direct flight destinations from Erbil, Iraq on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nShafaq News: [Kurdistan Summer 2025: A Promising Season](https://shafaq.com/en/Kurdistan/Kurdistan-Summer-2025-A-Promising-Season)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if there are greater than 31 direct flight destinations listed at the [All scheduled direct (non-stop) flights from Erbil (EBL)](https://www.flightsfrom.com/EBL) tracker when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-23.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
