    "review": "The other two forecasters provide excellent, reinforcing analyses that create a strong consensus for a low-probability outcome. We all converged on similar core arguments: the high threshold for a Level 4 advisory, the short timeframe, and the lack of specific triggering events like an ordered departure of embassy staff or the closure of the international airport in Addis Ababa. I found Forecaster 2's quantification of the base rate (a ~1-2% chance of upgrade over a two-month period for a typical Level 3 country) to be a particularly useful anchor. Forecaster 3's systematic breakdown of the specific catalysts that are currently absent was also very compelling. The most powerful argument, raised by both but emphasized by Forecaster 2, was the recency of the State Department's review on April 30, 2025. The fact that the advisory was explicitly maintained at Level 3 just days ago, likely with knowledge of the developing situation that led to the May 1 sanctions, is a very strong piece of evidence that the bar for an upgrade is extremely high.",
    "rationale": "I am slightly lowering my forecast from 10% to 9%. The reasoning from the other forecasters has not fundamentally changed my view but has strengthened my conviction in the stability of the status quo. Specifically, I am placing more weight on the State Department's April 30, 2025 review. This recent decision to maintain the Level 3 advisory acts as a powerful signal of bureaucratic inertia and establishes a high baseline of stability. For an upgrade to Level 4 to occur before July 1, there would need to be a dramatic and qualitative deterioration in the security situation, beyond the ongoing regional conflicts which are already ring-fenced with specific Level 4 warnings. The arguments from my peers solidified my view that the current situation, including the recent sanctions, is likely already 'priced in' to the current Level 3 advisory. My updated forecast of 9% better reflects the high threshold for a change in such a short timeframe, while still acknowledging the significant tail risk of rapid escalation in a volatile region.",
