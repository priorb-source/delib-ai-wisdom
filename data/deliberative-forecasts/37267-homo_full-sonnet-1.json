    "review": "The convergence on 10% across all three forecasts is striking and adds confidence to this probability range. All forecasters identified the same key evidence: the April 30 review maintaining Level 3, Ethiopia's downgrade trajectory since 2023, the 1-2.5% base rate over 2 months, localized rather than nationwide violence, and absence of typical upgrade catalysts. Forecaster 3's insight about the 'compartmentalized nature' of violence is particularly valuable - the State Department's regional Level 4 warnings suggest they view the threats as manageable rather than requiring nationwide action. Forecaster 2's emphasis on the 'relatively short 2-month timeframe' reinforces why absent a major catalyst, policy changes are unlikely. No forecaster raised evidence I hadn't considered, but the framing helped clarify the reasoning. The May 1 sanctions timing is notable - they happened just yesterday, so we're at the very beginning of any potential deterioration period. However, sanctions represent a measured diplomatic response, not an indication of imminent crisis requiring travel advisory changes.",
    "rationale": "Upon deliberation, I'm maintaining 10% as my forecast. The probability should be meaningfully above the pure base rate of 1-2.5% because: (1) sanctions announced literally yesterday indicate active concern about deteriorating conditions; (2) multiple active conflict zones (Tigray, Amhara, Oromia, Gambella, Benishangul-Gumuz) create compound risks; (3) Ethiopia has recent history of Level 4 status, showing capacity for that level of instability. However, the probability shouldn't be much higher because: (1) the April 30 review just occurred and explicitly maintained Level 3 status; (2) no clear catalysts exist - no attacks on foreigners, embassy evacuations, coups, or airport closures; (3) the trend since 2023 has been improvement, not deterioration; (4) violence remains regionally contained with existing Level 4 warnings already capturing the worst areas; (5) the 2-month timeframe is quite short for major policy shifts absent crisis events. The convergence among all three forecasters at 10% suggests this probability appropriately balances the low base rate with Ethiopia-specific risk factors.",
