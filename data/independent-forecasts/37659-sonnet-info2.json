  "information": "Project 2025 is a 922-page strategic document authored by the Heritage Foundation. Its stated aims include restructuring the US government and shrinking the federal bureaucracy. Specific objectives mentioned in news reports include dismantling the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), removing funding for the United Nations Human Rights Council and the W.H.O., allowing political appointees to personally authorize appropriated funding, reducing education programs, and imposing higher tariffs on imports from various countries.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 46 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Uncertain - depends on current count of objectives marked as 'Done' which is unknown. The Trump administration has been in office for approximately 4 months as of mid-May 2025, during which time some Project 2025 objectives have likely been marked as complete, but the exact current count is unavailable.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The tracker shows fewer than 120 objectives as 'Done' on July 1, 2025. This occurs if: the current count is significantly below 120 with insufficient time to reach the threshold; the tracker applies conservative criteria for marking objectives as 'Done'; implementation faces resistance or delays; or the pace of executive actions and policy implementation slows in months 5-6 of the administration.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The tracker shows 120 or more objectives as 'Done' on July 1, 2025. This occurs if: the Trump administration has aggressively implemented Project 2025 policies through executive orders, appointments, and regulatory changes; the tracker has been actively marking completed objectives; the current count is already close to or above 100; or the implementation pace accelerates in the final 46 days before the resolution date.",
    "rationale": "This forecast faces significant uncertainty due to lack of visibility into the current baseline - specifically, how many objectives are already marked as 'Done' as of May 16, 2025. The Trump administration began approximately 116 days ago, and July 1 represents 162 days into the term. Early administration periods typically see accelerated policy implementation through executive orders, personnel appointments, and regulatory changes - the types of actions that could quickly satisfy Project 2025 objectives. The research assistant notes that Project 2025 includes objectives like dismantling agencies, defunding international organizations, and imposing tariffs - some of which can be accomplished relatively quickly through executive action. However, several factors create uncertainty: (1) The tracker is operated by the Keep_Track subreddit, which monitors these policies from an oppositional perspective, and their methodology for marking objectives as 'Done' is unclear - they could be either comprehensive or conservative in their classifications; (2) A 922-page document likely contains hundreds of distinct objectives, and 120 represents a substantial portion; (3) While early administration actions are typically front-loaded, maintaining momentum becomes harder over time. The 120 threshold suggests this is meant to be a meaningful benchmark - neither trivially easy nor impossibly high. If the current count is 80-100, reaching 120 is quite plausible over 46 days (about 0.4-0.9 objectives per day). If it's below 60, acceleration would be needed. If it's already above 110, the outcome is nearly certain. Without knowing the current baseline, I'm assigning roughly even odds slightly favoring 'No' given status quo bias and the principle that change typically occurs more slowly than anticipated. My forecast would increase significantly if current data showed 90+ objectives already complete, or decrease if the current count is below 70.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the Project 2025 Tracker classify at least 120 objectives as \"Done\" on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe 2025 Tracker is a project of the Keep_Track subreddit and is explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Keep_Track/comments/1ii7tbr/project_2025_tracker_is_now_live/).\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the [Project 2025 Tracker](https://www.project2025.observer/) has ≥120 Objectives classified as Done when accessed by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If it is less than 120, this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nProject 2025 is a 922-page strategic document authored by the Heritage Foundation.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
