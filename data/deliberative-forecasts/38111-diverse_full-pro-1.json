    "review": "Both other forecasters presented compelling arguments for a more moderate probability, which I found persuasive. Forecaster 2 rightly emphasized the general principle of diplomatic inertia and the frequency with which stated intentions are delayed, a factor I had not weighted heavily enough. Forecaster 3's analysis was particularly insightful, highlighting two key points I had overlooked: 1) a structural analysis of the 46 non-recognizing countries, correctly identifying them as 'hard cases' with long-standing reasons for their position, making them more resistant to change; and 2) a stronger emphasis on the conditionality of French President Macron's statements, framing them as a significant political 'off-ramp' that could easily push an announcement beyond the June deadline. Their healthy skepticism regarding the specifics of the Axios report on Malta also served as a valuable check on my own interpretation.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing my peers' analyses, I am revising my forecast downward. My initial forecast of 75% was too optimistic and overweighted the positive signals from the upcoming conference and specific country statements, while underestimating the significant structural and political headwinds. The arguments from Forecaster 3 were particularly convincing. The remaining 46 non-recognizing states are not a random sample; they are largely Western-aligned nations who have actively resisted this step for decades. Overcoming this deep-seated policy position in a single month is a high bar. Furthermore, President Macron's explicit 'conditions' provide a ready-made justification for a delay, allowing France and its allies to claim progress at the conference without making a formal recognition in June. While the conference remains a powerful catalyst and a single recognition (e.g., from Malta) is still plausible, the probability of the event slipping into July or being postponed is higher than I first assessed. I believe a 'Yes' outcome remains the most likely scenario, but the path to 'No' is much clearer and more probable than I initially thought. Therefore, I am reducing my forecast from 75% to 68% to better reflect these countervailing risks.",
