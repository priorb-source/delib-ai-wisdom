    "review": "Forecaster 3 raised a critical point I had not considered: the UK general election on July 4, 2025, which places the UK government in 'purdah' (a pre-election period restricting major policy announcements). This substantially reduces the likelihood that the UK, despite joining the initiative, will announce recognition in June specifically. This is a material constraint on one of the most likely candidates.\n\nForecaster 2's optimism at 75% appears excessive. They interpret the 'initiative' as if decisions are essentially made with only execution remaining, but initiatives typically involve extended planning, coordination, and consensus-building rather than immediate action. The May 20 announcement date leaves only 11 days before June begins—extremely tight for such consequential diplomatic decisions. While I appreciate their point about the 'permission structure' from Spain, Ireland, and Norway creating momentum, this momentum doesn't necessarily translate to action within a specific 30-day window.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis is more grounded in practical diplomatic constraints. Their identification of alternative candidates (Malta, Luxembourg, Belgium, Caribbean/Pacific states) is helpful, though these remain lower-probability scenarios given base rates and lack of signals. Their point about France's historical preference for coordination reinforces that even if France moves, they may wait to coordinate timing with the UK or others, which the purdah constraint now complicates.\n\nThe strongest argument for maintaining some probability: (1) France could act independently, (2) smaller states could move on shorter timelines, (3) diplomatic momentum is real even if timing is uncertain. Against: (1) UK constrained by purdah, (2) only 11 days between initiative and June, (3) no specific June timeline reported, (4) 'initiative' suggests planning phase.",
    "rationale": "The purdah constraint on the UK is a significant negative update that I had not previously considered. This removes the most plausible candidate for a June announcement. However, this doesn't eliminate France as a potential actor, nor does it preclude smaller EU states or other countries from moving independently on different timelines.\n\nThe core tension remains between: (1) Real diplomatic momentum from the Franco-British initiative and recent European recognitions, and (2) The narrow 30-day window combined with the typical pace of such major foreign policy decisions.\n\nForecaster 2's 75% probability appears to overweight the signal from the initiative while underweighting the practical constraints of timing and process. Diplomatic coordination, parliamentary considerations, and international sequencing typically require more than 11 days of lead time before a given month.\n\nForecaster 3's analysis aligns closely with mine and adds valuable context. The base rate argument is particularly important: most months see no new recognitions, and the remaining non-recognizers are concentrated among cautious actors.\n\nGiven the purdah constraint, I should update slightly downward from my initial 30%, but not dramatically, as France and other actors remain possibilities. I'll adjust to 28% to reflect the UK constraint while maintaining that there's still meaningful probability from other potential actors.",
