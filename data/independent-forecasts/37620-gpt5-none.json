    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 20 days (until 2025-06-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Kadyrov remains Head of the Chechen Republic through June 1, 2025.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Kadyrov’s public statement about wanting to step down is walked back or left without action; the Kremlin neither accepts a resignation nor announces a replacement, and Kadyrov continues appearing in office (even if on reduced schedule).",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The Kremlin accepts Kadyrov’s resignation or removes him, and appoints an acting head before June 1; or he becomes incapacitated/dies and a decree names an acting head, ending his tenure before the deadline.",
    "rationale": "- Timing: With ~3 weeks left, a formal change would require a public resignation/acceptance and a presidential decree appointing an acting head. Such moves can happen quickly in Russia, but they are usually telegraphed by credible leaks or confirmed statements. As of May 12, none are reported beyond Kadyrov’s May 6 remark.\n- Status quo bias: Kadyrov has previously hinted at stepping down (multiple times over the past decade) without actually leaving office. Historically, these statements have not led to immediate change. The Kremlin values stability in Chechnya and may avoid a rushed transition absent a pressing catalyst.\n- Contradictory pressures: Recent years featured persistent rumors about Kadyrov’s health and grooming of loyalists/relatives, which keep the medium-term exit probability elevated. The recent public comment raises near-term odds somewhat. However, legal and political constraints (e.g., finding an acceptable successor; maintaining control) and the short window limit the chance of execution before June 1.\n- Evidence: The only concrete new input is the May 6 report that he said he wants to step down. My research assistant had no additional information, suggesting no subsequent definitive Kremlin move has yet surfaced.\nWhy not higher: If a transition were imminent, we would likely see rapid follow-up (Kremlin comment, local elite maneuvering, federal appointment chatter). The lack of such signals a week later plus Kadyrov’s history of similar statements argue against a quick change within 20 days.\nWhy not lower: Publicly stating a desire to resign in this system is unusual and implies at least some non-trivial chance of a pre-planned handover or a health-driven exit. Sudden removals or emergency appointments do occur, so a small but real probability remains.\nWhat would move me up: Credible reports that Putin accepted a resignation; a presidential decree naming an acting head; clear evidence of severe incapacitation; or authoritative reporting on a chosen successor with imminent timing.\nWhat would move me down: Kadyrov or the Kremlin explicitly denying any pending resignation; visible, routine appearances by Kadyrov reaffirming continuity; absence of successor chatter through late May.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ramzan Kadyrov cease to be head of the Chechen Republic before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Moscow Times: [Kadyrov Says He Wants to Step Down as Chechen Leader](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2025/05/06/kadyrov-says-he-wants-to-step-down-as-chechen-leader-a88991)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) Ramzan Kadyrov ceases to be the [Head of the Chechen Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_the_Chechen_Republic) before June 1, 2025, for any reason. Otherwise, this question resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-12.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
