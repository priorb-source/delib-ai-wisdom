    "review": "The other two forecasters presented compelling arguments and new information that I had not considered, leading me to significantly revise my forecast. Forecaster 2's points were particularly impactful: the reporting that Ralph Norman is seriously considering a gubernatorial run and that his office has explicitly denied plans for a Senate run are crucial pieces of evidence. This shifts the narrative from a simple lack of preparation to a clear focus on an alternative political path. Forecaster 3's analysis about the lack of procedural urgency—with the official filing period still being far off in Spring 2026—was also highly convincing. It effectively dismantles any strategic reason for Norman to make a surprise declaration in the next 30 days. Both analyses correctly identify that the complete absence of campaign infrastructure (FEC filings, staff, etc.) is a very strong signal. In comparison, my initial forecast of 15% was too high, as it was based only on the possibility of a challenge without the crucial context of Norman's other ambitions and his office's direct denial.",
    "rationale": "I am substantially updating my forecast downwards from 15% to 4%. The primary reason for this significant change is the new information presented by the other forecasters, particularly Forecaster 2. The revelation that Norman is actively exploring a run for Governor provides a compelling alternative explanation for his public activities and completely reframes the lack of Senate campaign preparations. It's not just a delay; it's a different goal. His office's explicit denial of a Senate run is a direct and powerful piece of evidence against a 'Yes' outcome. Furthermore, as Forecaster 3 argued, there is no strategic or procedural deadline forcing his hand in the next 30 days. The filing deadline is nearly a year away. A path to a 'Yes' vote now requires Norman to abruptly abandon a gubernatorial bid he is reportedly serious about, reverse his office's public statements, and launch a massive statewide campaign with no groundwork, all within a month. This sequence of events is extraordinarily unlikely. I am maintaining a small, non-zero probability of 4% to account for the unpredictable nature of politics and the small chance that the gubernatorial exploration is a feint or that a major, unforeseen event could radically change his calculations. However, the combined weight of the available evidence points overwhelmingly toward 'No'.",
