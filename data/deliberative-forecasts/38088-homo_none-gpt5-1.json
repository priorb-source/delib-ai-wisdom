    "review": "Both forecasters anchor on a mid-30s U.S. base rate around rank ~250 and argue that (a) the most recent snapshot being non-U.S. tilts slightly toward No, but (b) 2025 U.S. equity momentum and potential USD strength marginally raise the odds of a U.S. occupant by July 1. They also emphasize day-to-day churn near the cutoff. The explicit USD argument is a useful addition I underweighted. I agree churn implies the July 1 snapshot should hew closer to base rates than to any single late-April observation, especially given a crypto-linked current occupant whose rank may be more volatile. I still think 38–40% is a bit high absent concrete evidence that 245–255 skews U.S. right now, but their points justify nudging up from my prior.",
    "rationale": "- Time left: About one month until July 1, so there’s room for modest reshuffling near rank 250. \n- Status quo: Apr 30’s #250 was Italian (Giancarlo Devasini). That slightly favors No but is a weak anchor given daily churn and crypto-linked volatility.\n- Base rate: U.S. share around the mid-ranks is typically in the mid-30s percent, below a majority but still the single largest national cohort.\n- Market/currency context: U.S. equities have been relatively strong in 2025, and any USD firmness marginally favors U.S.-domiciled fortunes in USD terms versus non-U.S. peers. These effects push slightly upward from the pure base rate.\n- Net: My initial weighting may have overemphasized the late-April non-U.S. snapshot. Given expected churn and plausible U.S./USD tailwinds, I move up a few points but stay below 40% without direct evidence of a U.S. cluster around ranks 245–255.\n- Update triggers: I’d move higher if late-June snapshots show multiple U.S. names hovering near 245–255 or if U.S. markets/ USD outperform into month-end; lower if non-U.S. names persist around that band or if U.S. assets underperform.\nChange: Up from 32% to 36%, reflecting modestly higher weight on market/FX tailwinds and churn reducing the April anchor’s influence.",
