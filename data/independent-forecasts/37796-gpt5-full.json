  "information": "Several jurisdictions on the FATF grey list are actively seeking removal. The Nigerian government is working to exit the list by the end of May 2025, with its Minister of Interior emphasizing the administration's commitment to improving financial transparency. South Africa's National Treasury has stated that the country has addressed or largely addressed 20 of its 22 action items and aims to resolve the remaining two by June 2025, for a potential exit from the list by October 2025. Mozambique completed its technical reforms, and an FATF on-site visit, which is a prerequisite for removal, reportedly took place in April 2025 with positive feedback.\n\nThere are potential new additions to the grey list. The British Virgin Islands underwent a mutual-evaluation follow-up that found major gaps, and its grace period for remediation expired in February 2025; the UK has signalled it will not block a listing. Separately, India is preparing to submit new intelligence to the FATF concerning Pakistan's terror infrastructure, aiming to have Pakistan re-listed after its removal in October 2022. The most recent changes to the list occurred in February 2025, when Laos and Nepal were added and the Philippines was removed.\n\nHistorical data on FATF plenaries shows consistent changes to the grey list. Since the current monitoring process was adopted in 2018, there have been 17 plenary meetings up to February 2025. Of these 17 meetings, only one—the October 2020 plenary—concluded without any additions or removals. That session was a virtual meeting delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and was noted to have focused on policy work rather than country evaluations. For a country to be removed, it must complete its action plan and then undergo a successful on-site visit to verify the implementation of reforms.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 4–5 weeks (FATF June 2025 Plenary)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No change to the grey list; answer resolves No.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Mozambique’s on-site visit does not meet FATF thresholds or is procedurally scheduled for an October decision; Nigeria and South Africa miss remaining action items or on-site timing; British Virgin Islands’ listing is delayed pending further ICRG process, political clearance, or technical wrangling; no other jurisdictions reach the point of addition/removal in time for June, leading the plenary to defer country changes to October.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "At least one change occurs—for example, FATF removes Mozambique following a positive April on-site verification; or adds the British Virgin Islands after its grace period lapsed and major deficiencies persist; or a surprise addition/removal (e.g., Nigeria completes its plan rapidly and clears an on-site in time; another jurisdiction is added based on regional body findings).",
    "rationale": "Base rates strongly favor a change: since 2018, only 1 of 17 FATF plenaries reportedly concluded with no grey-list additions/removals, implying roughly a 94% historical chance of some change. The February 2025 plenary already made changes (Laos, Nepal added; Philippines removed), and there are multiple plausible June candidates.\nEvidence pointing to removals: Mozambique reportedly completed its technical reforms and had an FATF on-site visit in April 2025 with positive feedback; this fits the usual sequence for removal at the next plenary. South Africa indicates 20/22 items addressed with an October target, so June removal is unlikely. Nigeria aims to exit by end-May; a June removal would require both completion and an on-site, which is tight but not impossible.\nEvidence pointing to additions: The British Virgin Islands’ follow-up identified major gaps; a grace period expired in February 2025, and the UK has signaled it won’t block a listing—making a June addition plausible. An Indian push to re-list Pakistan exists but appears less likely to materialize quickly given FATF’s evidentiary and process requirements.\nWhy not higher? Procedural and timing risks: on-site results must meet FATF standards and be processed in time; the plenary could prioritize policy work or defer contentious listings; Mozambique’s removal could slip to October; BVI listing might await further ICRG steps. Occasionally, plenaries do end without list changes.\nWhy not lower? Multiple paths to Yes (Mozambique removal or BVI addition alone would suffice), plus strong base-rate evidence that most plenaries change the list. The presence of at least one credible removal candidate and one credible addition candidate increases the likelihood of some change.\nWhat would move the forecast up: Credible reporting that FATF’s Secretariat recommended Mozambique’s removal post on-site; confirmation of an ICRG decision advancing BVI for immediate listing; reports of Nigeria completing all actions and scheduling/finishing an on-site before the plenary.\nWhat would move it down: Reporting that Mozambique’s on-site identified unresolved deficiencies or that its consideration is slated for October; signals that BVI consideration is delayed; indications the June plenary agenda is crowded with standards/policy items with country decisions deferred.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"grey list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nAML Intelligence (February 2025) [UPDATE: Philippines removed from FATF ‘grey list’ as Laos, Nepal added to watchlist](https://www.amlintelligence.com/2025/02/breaking-fatf-grey-list-update-laos-and-nepal-added-the-philippines-removed/)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
