    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my priors: CDC uses Level 3 sparingly for vaccine-preventable, vector-borne diseases; yellow fever typically elicits Level 1–2 guidance emphasizing vaccination. They stress the very short timeline and the high bar for escalation (sustained urban transmission, traveler cases, vaccine access failures, health system strain). Forecaster 3’s clarification that CDC THNs are effectively 1–3 reinforces that “>2” means reaching Level 3, not some higher category. No new concrete epidemiological evidence was introduced, but the emphasis on vaccine access constraints and traveler case signals as necessary precursors is a helpful refinement.",
    "rationale": "Given the alignment across independent analyses and the short 5–6 week window, I’m nudging my forecast down slightly. The combination required for a Level 3 upgrade—documented urban spread, significant traveler risk despite precautions, and/or vaccine access problems—seems unlikely to manifest and prompt CDC action before June 1. Media framing of an economic emergency is not, by itself, sufficient for CDC to move to Level 3. I’m trimming from 11% to 9% to reflect the strong base-rate/inertia argument and the consensus that Level 3 for yellow fever in Colombia within this window is uncommon, while retaining a modest tail risk for rapid deterioration and a policy shift.",
