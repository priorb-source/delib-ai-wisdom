    "review": "Both forecasters largely mirror my base-rate framing and short-horizon logic. The new, useful emphasis is Forecaster 3’s caution about the seasonality claim—July 1 is the start of Q3, so any purported Q1–Q2 U.S. weakness shouldn’t be leaned on. Both also stress that absent a strong, sustained U.S.-specific tailwind, the cross-sectional base rate around rank ~250 should dominate, with day-of snapshot noise allowing either outcome. I agree. I also find Forecaster 3’s point about month-long persistence plausible but offset by churn near the threshold. Net, this nudges me slightly up from my prior, mostly by down-weighting seasonality rather than changing the base case.",
    "rationale": "Base rate in the 200–300 band implies ~38% for a U.S. #250. Recent trend (U.S. share in top 500 drifting down to ~35%) and the current non-U.S. holder tilt slightly against Yes. With about a month to go and high churn at this rank, single-day resolution adds noise, so the base rate should dominate unless there’s a notable U.S.-specific tailwind (equities/USD) or a clear cluster of U.S. names around 248–252 in late June. I’m discounting the seasonality argument given July 1 is Q3, which removes a minor headwind in my prior. Balancing these, I stay just below the 38% base, reflecting declining U.S. share and current non-U.S. status, but I move up slightly from my previous 35% to reflect the weaker seasonality premise and ongoing U.S. market resilience. I would move up if I see U.S. billionaires clustered at ~249–251 or clear U.S. equity/USD outperformance into late June; down if ex-U.S./commodities lead or the #245–255 cohort stays clearly non-U.S. through late June.",
