  "information": "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's cabinet approval rating fell to a record low of 26% in a March 2025 Asahi newspaper poll. The 14-percentage-point drop followed a controversy involving the distribution of 100,000 yen gift vouchers to 15 lawmakers from the ruling party, which sparked public distrust. Although Ishiba apologized, he stated he used his own 'pocket money' as a sign of appreciation. All 15 lawmakers subsequently returned the vouchers. On the economic front, Ishiba is pursuing a growth-oriented economy driven by wage increases and investment, and has called for cooperation with the Japan Business Federation (Keidanren).",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 32 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Ishiba’s approval rebounds sharply (or Starmer’s drops) so that Morning Consult shows Ishiba ≥ Starmer on or after July 1, 2025. A narrow tie after rounding would also resolve No. Triggers could include a Japanese policy win or economic news that boosts public sentiment, or a UK stumble/scandal that dents Starmer’s standing.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Current gap holds: Starmer remains in the mid-30s (±) while Ishiba stays in the high-20s/low-30s, consistent with his recent slide after the voucher controversy. No major UK shock and continued Japanese public skepticism keep Ishiba below Starmer in Morning Consult’s weekly rolling average published around early July.",
    "rationale": "Evidence and status quo: Morning Consult’s tracker (7-day moving average) typically places UK PM Keir Starmer in the low-to-mid 30s in early 2025, while Japan’s PM Shigeru Ishiba has been trending lower. The research assistant notes an Asahi poll showing Ishiba’s cabinet approval at 26% in March 2025 after a voucher-gift controversy—different question wording than Morning Consult’s leader approval, but directionally consistent with weak support. That controversy and broader LDP trust issues make a sustained, rapid rebound before early July less likely. By contrast, Starmer’s approval, while not high, appears steadier and less scandal-driven, making a sharp one-month drop below Ishiba less likely.\n\nWhy not higher: There’s real upside risk for Ishiba. Japanese approvals can move quickly with economic news (e.g., wage hikes, inflation easing), diplomatic successes, or effective messaging. A 3–5 point rebound plus a 2–3 point Starmer dip could close the gap. Also, Morning Consult reports whole-number percentages; a tie resolves No.\n\nWhy not lower: The voucher scandal created a deep trough for Ishiba per national polling; climbing from the mid-20s to decisively above Starmer in about a month would be atypically large without a major positive shock. UK politics lacks an obvious near-term catalyst for a sudden Starmer plunge of comparable magnitude.\n\nWhat would change my view upward: Continued negative headlines for Ishiba, fresh LDP setbacks, or Morning Consult updates in June keeping him below ~30% while Starmer holds ≥33%.\n\nWhat would change my view downward: A notable Japanese policy/economic win (e.g., strong wage settlement headlines, inflation relief) and/or a diplomatic bump that lifts Ishiba several points; UK economic or political trouble that pulls Starmer into the low 30s or below; any Morning Consult mid/late-June read showing the gap narrowing to ≤1 point.\n\nRA summary used: The assistant highlighted Asahi’s March reading of 26% cabinet approval for Ishiba following the 100,000-yen voucher controversy, suggesting a meaningful erosion in public trust. This supports the view that Ishiba’s Morning Consult approval is likely subdued relative to Starmer heading into late June.\n\nResolution nuances: The question resolves based on Morning Consult’s tracker when checked on or after July 1; a tie counts as No. If, for any reason, Ishiba is not listed at that time, the criterion “Starmer has a higher approval than Ishiba” would not be satisfied, which also implies risk to a Yes outcome.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer have a higher approval rating than Japanese Prime Minister Shiguru Ishiba on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nResolution source updates monthly. According to Morning Consult for January 2025: \"The latest approval ratings are based on data collected from Jan. 21-27, 2025. Ratings reflect a trailing seven-day simple moving average of views among adults in each country surveyed.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if Keir Starmer has a higher approval rating than Shiguru Ishiba according to [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/trackers/global-leader-approval) when checked by Metaculus on or after July 1, 2025. If this not the case (including due to a tie), this resolves as **No**.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's cabinet approval rating fell to a record low of 26% in a March 2025 Asahi newspaper poll.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
