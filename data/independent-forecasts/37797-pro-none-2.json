    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1 month. The outcome will be known after the FATF Plenary meeting concludes in late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No, there will be no changes to the FATF 'black list'. The list will continue to include North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Following the June 2025 Plenary, the FATF publishes its outcomes, and the list of 'High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action' remains unchanged, containing only North Korea, Iran, and Myanmar.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The FATF announces a change to the list, either by removing a current member (e.g., Myanmar) for making significant progress on its action plan, or by adding a new jurisdiction from the 'grey list' due to its failure to address strategic AML/CFT deficiencies.",
    "rationale": "My forecast of a low probability of change is primarily based on the high institutional inertia of the FATF and the significant political and technical thresholds required for any modification to the 'black list'. Changes are infrequent, and the current situation of the listed countries suggests the status quo will prevail.\n\nOf the three blacklisted jurisdictions:\n1.  **North Korea and Iran** are long-standing cases with deep-rooted geopolitical complexities and a demonstrated lack of political will to implement the FATF's required action plans. Their removal in the near term is extremely improbable.\n2.  **Myanmar** was added in October 2022 following the 2021 military coup. The ongoing political instability severely hampers its ability to make the 'significant and sustained progress' required for delisting. Previous FATF statements have noted a lack of progress, making a removal just over 18 months after its listing highly unlikely.\n\nAn addition to the list is the most plausible, yet still improbable, path to a 'Yes' outcome. Escalating a country from the 'grey list' (Jurisdictions under Increased Monitoring) to the 'black list' is a measure of last resort and happens very rarely. It requires a consensus that the jurisdiction is willfully non-compliant over an extended period. My research assistant's report contained no information suggesting any of the ~20 countries on the grey list are on the verge of such an escalation.\n\n**Why the probability is not lower (e.g., 1-2%):** The 10% estimate accounts for tail risks, mainly the possibility of adding a new jurisdiction. This could be triggered by a sudden geopolitical event or a grey-listed country completely ceasing cooperation with the FATF, forcing the Plenary's hand.\n\n**Why the probability is not higher (e.g., 25%+):** The bar for both adding and removing countries is exceptionally high. Given the slow, consensus-driven nature of the FATF and the lack of any public signals pointing to an imminent change, a 'Yes' outcome remains a remote possibility.\n\nI would increase my forecast if credible reports emerged of a grey-listed country's sustained non-cooperation or a major geopolitical development pressuring the FATF to act. Conversely, I would decrease it if pre-plenary statements or leaks indicated a status-quo agenda.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill any jurisdictions be added to or removed from the FATF \"black list\" following the FATF Plenary meeting in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nWikipedia: [Financial Action Task Force blacklist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Action_Task_Force_blacklist)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if following its June 2025 plenary, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has made any changes to its \"High-Risk Jurisdictions subject to a Call for Action\" list, which at the time of this question consists of North Korea, Myanmar and Iran. Resolves according to the [official list](https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/countries/black-and-grey-lists.html).\n\nThe question may resolve according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/help/faq/#definitions) in case the website is unavailable or not timely updated.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-19.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
