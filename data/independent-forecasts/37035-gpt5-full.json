  "information": "Colombia has declared a national health and economic emergency due to a yellow fever outbreak. As of April 2025, reports indicate 79 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since September 2024, with a case fatality rate cited as approximately 45-50%. The government has ordered a mass vaccination campaign and requires travelers to high-risk areas, and those arriving from certain countries like Brazil and Ecuador, to present a yellow fever vaccination card. The Ministry of Health has identified over 400 municipalities as being at 'high' or 'very high' risk.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 2 \"Practice Enhanced Precautions\" travel notice for yellow fever in South America in April 2025, which includes Colombia. This notice advises travelers to get vaccinated. Historically, the CDC has not elevated yellow fever outbreaks beyond Level 2, even during larger epidemics such as those in Brazil (2017–18, with over 2,000 cases) and Nigeria (2019). Level 3 notices are typically reserved for situations with sustained urban transmission, overwhelmed healthcare capacity, or for diseases where risk cannot be mitigated by standard measures like vaccination.\n\nThe current yellow fever outbreak in Colombia is primarily concentrated in rural departments with low tourist traffic, such as Tolima and Putumayo. As of late April 2025, there have been no verified cases of urban transmission in major cities like Bogotá, Medellín, or Cartagena. The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has reported a total of 131 cases and 53 deaths across the Americas in the first three months of 2025, with cases primarily found in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. While neighboring countries have issued alerts, they have not implemented entry bans.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 39 days (until June 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No (Colombia remains at CDC Travel Health Notice Level 2 on June 1, 2025)",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Yellow fever transmission remains primarily sylvatic/rural without sustained urban spread; vaccination campaign progresses; PAHO/CDC situational updates remain at Alert Level 2; no major surge in cases in tourist hubs; healthcare capacity not overwhelmed; thus CDC keeps Colombia at Level 2.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Evidence of sustained urban transmission (e.g., in Bogotá, Medellín, Cartagena) or a rapidly escalating, unmitigatable risk (e.g., severe vaccine shortages leading to high traveler risk, hospital strain, multiple traveler infections) prompts CDC to issue a Warning (Level 3: Avoid nonessential travel) for Colombia before June 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Interpretation note: I’m following the resolution criterion (Yes if the CDC level is greater than 2 on/after June 1), i.e., Level 3 or higher. \n\nBaseline and evidence:\n- Current status is CDC Level 2 for yellow fever in South America, including Colombia. Historically, CDC has kept yellow fever outbreaks at Level 2, even during Brazil’s 2017–18 outbreak (>2,000 cases). Level 3 is rare and typically tied to sustained urban transmission or risks that cannot be mitigated by vaccination.\n- As of late April 2025, Colombia reports ~79 confirmed cases and 36 deaths since Sep 2024 (high CFR likely reflects under-detection), with risk concentrated in rural departments and no verified urban transmission in major cities. PAHO reports regional YF activity in Brazil, Colombia, and Peru but not widespread urban spread. \n- Colombia has declared a national emergency and is running a mass vaccination campaign, adding mitigation that generally supports staying at Level 2.\n\nTime horizon: Only ~5.5 weeks remain. Given CDC’s cautious escalation norms and the need for clear urban transmission or unmitigatable risk to justify Level 3, a change within this short window is unlikely absent a sharp and well-documented deterioration.\n\nWhy not higher: Base rates for CDC Level 3 due to yellow fever are extremely low; no current urban transmission; mitigation via vaccination exists; and CDC just issued a Level 2 regional alert in April—shifting to Level 3 within weeks would require a notable trigger.\n\nWhy not lower: Colombia has declared emergencies, and case counts could rise. If urban clusters emerge or vaccine access collapses (especially in major cities or along travel corridors), CDC could move quickly.\n\nKey watchpoints for upward revision:\n- Confirmed sustained urban transmission in major Colombian cities.\n- Significant traveler infections linked to Colombia or exported cases to the U.S./Europe.\n- Reports of vaccine shortages or inability to implement vaccination for travelers; hospital strain.\n- PAHO/WHO elevating risk assessments or CDC issuing interim updates beyond the April Level 2 alert.\n\nKey watchpoints for downward confidence (toward 0):\n- Continued absence of urban cases through mid-May; vaccination coverage increasing; CDC/PAHO updates maintaining Level 2; case growth stalls or declines.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the CDC raise the Travel Health Notice status of Colombia to above level 3 before June 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Colombia’s Economic Emergency As Yellow Fever Outbreak Threatens Tourism And Agricultural Exports](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/colombias-economic-emergency-as-yellow-fever-outbreak-threatens-tourism-and-agricultural-exports/) | CDC: [Travel Health Notices](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
