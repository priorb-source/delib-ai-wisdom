  "information": "Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney formally invited Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the G7 summit scheduled for June 15-17, 2025, in Kananaskis, Alberta. The invitation was extended in March 2025. On May 27, 2025, Zelenskyy confirmed his intention to go, stating to Ukrainian journalists, \"G7: I was invited by the Canadian Prime Minister Carney. And I will be.\" Canadian security planning documents list Zelenskyy among the expected attendees, prompting preparations including a no-fly-zone over the area.\n\nBetween 2022 and 2024, Volodymyr Zelenskyy participated in three G7 summits: he attended the 2023 summit in Hiroshima, Japan, in person, and attended the 2022 summit in Elmau, Germany, and the 2024 summit in Apulia, Italy, virtually. Throughout the war, he has made numerous international trips, including visits to Washington, Paris, and Davos. On June 2, 2025, he arrived in Vilnius, Lithuania, to attend the Bucharest Nine summit ahead of the NATO summit scheduled for June 24-25 in The Hague.\n\nA key topic of discussion related to the G7 summit is the potential for new sanctions against Russia. US Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal have advocated for a new package of sanctions to be coordinated with European allies before the summit. However, according to news reports citing EU diplomats, it is unlikely that the European Union will have a new sanctions package ready by mid-June. President Zelenskyy has publicly called for increased pressure on Russia and for joint sanctions to be agreed upon at the G7 level.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 12 days, as the summit is scheduled for June 15-17, 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes. President Zelenskyy has publicly accepted the invitation and confirmed he will attend, and the host nation (Canada) is proceeding with security preparations for his arrival.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "A sudden and severe escalation of the war in Ukraine, such as a major new Russian offensive, requires President Zelenskyy's presence in Kyiv, forcing him to cancel his in-person attendance. He may opt to attend virtually instead.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Events proceed as planned. President Zelenskyy travels to Kananaskis, Alberta, and physically participates in the G7 summit to personally lobby for continued support for Ukraine, as he has publicly stated he will.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based primarily on President Zelenskyy's recent and explicit public confirmation on May 27, 2025: 'I was invited... And I will be.' This strong statement of intent, coupled with the host nation's active security preparations for his arrival, makes his attendance the clear status quo. His past behavior supports this; he has a history of undertaking high-stakes international travel for crucial diplomatic engagements, including attending the 2023 G7 summit in person in Hiroshima. His current trip to Lithuania for another summit further demonstrates his willingness and ability to travel during the war.\n\nMy probability is not higher than 92% because of the inherent volatility of the situation. As the leader of a country at war, Zelenskyy's plans are subject to last-minute changes due to battlefield developments. A significant military crisis in the next two weeks could compel him to remain in Ukraine, making this the primary risk factor for a 'No' outcome. There is also a non-zero personal security risk associated with such high-profile travel.\n\nMy probability is not lower because the diplomatic and strategic value of attending the G7 in person is immense. It provides a unique opportunity to directly engage the leaders of the world's most powerful economies to secure vital military and financial aid and to push for further sanctions on Russia. The fact that an EU sanctions package is unlikely to be ready before the summit likely strengthens his resolve to attend and make his case personally. \n\nI would increase my forecast if there are confirmed reports of his departure for Canada. I would decrease my forecast significantly upon credible reports of a major Russian military breakthrough or a significant security incident in Ukraine that would demand his immediate attention.",
