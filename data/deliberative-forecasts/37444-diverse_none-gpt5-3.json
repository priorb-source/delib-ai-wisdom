    "review": "Both forecasters sharpen the status‑quo case. They add two useful points I underweighted: (1) the interagency coordination and political optics for a symbolic delisting are substantial relative to the short window; (2) the pipeline’s physical inoperability reduces any practical incentive to move quickly. They also correctly note that Congressional pushback, while not determinative procedurally, heightens perceived political cost. Neither introduced decisive new evidence, but their emphasis on timing/coordination costs within ~8 weeks is a meaningful nudge downward. One angle not discussed is a technical/administrative delisting if the entity is dissolved, but given the symbolism around Nord Stream 2 AG, I still view that as unlikely without a broader policy signal.",
    "rationale": "We have ~56 days until July 1. The White House/OFAC can act fast if they choose, and the Politico report is a genuine positive signal that a pathway exists. However, absent visible diplomatic movement (ceasefire, swaps, broader Russia package) or coordinated G7/EU signaling, the default is to maintain the SDN listing. The upcoming G7 (mid‑June) provides a theoretical window, but that forum is more likely to produce measures on Russian assets and enforcement rather than headline delistings. The political costs (domestic backlash, alliance optics) remain high, while the practical benefits are negligible given the pipeline’s status. A purely administrative delisting due to corporate dissolution is possible in principle but unlikely for such a high‑profile target within this timeframe. Netting these, I’m lowering modestly from my prior 28% to reflect the short runway and coordination costs while preserving some weight on the Politico signal and the executive’s ability to act quickly if a deal materializes. Up‑moves: credible reporting of an imminent June package including delistings, strong German/EU backing, or a diplomatic breakthrough. Down‑moves: public rejection by senior US officials, new Russian escalation, or reports that internal deliberations have concluded against relief.",
