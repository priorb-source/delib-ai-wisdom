    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Approximately 1.5 months",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The full-scale war with Russia continues through June 2025. Martial law remains in effect, which legally and practically prevents elections. The Ukrainian government and society continue to prioritize the war effort, and no election date is announced by the July 1, 2025 deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A sudden, major de-escalation of the conflict, such as a stable ceasefire, occurs. Under significant pressure from Western partners to show a roadmap for post-war governance, the Ukrainian government announces a date for a future presidential election, perhaps making it conditional on the end of martial law.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the overwhelming legal, practical, and political barriers to holding—or even announcing—an election in Ukraine under current conditions. The status quo is the continuation of the full-scale war and the corresponding state of martial law. The Ukrainian Constitution and the law on martial law prohibit elections during this period. Furthermore, there is a strong domestic consensus among political leaders and the public that attempting to hold elections would be dangerous, divisive, and a distraction from the primary goal of national defense. Logistical challenges, such as ensuring the franchise for millions of internally displaced persons, refugees abroad, and soldiers on the front line, as well as securing polling places from Russian attack, remain insurmountable. Given that the resolution date is only six weeks away, a dramatic reversal of these fundamental conditions is highly improbable. My probability is not lower than 2% because there is a small, non-zero chance of a black swan event. This could include a sudden collapse of the Russian front leading to a rapid ceasefire, or an unexpected and immense diplomatic pressure campaign from key allies that forces a declarative announcement of a future election date to secure a vital aid package. My forecast would move toward 'Yes' if there were a sudden, verifiable, and durable cessation of hostilities or if key Ukrainian officials publicly signaled a change in their stance on wartime elections. Conversely, a major escalation in the conflict would only strengthen my confidence in a 'No' outcome.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Ukraine announce a presidential election before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Next Ukrainian presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Ukrainian_presidential_election)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a specific date on which a presidential election will be held is officially announced by the government of Ukraine or any of its agencies that have the authority to do so. If no such announcement occurs before that date, this question resolves as No.\n\nThe election does not have to be held before July 1, 2025; this question resolves based on an announcement.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-16.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
