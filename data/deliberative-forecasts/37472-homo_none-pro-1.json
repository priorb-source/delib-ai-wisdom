    "review": "All three forecasters are in strong agreement on the fundamental analysis: the status quo of Sheikh Hasina remaining in exile in India is overwhelmingly the most likely outcome. We all concur that her public vows to return are political rhetoric, that she faces immediate arrest and prosecution in Bangladesh, and that the short timeframe (under two months) makes a negotiated return or a completed extradition process highly improbable. The primary point of divergence is the exact probability assigned to the low-likelihood event of her return, with forecasts ranging from 5% to 15%. I found Forecaster 2's reasoning particularly convincing. Their emphasis on India's vested interest in regional stability is a crucial point that I had not weighed heavily enough. India's desire to prevent destabilizing actions in its neighbor acts as a powerful brake on both a high-risk voluntary return by Hasina and any rapid extradition process. This geopolitical constraint significantly diminishes the already small chances of a 'Yes' resolution.",
    "rationale": "My initial forecast was 15%, based on the high personal risk to Sheikh Hasina but keeping a significant probability for her known political boldness and the volatility of the situation. After reviewing the other analyses, I am lowering my forecast to 5%. The decisive argument came from Forecaster 2, who highlighted that Sheikh Hasina's host country, India, has a strong strategic interest in maintaining stability in Bangladesh. This makes it highly unlikely that India would either permit a reckless, voluntary return from its soil or rush through a politically explosive extradition process within this very short timeframe. This geopolitical constraint makes the barriers to her return even higher than I had initially assessed. My original 15% placed too much emphasis on her personal agency and not enough on the structural and geopolitical realities that severely limit her options. A 5% forecast better reflects the remote possibility of an unpredictable event while acknowledging the powerful forces maintaining the status quo.",
