    "review": "Forecaster 2 contributed a key piece of evidence I hadn’t explicitly used: Trading Economics shows March 2025 at 2.5% and a persistent run below 3%. That materially increases confidence because a one‑month jump from 2.5% to ≥3.0% is uncommon absent a shock. Their focus on inertia and near-term timing of tariff effects is sound. Forecaster 3’s analysis is reasonable in structure but is handicapped by missing recent data; they themselves would move higher if Q1 was well below 3%, which aligns with F2’s point. The main residual risks are month-to-month volatility, the exact threshold (3.0% resolves No), and any definitional/seasonal-adjustment discrepancies on Trading Economics.",
    "rationale": "I’m updating up because of the new information that March printed 2.5% on the resolving source and that recent months have been <3%. Given the strong persistence in Mexico’s labor market, high informality that buffers shocks, and likely lagged effects of any tariff-related disruption, a sudden April jump above 3.0% looks unlikely. I retain some caution for data noise, possible seasonal-adjustment differences, and the hard cutoff at 3.0%. Net effect: I raise my forecast from 60% to 82%.",
