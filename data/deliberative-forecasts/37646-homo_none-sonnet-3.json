    "review": "All three analyses identify the same key factors: the license announcement is positive, the 47-day timeframe is tight, and there's a concerning absence of deployment information beyond the license. The main disagreement centers on how to weight these factors. Forecaster 3 (60%) makes compelling points I initially underweighted: (1) Musk's public announcements typically indicate serious commitment and follow-through, and (2) 47 days is actually reasonable time for a website update decision if there's intent to move quickly. Forecaster 2 (38%) usefully emphasizes specific operational requirements like local partnerships and payment infrastructure. However, I'm struck by a critical piece of evidence we all noted but perhaps didn't emphasize enough: Somalia is NOT currently listed as available DESPITE the license announcement already being made. This status quo strongly suggests there ARE additional steps beyond licensing before Starlink lists a country as 'Available.' If it were as simple as having a license, the website would likely already show Somalia. This temporal gap between license announcement and current non-listing is meaningful negative evidence that tempers Forecaster 3's optimism while supporting Forecaster 2's caution about organizational inertia.",
    "rationale": "After deliberation, I'm updating my forecast modestly upward from 40% to 47%. The update comes from giving more weight to two arguments: (1) Musk's track record of following through on public commitments deserves more credit than I initially gave, and (2) 47 days provides sufficient runway for a determined effort to update the availability map. However, I'm not moving as high as Forecaster 3's 60% because the critical evidence - that Somalia remains unlisted despite the license announcement already being public - strongly suggests additional operational or business steps are required before Starlink will update their map. The status quo is not 'license obtained but not yet listed'; it's 'license announced publicly but still not listed,' which implies a more deliberate process than just flipping a switch. This middle position at 47% reflects measured optimism about Musk's commitment while respecting the evidence that real barriers remain between licensing and listing.",
