  "information": "In late May 2025, President Trump granted clemency to a large group of individuals. News outlets including The Hill and Politomix reported on May 28-29 that over two dozen people received pardons or commutations in what was described as a 'clemency spree' or 'blitz'. According to Office of the Pardon Attorney data, there were approximately 25 clemency actions in May. The recipients included political allies like former Congressman Michael Grimm and former Connecticut governor John G. Rowland, reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, and musicians such as NBA YoungBoy.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "~32 days (through June 30, 2025; outcome clear once June disclosures are tallied)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — after a late‑May clemency blitz, a quiet June with 0–2 additional actions is the baseline",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The White House absorbs backlash from the late‑May spree and deliberately pauses; any additional actions are saved for a symbolic date like July 4. Only a trickle (0–2) of routine or previously queued clemencies are publicly disclosed in June, keeping the total at 2 or fewer.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Trump continues momentum with another small wave (≥3) in June—perhaps tied to Juneteenth or as drip‑feed celebrity/ally pardons—or issues a category/blanket action (e.g., for certain Jan. 6 defendants), easily surpassing the >2 threshold.",
    "rationale": "What we know: Per the research assistant, Trump just executed a late‑May clemency spree (≈25 actions reported May 28–29), including high‑profile allies and celebrities. That demonstrates both willingness and capacity to issue clemency in batches, and suggests a stocked pipeline. The question asks if he will grant clemency to more than 2 individuals in June 2025, counting any publicly disclosed pardons/commutations, including partial or blanket actions.\n\nReasoning: Good forecasting puts weight on the status quo: presidents often do clemency in bursts with long lulls. Trump’s first term followed that pattern (many months with zero actions, punctuated by big clusters). After a May blitz, the baseline expectation is a cooldown in June, possibly deferring the next batch to an attention‑grabbing moment like July 4. That argues for a No as the status quo outcome.\n\nCountervailing factors pushing toward Yes: (1) The threshold is low (>2). Even a modest June trickle—one announcement with three names—resolves Yes. (2) Momentum and pipeline: a spree implies many vetted cases ready to go, making follow‑on actions easier. (3) Political timing: Juneteenth provides a natural peg for clemency framed around criminal‑justice themes; Trump may also prefer intermittent news cycles via celebrity/ally cases. (4) He ignored critical coverage (e.g., Guardian’s May 2 piece) and proceeded with a large May round, suggesting limited sensitivity to blowback. (5) A blanket or categorical action at any point in June would trivially satisfy the condition.\n\nWhy not higher: Historically, Trump clusters clemency and can go weeks or months without any; post‑spree cooling and planning for a July 4 package are plausible. Internal process friction or political calculus could delay actions past June. Many months under past presidents, including Trump, had zero clemency events.\n\nWhy not lower: The bar is very low (just three individuals). The recent spree shows clear intent and operational capacity. There are multiple plausible June hooks (Juneteenth, ongoing ally/celebrity cases). Even minimal continued activity would tip this to Yes.\n\nWhat would move me up: Credible reporting or leaks of a June package (especially tied to Juneteenth), early‑June clemencies starting to post, or signals of a categorical/blanket action. What would move me down: Reporting that the White House is consolidating the next wave for July 4, internal pushback or staffing/process slowdowns, or explicit statements indicating a pause until July.\n\nSummary of assistant’s report influence: The reported May 28–29 clemency blitz (~25 actions, including notable allies and celebrities) materially increases the likelihood of at least a few more actions soon, but the clustering pattern also increases the chance of a June lull. Balancing those, I lean moderately Yes.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Donald Trump grant executive clemency to more than 2 individuals in June 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nGuardian: [Trump white-collar criminal pardons cost public $1bn, says ex-DoJ official](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/02/trump-pardons-cost-liz-oyer)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
