    "review": "Both forecasters make valuable points I need to consider. Forecaster 3's construction pipeline lag argument is particularly compelling - even with starts declining in March 2025, homes begun in late 2024/early 2025 will continue entering inventory through May. This is a mechanism I underweighted. However, I believe both forecasters are underweighting Forecaster 2's own observation about seasonal factors. May falls in peak buying season, which should increase absorption and work AGAINST inventory accumulation. This is a critical countervailing force. Both also frame the requirement as a 10% increase over 3 months from February, but the research assistant confirmed March data at 503,000, meaning we actually need 47,000+ units over just 2 months - requiring 4.7% MONTHLY growth. Currently we're seeing 0.6% monthly growth (500k to 503k). The required acceleration is extreme: we'd need to increase the growth rate roughly 8-fold. Even doubling current growth to 1.2% monthly would only reach ~509,000 by May. The pipeline lag supports continued growth, but not this magnitude of acceleration, especially during peak absorption season.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I'm updating my analysis but remain more bearish than my peers. Key updates to my thinking: (1) The construction pipeline lag is real and means completions will continue despite declining starts - this supports continued inventory growth. (2) March 2025 data at 503,000 confirms the upward trend is intact. (3) However, the math remains daunting: we need 4.7% monthly growth over 2 months when current growth is 0.6% monthly. (4) May's peak buying season should enhance absorption, creating headwinds for inventory accumulation. (5) Housing inventory has NEVER exceeded 550k outside the 2006-2007 bubble - this threshold represents an extreme outlier. While I'm increasing my forecast to acknowledge the pipeline lag factor and confirmed March data, I believe 38-40% significantly underweights both the required growth acceleration and seasonal absorption dynamics. The pipeline delivers gradual increases, not the dramatic surge needed.",
