    "review": "All three forecasters are in strong agreement on the core rationale. The primary factor driving a low probability is the extremely short timeframe—less than two months until the July 1, 2025 deadline. We all noted that the IPO preparation process is lengthy and complex, typically taking many months, and that there is a complete absence of public signals (e.g., news of hiring underwriters, confidentially filing) that would suggest an announcement is imminent. We also all agree that Anthropic's successful private fundraising reduces the immediate financial pressure to go public. The only real difference is the magnitude of the small probability assigned, with my and Forecaster 2's initial estimate at 10% and Forecaster 3's at 5%. This difference hinges on how much weight to give the possibility of a 'surprise' announcement in the uniquely dynamic AI sector versus the powerful inertia of standard corporate finance procedures.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other forecasts, I am updating my probability downward. My initial forecast of 10% and Forecaster 2's were based on the same sound logic, but I now find Forecaster 3's more conservative 5% estimate to be more compelling. The main reason for my update is a re-evaluation of the weight I gave to a potential 'surprise' announcement. While the AI industry is exceptionally fast-moving, the legal, financial, and regulatory mechanics of an IPO are quite rigid and slow-moving. A company cannot simply will an S-1 filing into existence overnight. The process requires months of intense work with numerous external partners (investment banks, law firms, auditors), making a complete secret extremely difficult to maintain. The absolute lack of any leaks or credible rumors that such work is underway is very strong negative evidence. This suggests that the logistical hurdles are a more significant barrier than the potential strategic incentive for a surprise. Therefore, I believe my initial 10% was slightly too high. I am lowering my forecast from 10% to 7%, moving closer to Forecaster 3's position while still leaving slightly more room than they did for a highly improbable but not impossible black swan event.",
