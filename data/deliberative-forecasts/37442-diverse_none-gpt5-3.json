    "review": "Both forecasters lean on the institutional inertia/base-rate argument, which I agree is the dominant consideration here. They also raise the plausible \"starter position being built\" path via Combs/Weschler. Neither adds concrete new evidence (price-path specifics, trade signals, or filings), but their emphasis that even a small add would clear the threshold is a fair reminder. What’s missing in their analyses: (1) Berkshire’s recent posture of being net sellers/liquidity-seeking, which tilts against adds; and (2) the possibility of confidential treatment while building, which would still resolve as No. Their 35% feels reasonable if you weight incremental-building a bit more; I’m still slightly lower due to recent Berkshire behavior and lack of a clear Q1 dip catalyst for DPZ.",
    "rationale": "My base case remains that Berkshire typically leaves most positions unchanged quarter-to-quarter, especially shortly after initiation, unless there is a clear price/catalyst to scale. Recent Berkshire commentary and positioning suggest caution and net selling into strength, which modestly reduces the odds of adding to DPZ in Q1. The countervailing points are: (a) the add needed to exceed 2,382,000 could be small; (b) Combs/Weschler sometimes build over multiple quarters; and (c) DPZ fits Berkshire’s quality bias. However, absent concrete signals (price downdrafts aligned with Berkshire buying, unusual volume, or filings/chatter), I keep the probability below 50. I slightly nudge up from 30% to reflect the small-threshold consideration and the non-trivial chance of incremental scaling, but remain below the other forecasters due to Berkshire’s recent net-seller stance and the possibility of confidential treatment masking any ongoing build in the public 13F, which would resolve as No.",
