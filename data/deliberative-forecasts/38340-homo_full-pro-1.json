    "review": "All three forecasters, including myself, have reached a high-confidence consensus. The unanimity in both the final probability (1%) and the core reasoning is striking. The key drivers identified are identical across all analyses: the ongoing civil war, the resulting collapse of state institutions (particularly the legislature required for ratification), Sudan's suspension from the African Union, and the extremely short timeframe of less than one month. No forecaster presented evidence or arguments that I had not considered; rather, their analyses strongly validated my initial assessment. I found their reasoning convincing as it is grounded in the fundamental realities of the political and security situation in Sudan. Forecaster 3's specific framing of the 'black swan' event as a potential, externally-brokered peace deal with ratification as a symbolic term was a useful way to conceptualize the minuscule probability, but it does not alter the overall assessment of it being a near-impossibility.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the other expert analyses, I am maintaining my forecast of 1%. The deliberation process has reinforced my initial conviction. The other forecasters did not introduce any new information or counterarguments that would cause me to adjust my probability either up or down. Our collective reasoning is based on the insurmountable barriers to ratification given the current context. A country in the midst of a civil war with a fragmented government and no functioning legislature lacks the fundamental prerequisites to formally ratify an international treaty. The deadline of July 1, 2025, is less than a month away, making the timeline for a potential peace accord, formation of a new government, and completion of the ratification process entirely implausible. The consensus among the forecasters confirms that this is the decisive factor, rendering prior work on an implementation strategy irrelevant. My forecast remains at 1% and not 0% solely to account for a highly improbable 'black swan' event, but there is no evidence to suggest such an event is even remotely likely. Therefore, based on the unanimous expert consensus and the unchanged factual basis, my forecast of 1% stands.",
