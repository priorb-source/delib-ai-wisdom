    "review": "New, decision-relevant info from the other forecasters: (1) A current U.S. rig count of 585 (I had implicitly anchored a bit higher). Being just 2 above the threshold means only a net -3 is needed by May 30, materially raising the Yes probability. (2) Recent week-to-week moves of -7 then +2 highlight typical volatility large enough to cross the threshold within a few weeks. (3) Y/y down ~34 rigs implies a mild negative drift (~-0.6/week). (4) Frac spread count down 10 to 195 suggests softer completion activity; while it’s a different part of the cycle than drilling, it’s directionally consistent with caution. (5) Q1 service company commentary (Halliburton, Baker Hughes) pointing to weaker North America activity supports a soft backdrop. I find the proximity-to-threshold and the service-company softness persuasive. I’m more cautious on leaning too heavily on frac spreads for drilling, and I think 75% overstates signal-to-noise over a 5–6 week horizon. The 47% feels a bit low given the closeness to 583 and the mild negative drift.",
    "rationale": "Updating from my prior 35% given: (a) Starting point of 585 means only a -3 net move over ~5–6 prints is needed; (b) baseline drift is modestly negative (y/y downtrend, Q1 OFS softness, Dallas Fed survey, WTI ~$64–65, weak gas), and (c) weekly volatility is commonly a few rigs, making a -3 over the horizon quite plausible. Counterweights: rig programs are sticky, and a small positive sequence could easily keep the final print ≥583. Net, I expect a slight negative drift with substantial noise, putting the terminal week modestly more likely below 583 than above, but nowhere near certainty. I therefore raise my forecast materially but keep it near coin-flip plus. If the next 1–2 reports print declines or WTI slides sub-$60, I’d move higher; stabilization or upticks would push me back toward 50% or lower.",
