    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The James Beard Foundation's voting body selects one of the female finalists as the winner, determining that she best exemplifies the values and skills the award represents.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on historical data and recent trends, as the specific list of 2025 finalists is not available. Historically, the Outstanding Chef award has been predominantly won by men. However, the last decade has shown a significant shift toward gender parity. From 2014 to 2024 (excluding the 2020/2021 hiatus), women have won the award 5 out of 10 times. This recent trend suggests a base rate approaching 50%. The James Beard Foundation also underwent a significant audit and restructuring post-2020 to promote greater equity and diversity, which theoretically supports a more balanced outcome. \n\nMy forecast is not higher than 45% because the last two winners (2023 and 2024) were men, which tempers the expectation of a sustained trend of female winners seen from 2018-2022. Without knowing the gender breakdown of the 2025 finalists, which is the most critical variable, it is difficult to justify a probability above 50%. Recently, nominee pools have been mixed but have sometimes featured more men than women (e.g., 4 men and 1 woman in 2023).\n\nMy forecast is not lower than 45% because the strong performance of female chefs in the last decade cannot be ignored. Five wins in ten years is a powerful indicator that a female winner is a very common outcome. A lower probability would unduly overweight the long-term history and discount the clear recent trend and the foundation's public commitment to diversity. \n\nMy forecast would increase significantly if the list of 2025 finalists features a majority of women or a widely acknowledged female frontrunner. Conversely, my forecast would decrease if the list of finalists is heavily skewed towards men.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
