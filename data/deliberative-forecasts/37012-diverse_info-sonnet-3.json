    "review": "Both forecasters present crucial information I overlooked. Forecaster 2 identifies that Conservatives currently hold 50 of 93 seats - a commanding 34-seat advantage over Labour's 16 seats. This starting position is far more important than I weighted in my initial analysis. Forecaster 3 adds critical context about the rural-heavy geography and multi-party fragmentation dynamics, plus the key insight that Reform historically underperforms at local level despite national polling. Both correctly emphasize the distinction between 'most seats' (plurality) and 'majority' - Conservatives could lose significant ground yet remain the largest party if opposition gains fragment across Labour (urban), Lib Dems (rural/suburban), and others. Their 54-60% range reflects this tension between national anti-Conservative sentiment and local structural advantages. My 28% forecast overweighted national trends and the Wellingborough result while completely missing the current council composition and fragmentation dynamics.",
    "rationale": "I significantly underestimated the Conservative Party's structural advantages. Starting from 50/93 seats provides an enormous buffer - even losing 15-20 seats would leave them around 30-35 seats in the new 76-seat council. For Labour to overcome this, they would need to more than double their representation from 16 seats to 39+ while Conservatives collapse by over a third. The multi-party opposition creates fragmentation: Labour gains concentrated in urban Northampton, Lib Dems targeting rural/suburban Conservative seats, Reform splitting right-wing votes but winning few seats themselves due to weak local organization. This fragmentation makes it plausible for Conservatives to remain the largest single party despite losing overall control. The Wellingborough parliamentary result, while significant, doesn't directly translate to multi-member ward local elections where incumbency, candidate quality, and vote-splitting matter more. Reform's 25% national polling likely translates to far fewer local seats, mainly helping Labour and Lib Dems by splitting Conservative votes. The rural geography of West Northamptonshire (combining Daventry, South Northants with Northampton) structurally favors Conservatives outside the urban core. I'm updating significantly upward to 52%, aligning closer to the other forecasters while maintaining some weight on the severe national headwinds facing Conservatives.",
