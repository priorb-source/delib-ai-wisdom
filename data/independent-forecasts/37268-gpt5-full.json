  "information": "As of early May 2025, Muqtada al-Sadr has publicly and repeatedly reaffirmed his boycott of the 2025 Iraqi parliamentary election. In April 2025, he rejected a plea from the Iraqi President to reconsider his decision, stating he would not participate with 'the corrupt'. In March 2025, he forbade his followers from voting or participating in the election. A Qatari report from late April indicated al-Sadr is unwilling to take responsibility for the political mistakes of the rival Shia Coordination Framework. During a speech on May 2, 2025, he told supporters to 'speak out if their speech benefits reform, and remain silent if silence benefits reform.'\n\nThe Iraqi government has set November 11, 2025, as the date for the parliamentary elections. The Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) announced that the registration period for political alliances would run from April 15 to May 4, 2025. The political landscape is marked by significant divisions within the Shia bloc. The Shiite Coordination Framework, a major coalition, plans to participate in the election with at least six separate lists, though they are in discussions to form a post-election coalition. The electoral law remains a point of contention among political blocs.\n\nMuqtada al-Sadr has a history of reversing decisions to boycott elections. He previously reversed boycotts in 2014 and 2021. The 2021 reversal occurred in mid-August, approximately two months before the election. Despite his current boycott, al-Sadr has urged his followers to update their voter registration records. Some political sources have discussed the possibility of al-Sadr participating indirectly through an independent list to maintain influence, a strategy he has used in the past. In June 2022, after his party won 73 seats in the 2021 election, he ordered his entire parliamentary bloc to resign.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 59 days (until July 1, 2025)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — Sadr maintains the boycott and there is no formal announcement that his movement will field candidates in the 2025 elections before July 1.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Sadr continues to denounce participation, reiterates instructions not to vote or run, and any political maneuvering happens indirectly (e.g., tacitly supported independents) without an explicit declaration that his movement will field candidates.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sadr publicly reverses the boycott and states that his movement (whether branded as Sairoon/Alliance Towards Reforms/Sadrist Movement or a rebrand) will field candidates in the Nov 11, 2025 election, accompanied by visible organizational steps (reactivating campaign offices, IHEC engagement, named campaign leads).",
    "rationale": "Baseline: As of early May 2025, Sadr has repeatedly and emphatically reaffirmed a boycott. He rejected the president’s plea in April, forbade followers from participating in March, and his May 2 remarks did not signal imminent electoral participation. This makes the status quo trajectory “No.”\nTiming: Sadr’s past boycott reversals (e.g., 2021) came close to the election. With the vote on Nov 11, a reversal by July 1 would be unusually early relative to his historical pattern of late-stage pivots. That lowers the near-term probability of an announcement within the question’s window.\nProcedural signals: IHEC’s April 15–May 4 alliance registration window being so tight reduces the likelihood of a near-term, formal alliance re-entry. While the resolution allows for name changes and would count a Sadrist-branded list, not just the 2018 Sairoon alliance, the lack of visible preparatory steps by early May still points against a quick July 1 announcement.\nCountervailing considerations: Sadr sometimes keeps options open (e.g., urging followers to update voter records) and has a record of tactical reversals (2014, 2021). The Shia Coordination Framework’s fragmentation could create an incentive to re-enter. However, these factors point more to a potential late-summer pivot than to an announcement before July 1.\nWhy not higher: Strong, repeated boycott messaging; no public concessions extracted; typical reversal timing is later; little evidence of immediate organizational ramp-up.\nWhy not lower: Sadr’s history of reversals, the strategic benefits of contesting a fragmented opponent, and subtle option-preserving signals (voter record updates) keep a non-trivial chance alive.\nWhat would move me up: Concrete softening of rhetoric (e.g., conditional participation statements), meetings with key clerical or state figures leading to face-saving concessions, visible reactivation of campaign structures, or IHEC timetable changes enabling/encouraging early participation declarations.\nWhat would move me down: Another categorical boycott decree with disciplinary threats for would-be candidates, organizational wind-downs, or clear moves to channel influence solely through protests/indirect independents without any formal announcement.",
