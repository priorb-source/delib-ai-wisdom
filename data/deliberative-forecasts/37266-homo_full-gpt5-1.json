    "review": "Both forecasters’ arguments are well-aligned with my prior view. They emphasize the high bar the State Department applies for a nationwide Level 4, the pattern of using regional Level 4s for localized insurgencies, the short ~60‑day window, and the importance of concrete triggers (e.g., ordered departure, major incidents in Maputo or key corridors, kidnappings of foreigners). Forecaster 3 adds a useful potential catalyst—any drawdown of Rwandan/SADC forces leading to broader loss of control—which I had not explicitly noted. Neither provides evidence that partner governments (UK/Canada) are moving to nationwide “Do Not Travel,” which would be an important leading signal. Overall, their reasoning is credible and consistent with historical DOS practice. The base‑rate and trigger framing reinforces, rather than shifts, my prior estimate.",
    "rationale": "Status quo remains Level 3 with region-specific higher warnings in the north. Recent incidents in Niassa and embassy alerts raise tail risk but still look geographically contained. The State Department typically escalates to Level 4 nationally only for widespread, systemic danger; Mozambique’s risk profile, while serious in Cabo Delgado and adjoining areas, does not yet meet that threshold. Key triggers that would change this quickly include: high‑profile attacks or kidnappings targeting foreigners; sustained attacks in major urban/transport hubs (Maputo, Nampula, Nacala, Beira); an ordered departure or drawdown at the U.S. Embassy; or a significant deterioration tied to any Rwandan/SADC force changes. Partner advisories remain regional, which also argues against an imminent U.S. nationwide Level 4. With ~60 days left, the base rate for a Level 3→Level 4 countrywide jump is low. Given no new decisive evidence beyond what I already considered, I’m keeping my estimate steady.",
