  "information": "Mahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and Palestinian activist, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March 2025. An immigration judge subsequently ruled that he can be deported, concluding that the government had met its burden to prove grounds for deportation based on national security and foreign policy concerns. Khalil's legal team is appealing this decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) and has also filed a separate habeas corpus petition in federal court, arguing that the government's actions violate his First Amendment rights.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 47 days (until 2025-07-01)",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — he is not deported by July 1, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "His timely appeal to the BIA automatically stays the IJ’s removal order, the BIA does not resolve the case before July 1 (or issues a remand), and/or a federal court maintains an injunction or stay. Even if DHS pushes to remove, logistical hurdles (e.g., travel documents and flight coordination) prevent execution before the deadline.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The BIA grants DHS’s request to expedite and swiftly affirms the removal order; Khalil does not obtain a stay from any court; ICE already has or quickly secures travel documents and executes the removal within days of the BIA decision, all before July 1, 2025.",
    "rationale": "Summary of received info: Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and Palestinian activist, was detained by ICE in March 2025. An IJ ruled he can be deported on national security/foreign policy grounds. His team has appealed to the BIA and filed a habeas petition in federal court alleging First Amendment violations.\n\nCore reasoning: The status quo favors no removal by July 1. A timely BIA appeal generally stays execution of the IJ’s removal order; the IJ’s decision is not final while the appeal is pending. BIA adjudications often take months; even when expedited, turning an IJ decision into a final, executable order quickly is nontrivial. Separately, the pending federal case increases the chance of a TRO or preliminary injunction, or at least additional delay. Finally, practical removal logistics (securing travel documents and routing travel, especially if removal would be to Palestinian territories or via a third country) can add time even after a final order.\n\nWhy not higher: The automatic stay during a BIA appeal, typical BIA timelines, the possibility of federal court intervention, and likely logistical hurdles all make removal within ~7 weeks unlikely.\n\nWhy not lower: National security/foreign policy grounds can prompt DHS to seek expedited handling. The BIA can move quickly in some cases. If the BIA summarily affirms within weeks, and no court grants a stay, ICE could remove quickly, particularly if travel documents are already in hand. These pathways, while not the base case, are plausible enough to keep the probability above near-zero.\n\nWhat would move me upward: Evidence the BIA has granted expedited review with a compressed briefing schedule or imminent decision; reporting that travel documents are secured and a removal is scheduled; denial of any stay/TRO by the federal court and indications the court views the habeas as jurisdictionally barred; indications the respondent will or did waive further stays.\n\nWhat would move me downward: A BIA briefing schedule that runs past July 1, a continuance or remand; any federal court TRO/preliminary injunction against removal; credible reporting of unresolved travel-document issues or country-of-return complications; expansion of related litigation that signals prolonged proceedings.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Mahmoud Khalil be deported before July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[Mahmoud Khalil's challenge to his detention moves forward]()\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the United States deports Mahmoud Khalil before July 1, 2025. For purposes of this question, \"deported\" means Khalil being transported out of the territory of the United States against his will.\n\n\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nMahmoud Khalil, a lawful permanent resident and Palestinian activist, was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in March 2025. An immigration judge subsequently ruled that he can be deported, concluding that the government had met its burden to prove grounds for deportation based on national security and foreign policy concerns.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
