    "review": "The deliberation reveals a strong consensus among all three forecasters. We independently identified the same core drivers: 1) a strong underlying growth trend in Q1 2025, 2) significant increases in airline seat capacity for spring 2025, and 3) the highly consequential shift of the entire Easter holiday period into April 2025 (versus late March in 2024). These factors all point powerfully toward a 'No' outcome (i.e., growth). We also all identified the April 28th power outage as the primary countervailing risk. I found my peers' reasoning highly convincing, particularly their efforts to quantify the outage's impact. Framing it as approximately 0.2% of one month's traffic (Forecaster 2) or a potential loss of 5,000-15,000 passengers against a monthly total of around 2 million (Forecaster 3) effectively contextualized the event and reinforced the conclusion that its impact would be minor and insufficient to reverse the strong positive trends.",
    "rationale": "My reasoning remains fundamentally aligned with my initial analysis, but this deliberation has strengthened my conviction in a 'No' outcome. The consensus view, and especially the independent quantification of the power outage's small-scale impact by the other forecasters, has reduced my assessment of the downside risk. The evidence for year-over-year growth in April is multifaceted and robust: a pre-existing growth trend, expanded airline capacity, and, most importantly, the full inclusion of the Easter holiday peak. The outage on April 28th was a real but limited disruption. Occurring in the last three days of the month, its impact is highly unlikely to negate the cumulative gains from the preceding 27 days, which included a major travel holiday. Therefore, I am updating my forecast to reflect a higher degree of confidence that arrivals will not fall. I am lowering my probability for a 'Yes' outcome from 15% to 12%. This small adjustment reflects the increased confidence gained from the coherent and mutually reinforcing analyses of my peers, while still acknowledging the small, unquantified tail risk associated with a last-minute disruption.",
