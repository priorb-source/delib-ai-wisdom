  "information": "The 13-year gas transmission agreement between Bulgaria’s state-owned gas company Bulgargaz and Turkey’s BOTAŞ was signed in January 2023. The contract includes a 'take or pay' clause, obligating Bulgargaz to pay approximately $580,000 per day regardless of whether it uses the reserved capacity. Since July 2024, Bulgargaz has ceased payments, accumulating a debt reported to be around 4 billion leva (approximately €2 billion). Bulgarian officials have stated the company does not have the financial capacity to pay this debt, and Bulgargaz reportedly expects to incur a loss of 280 million leva in 2024.\n\nBulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has publicly stated to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that 'Bulgaria Needs Out of the Botas Gas Deal.' Former Bulgarian Deputy Energy Minister Zhecho Stankov stated that termination of the contract is blocked until the outstanding debt is fully settled. Despite the public statements, talks between the two countries as of May 2, 2025, focused on price and capacity renegotiation rather than outright cancellation. Turkey has publicly maintained a stance of viewing Bulgaria as a strategic partner and has opposed cancellation.\n\nIn early June 2025, Russian energy company Gazprom abandoned its plan to build a major gas distribution hub in Turkey. Reports cited insufficient pipeline capacity from Turkey to Greece and Bulgaria as a key reason for the project's lack of feasibility. Separately, Bulgaria has pursued other energy initiatives, signing gas exploration and drilling agreements with Shell and NewMed for blocks in the Black Sea. Bulgaria also has reserved 1 billion cubic meters of gas per year from the Alexandroupolis LNG terminal in Greece.",

    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 25 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The agreement remains formally in place despite Bulgaria's non-payment and stated desire to exit",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Negotiations continue focused on renegotiating price and capacity terms, with no formal cancellation announcement made by either party before July 1, 2025. The debt issue remains unresolved but the contract continues to exist on paper despite being dishonored.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Bulgaria unilaterally announces cancellation of the agreement citing financial impossibility, or Turkey announces cancellation due to Bulgaria's sustained non-payment and accumulated €2 billion debt. Either announcement would satisfy the resolution criteria even if disputed by the other party.",
    "rationale": "The situation presents a classic tension between an unsustainable status quo and the difficulty of formally canceling international agreements. Bulgaria has stopped payments since July 2024, accumulated approximately €2 billion in debt, and PM Borissov has publicly stated Bulgaria needs out of the deal. However, several factors suggest cancellation is unlikely in the remaining timeframe: (1) As recently as May 2, 2025 - just over a month ago - negotiations focused on renegotiation rather than cancellation; (2) Former Deputy Energy Minister stated termination is blocked until debt is settled; (3) Turkey opposes cancellation and views Bulgaria as a strategic partner; (4) The agreement has persisted for 11 months of non-payment without cancellation; (5) Only 24 days remain for a formal announcement. While Bulgaria has secured alternative gas sources (Alexandroupolis LNG, Black Sea exploration with Shell and NewMed), suggesting reduced need for Turkish capacity, formal cancellation of major state-to-state agreements typically requires extensive internal deliberation, legal review, and diplomatic coordination that is difficult to compress into less than a month. The question's criteria that unilateral termination counts even if denied provides some upside, as Bulgaria could theoretically make a desperate unilateral declaration. However, with €2 billion in debt, Bulgaria faces significant legal and diplomatic consequences for such a move. The forecast is not higher because recent negotiations show both parties still engaging on renegotiation terms rather than preparing for cancellation. It's not lower because the financial situation is genuinely dire and Bulgargaz reportedly faces bankruptcy, which could force dramatic action. I would update higher if there were reports of emergency government meetings, ultimatums issued, or shifts from renegotiation to cancellation discussions. I would update lower if new reports showed progress on debt restructuring or capacity renegotiation.",

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
