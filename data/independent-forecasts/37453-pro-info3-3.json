  "information": "The discussion around a potential referendum occurs amid heightened tensions between Alberta and the federal government over energy policies, the carbon tax, and fiscal distribution, particularly following the re-election of the federal Liberal party. The proposal has faced opposition from within Alberta. Leaders of the Sturgeon Lake and Mikisew Cree Nations have publicly opposed an independence referendum, stating their treaties were with the Crown, not the province. The official provincial opposition, the New Democratic Party of Alberta, has accused Premier Smith of promoting separatism.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "Less than 2 months.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "The government of Alberta will not officially announce a date for an independence referendum.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The Alberta government continues to use the threat of a referendum as a negotiating tactic with the federal government but avoids calling one due to internal opposition, lack of majority public support for separation, and the significant economic and political risks involved. The July 1, 2025 deadline passes without an official announcement.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "A new, major conflict erupts between Alberta and the federal government over a critical issue like a Supreme Court ruling or a new energy policy. In response, Premier Smith's government makes a high-risk political move to galvanize its base and assert sovereignty by officially announcing a date for an independence referendum.",
    "rationale": "My forecast is based on the high bar required for such a drastic political step and the very short timeframe before the deadline. The status quo, in which Alberta remains a province of Canada without a pending referendum, is a powerful default. While tensions with the federal government are high, calling an independence referendum is a move of last resort, not a standard political tactic. Key factors supporting a 'No' outcome include: the consistent lack of majority support for independence in public opinion polls, making a referendum incredibly risky for the premier; significant internal opposition within Alberta, including from the official opposition NDP and key First Nations, as highlighted in the research; and the immense economic instability that the mere announcement of a referendum would cause. The threat of a referendum is a more powerful bargaining chip for the Alberta government than an actual referendum they would likely lose. The timeline of less than two months is too short to build the necessary political consensus for such a monumental decision. My probability is not lower than 5% because the political situation is volatile, and Premier Smith has a history of pursuing unconventional policies to assert provincial autonomy. A sudden escalation in federal-provincial conflict could trigger an unexpected announcement. My probability is not higher because the practical political and economic barriers are substantial. For me to increase my forecast, I would need to see a dramatic shift in polling to a clear majority supporting independence or a major, unforeseen hostile action by the federal government that forces the Premier's hand.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nBefore July 1, 2025, will the government of Alberta officially announce a date for an independence referendum?\n\nQuestion background:\nPolitico: [The quiet threat to Canadian unity isn’t Quebec — it’s Alberta](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/the-quiet-threat-to-canadian-unity-isnt-quebec-its-alberta-00311719)\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if, before July 1, 2025, a referendum on the independence of Alberta from Canada is officially scheduled. If this does not occur before that date, this question resolves as **No**.\n\nFor purposes of this question, the referendum will be considered \"officially scheduled\" when it is announced by a person or entity with the authority to do so within Alberta. Please note that broader legality, such as within Canada, will be considered irrelevant for this question, so if the federal government declared the referendum illegal, the question would still resolve as Yes.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nThe discussion around a potential referendum occurs amid heightened tensions between Alberta and the federal government over energy policies, the carbon tax, and fiscal distribution, particularly following the re-election of the federal Liberal party. The proposal has faced opposition from within Alberta. Leaders of the Sturgeon Lake and Mikisew Cree Nations have publicly opposed an independence referendum, stating their treaties were with the Crown, not the province. The official provincial opposition, the New Democratic Party of Alberta, has accused Premier Smith of promoting separatism.\n\nToday is 2025-05-07.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
