  "information": "In response to the DHS action, Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the administration. On May 23, 2025, a federal judge granted Harvard a temporary restraining order (TRO), which has halted the enforcement of the SEVP certification revocation. As a result of the TRO, Harvard's certification is currently considered active. The university's lawsuit alleges that the administration's actions are unconstitutional retaliation that violates the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. A court hearing to determine whether a preliminary injunction will be issued is scheduled for May 29.",
  "forecast": {
    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "34 days until July 1, 2025",
    "status_quo_outcome": "Yes - Harvard currently has SEVP certification due to the temporary restraining order granted on May 23, 2025",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "The court denies Harvard's preliminary injunction at the May 29 hearing, the TRO expires, and the revocation takes effect before July 1. Alternatively, an appellate court could issue an emergency stay reversing the lower court's order, or the administration could find a procedural path to reinstate the revocation despite the court order.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "The preliminary injunction is granted at the May 29 hearing and remains in effect through July 1. Alternatively, the administration voluntarily restores certification as part of a settlement, or the court rules definitively in Harvard's favor before July 1. The TRO continuing in effect without being challenged would also result in Yes.",
    "rationale": "The status quo strongly favors a Yes outcome since Harvard's SEVP certification is currently active under the May 23 temporary restraining order. The granting of a TRO is highly significant - it indicates the judge found Harvard demonstrated: (1) likelihood of success on the merits, (2) irreparable harm, (3) balance of equities in their favor, and (4) that public interest supports the order. These same factors typically lead to preliminary injunctions being granted. Harvard's legal claims appear substantive - allegations of First Amendment retaliation, due process violations, and Administrative Procedure Act violations are serious charges that courts take seriously, particularly regarding academic freedom. The May 29 preliminary injunction hearing will likely extend these protections through July 1 given the TRO was already granted. However, several factors prevent a higher forecast: (1) This involves the politically charged Trump administration in an area (immigration/national security) where courts sometimes defer to executive authority, (2) Appeals or emergency stays could occur, (3) Only 34 days creates time pressure but also room for unexpected developments, (4) The specific judge and circuit matter significantly. The forecast isn't lower because: (1) The TRO is already in place and functioning, (2) The timeline is relatively short, (3) Courts historically protect academic freedom, (4) The administration's actions appear arbitrary and retaliatory based on the available facts. I would update higher (90%+) if the preliminary injunction is granted on May 29. I would update lower (60-70%) if the preliminary injunction is denied or if there are signs of appellate intervention.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill Harvard University have a Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification on July 1, 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\nThe Trump administration and Harvard University have been through a significant confrontation, since Trump took office for the second time. This [started](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/harvard-university-trump.html) with a task force commissioned by Trump to address antisemitism on campus, but quickly spiralled out of control. The administration asked Harvard to provide detailed records on foreign students, including disciplinary actions and involvement in protests, and demanded that Harvard implement changes to its admissions, hiring, and diversity policies. Harvard refused, citing concerns over academic freedom and student privacy. In response, the administration froze or pulled almost \\$4 billion in federal grants and contracts to Harvard and its research partners. Harvard filed a lawsuit against the administration, accusing it of attempting to interfere in academic decision-making and penalising the institution for resisting politically motivated demands.\r\n\r\nThe situation escalated on May 22, 2025, when the Department of Homeland Security [revoked](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/22/us/politics/trump-harvard-international-students.html) Harvard's certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, effectively barring the university from enrolling international students for the 2025–2026 academic year. This action affects approximately 6,800 international students or 27% of Harvard's student body, who must now transfer to other institutions or risk losing their legal status. The administration justified the move by accusing Harvard of fostering a \"toxic campus climate,\" failing to protect Jewish students, and allegedly collaborating with the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question will resolve as **Yes** if, on July 1, 2025, Harvard University has a certification under the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) programme allowing international students to enroll, according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\n* An announcement that Harvard's certification will be restored on a date after July 1, 2025 will not suffice to resolve this question. The certification needs to be in effect for this to resolve.\r\n* Getting the certification at any point on July 1, 2025 would resolve this question as **Yes**.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nIn response to the DHS action, Harvard University filed a lawsuit against the administration.

Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
