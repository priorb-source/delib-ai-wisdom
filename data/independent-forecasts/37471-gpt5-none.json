    "time_left_until_outcome_known": "About 7 weeks; May 2025 value should be published in the New Residential Sales release in late June 2025.",
    "status_quo_outcome": "No — the series was ~500 thousand in Feb 2025; absent an unusually large run-up, it remains below 550 thousand by May.",
    "no_outcome_scenario": "Monthly gains remain modest (e.g., +3k to +10k per month) with inventory ending May around 510–530k as spring sales and builder caution keep listings from ballooning.",
    "yes_outcome_scenario": "Sales weaken noticeably while completions and spec listings rise, producing outsized monthly jumps (e.g., +15–20k per month), pushing inventory above 550k by May.",
    "rationale": "The latest cited data point is 500k in Feb 2025 (seasonally adjusted, end-of-month). To exceed 550k by May would require roughly a 10% increase (about +50k) in three months. Historically, the New One Family Homes for Sale series changes relatively slowly, with typical monthly moves in the low single-digit thousands; a +50k increase over three months would be unusually large. Spring seasonality and builder behavior also argue for moderation: spring selling can draw down inventory, and builders have been cautious on starts amid elevated mortgage rates, limiting the risk of a rapid inventory glut. While higher completions from prior starts and soft demand could lift for-sale counts, reaching 550k so quickly would likely require either a sharp deterioration in sales, an unusually large pipeline release into “for sale,” or both. I place extra weight on the status quo (world changes slowly), which points below 550k. Why not higher: the magnitude and speed required are atypical; we would be nearing late-2000s peak territory. Why not lower: the February level is already elevated; if mortgage rates stay high or rise and new home sales slip while completions increase, inventory could climb faster than usual. What would move me up: March/April prints coming in ≥520k with accelerating gains; evidence of sharp sales slowdown, rising cancellations, or a notable spike in spec inventory from major builders. What would move me down: stronger spring sales, declining mortgage rates boosting absorption, or guidance from large builders showing tighter spec pipelines. The research assistant provided no additional data; forecast relies on series behavior, the Feb 2025 level, and typical dynamics between sales, starts, and completions.",

  "prompt": "You are a professional forecaster interviewing for a job.\n\nYour interview question is:\nWill the number of new single family homes for sale in the US exceed 550 thousand in May 2025?\n\nQuestion background:\n[The Kobeissi Letter](https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1912142359577403619): \"BREAKING: The number of new single-family homes for sale has surged to 500,000 in February, the highest since November 2007.\n\nThe number of new homes on the market has more than TRIPLED over the last 13 years, from a low of 142,000.\n\nExcluding the 2006 housing bubble this is, by far, the largest supply of new homes in history.\"\n\n\nThis question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:\nThis question resolves as **Yes** if the number of New One Family Homes for Sale in the United States reported for May 2025 is greater than 550 thousand, according to what is presented by [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/HNFSEPUSSA).\n\nEnsure units is set to \"Thousands of Units, Seasonally Adjusted\" and frequency is set to \"Monthly, End of Month\". Question resolves based on the number presented by FRED, and no other resolution source will be considered.\n\n\nYour research assistant's report says:\nNo additional information available.\n\nToday is 2025-05-08.\n\nBefore answering you think:\n(a) The time left until the outcome to the question is known.\n(b) The status quo outcome if nothing changed.\n(c) A brief description of a scenario that results in a No outcome.\n(d) A brief description of a scenario that results in a Yes outcome.\n(e) You write your rationale remembering that good forecasters put extra weight on the status quo outcome since the world changes slowly most of the time. Explain your reasoning and the evidence behind your forecast in detail. Summarise information your received from your research assistant that influences your forecast (if any). Explain why your forecast is not higher, and why it is not lower. Outline what would need to be true for you to update your forecast in either direction.\n(f) The last thing you write is your final probabilistic forecast as a number between 0 and 100.\n\n# OUTPUT SCHEMA\n{\n    \"time_left_until_outcome_known\": \"string\",\n    \"status_quo_outcome\": \"string\",\n    \"no_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"yes_outcome_scenario\": \"string\",\n    \"rationale\": \"string\",\n    \"probability\": \"number\" (0-100)\n}"
