    "review": "Both forecasters sharpen the key point I underweighted: the very low bar (only one recognition needed) combined with a focal event engineered to elicit exactly that outcome. The Axios report about Malta preparing an announcement is the most concrete catalyst; if accurate, it materially lifts odds. I agree with their emphasis on the conference as a political deadline and on France’s pivotal signaling. Where I’m less convinced is Forecaster 2’s 75%: Macron’s stated conditions and habitual slippage in diplomatic choreography, plus US/G7 headwinds, keep the risk of deferral non-trivial. I also flag some ambiguity in the Malta report’s phrasing (“declare independence” vs formal recognition) and a small chance Malta already counts as a recognizer in some tallies—both would blunt that signal. Still, their arguments justify moving above my prior.",
    "rationale": "Baseline absent the conference is low single-digit odds for any of the 46 holdouts to move in a given month. June is atypical: a UN conference (June 17–20) co-chaired by France/Saudi is explicitly intended to prompt recognitions; France has publicly entertained recognition (with conditions); the UK has aligned with the initiative; and Axios reports Malta may use the summit for an announcement. Since only one recognition is needed for a Yes, even a single credible candidate (Malta) plus optionality from France or a small EU state (e.g., Malta/Portugal/Luxembourg/Belgium/Greece) lifts the probability meaningfully above 50%. Countervailing risks are real: Macron’s conditionality could delay France and any microstate linked to it; US/Israeli pushback may persuade waverers to wait for a ceasefire/governance package; the Malta report could be walked back or refer to a non-recognition “declaration.” On balance, the focal timing and multiple potential paths to a single June recognition outweigh the inertia, but not by a huge margin. I’m updating up modestly from 52% to reflect the conference deadline and the Malta report while retaining caution for slippage and conditions.",
