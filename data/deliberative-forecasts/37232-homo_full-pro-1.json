    "review": "Both other forecasters arrived at a slightly higher probability (75%) than my initial 70%, but their underlying reasoning was almost identical to my own. We all identified the same key drivers: 1) The current flight hiatus significantly reduces the natural cadence of newsworthy events. 2) The most predictable news trigger for May, the Q1 earnings release, has a strong precedent of being sequestered in the Investor Relations section and not appearing on the main News page. 3) The status quo is a multi-month period of no posts. Neither forecaster introduced new evidence, but their shared confidence and crisp articulation of the core arguments were persuasive. They reinforced the strength of the evidence pointing towards a 'Yes' outcome, making the case for a random, ad-hoc post seem slightly less likely than I had originally weighted it.",
    "rationale": "After reviewing the analyses from the other forecasters, I am updating my forecast from 70% to 75%. The deliberation process confirmed that my initial reasoning was sound, but the consensus view at a slightly higher probability has convinced me to adjust. The unanimity on the core drivers—the flight hiatus and the separate channel for financial news—strengthens the conviction behind the forecast. I now believe I slightly underestimated the inertia of the current 'no-post' status quo and overestimated the chance of an unscheduled, strategic PR post occurring specifically in May. Aligning with the other forecasters at 75% better reflects the high probability that the company's recent communication patterns will continue for another month, while still accounting for the 25% possibility of an unforeseen announcement related to manufacturing, partnerships, or other corporate developments.",
