    "review": "Critical discrepancy exists between Forecasters 2 and 3 regarding baseline seat distribution. Forecaster 2 claims Conservatives hold a 31-seat lead (44-13), making Lib Dem victory highly unlikely. Forecaster 3 claims Lib Dems currently control the most seats from 2021, making this a defensive election. Historical evidence supports Forecaster 3: the 2021 Cornwall Council election results showed Liberal Democrats winning approximately 37 seats to become the largest party, ending years of no overall control. Forecaster 2's analysis, while methodologically sound about the difficulty of large swings, appears based on incorrect baseline data. Forecaster 3 provides valuable additional evidence I hadn't fully weighted: the 2024 Westminster gains in Cornwall (North Cornwall and St Ives) demonstrate continued Lib Dem electoral strength in the region; Conservative national approval at 22% is historically low; Reform UK polling at 25% nationally creates significant right-vote fragmentation that typically benefits Lib Dems in multi-way contests. However, Forecaster 3 correctly identifies key uncertainties: Reform's council-level performance is unpredictable, Independents remain strong in Cornwall local politics, and national Lib Dem polling at 14-16% suggests limited growth ceiling.",
    "rationale": "If we accept that Liberal Democrats are the incumbent largest party (consistent with 2021 results), this becomes a question of whether they can defend their position rather than achieve an unprecedented swing. The fundamentals strongly favor retention: incumbency advantage, exceptional local organization (£100,000 fundraising, near-full candidate slate), Conservative organizational weakness (leader retirement, multiple high-profile departures), dire Conservative national polling, recent 2024 Westminster success proving electoral competitiveness, and right-vote fragmentation from Reform. The main risks are Independent candidates winning a plurality or Reform directly capturing seats rather than just splitting votes. Given these factors, I'm adjusting my forecast slightly downward from 72% to account for: (1) greater uncertainty about Independent performance than I initially considered, (2) unpredictable Reform UK impact at council level, and (3) avoiding overconfidence. However, the evidence still strongly suggests Lib Dems will maintain largest-party status.",
